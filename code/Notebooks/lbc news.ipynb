      "\n",
      "Black Friday deals have already started popping up across major UK retailers - here’s everything you need to know about the event and how to get the best bargains. Black Friday is one of the biggest shopping dates of the year, which sees thousands of brands launch special sales to mark the occasion. It marks the beginning of the Christmas shopping period. Although it started off as a one-day event it has now spread to a month of deals for customers. Black Friday started in the US, marking the first Friday after Thanksgiving. Thanksgiving is a federal holiday modelled on a harvest festival that has been celebrated since the 1600s. Most employees and schools have the celebration off as well as the following Friday, meaning the get a four-day weekend which opens up the opportunity for more shopping. Black Friday 2024 is on November 29 but deals have already begun in the lead up to the big day. John Lewis, Argos and Boots are among the brands to have already kicked off their sales. Most of the deals will come to an end at midnight on Cyber Monday, which was originally when online deals began. Major retailers including Amazon and John Lewis have launched sales this month to mark Black Friday. Several fashion brands have also started Black Friday sales across stores and online, including New Look and ASOS. Sephora UK and Boots are among beauty brands taking part too. The event originally earned its name because of the congestion created by shoppers. It is also the day shops \"move into the black\" and have enough money to cover costs after being in the red. Research and know what you want to buy - Planning what you want to get out of the deals in advance and researching the best items will help you get the best out of Black Friday. Avoid impulse buying - Impulse buying can result in you benefitting less from the deals and spending more than intended. Make a list of what you want to buy and stick with it. Check RRP - Keep an eye on product pricing in the lead up to the sales so you can know which discounts are best on Black Friday. Compare prices across different retailers - Thousands of brands take part in the shopping event, so comparing prices between places can ensure you're getting the cheapest price and saving even more. Be aware of unusual brands - Despite deals coming in from all types of retailers, you should be aware of lesser known brands as they may not always be as reliable or similar in quality. Set up online accounts before the sales begin - Popular products can sell out quick when deals drop. Saving your details in an account will help secure the goods with a faster checkout. Check the returns policy - Buying online allows you to change your mind and demand a full refund within 14 days of delivery. Many stores also offer extended returns in the lead up to Christmas.\n",

      "Fifty years ago, on November 7, 1974, the dead body of a children’s nanny, Sandra Rivett, was discovered in a mail sack in the basement of a Belgravia townhouse.\n",
      "The chief suspect was the father of the children, an Eton-educated gambler called Richard John Bingham, the seventh earl of Lucan, who had vanished.  While most of Lord Lucan’s friends and family insisted that he had taken his own life, no body has ever been found. The manhunt for Lucan has lasted decades. Read More: Is Lord Lucan alive? Computer expert says elderly man in Australia's face is 'conclusively' same as vanished killer Read More: Three missing Cluedo cards discovered in Lord Lucan's car deepen nanny murder mystery Who was Lord Lucan? Richard John Bingham was the seventh Earl of Lucan, whose great-great-grandfather ordered the Charge of the Light Brigade, and whose father was a socialist peer who served in Clement Atlee's government. Born in 1934, Lucan went to Eton, did National Service in the Coldstream Guards, and briefly worked at Brandt's merchant bank in London. A spectacular win at chemin de fer (worth £26,000, when his annual salary was only £500) convinced him to become a professional gambler. He did not thrive: his nickname, \"Lucky\", was ironic. Even so, he lived a ritzy lifestyle, driving powerboats, racing bobsleighs and owning race horses; his suave demeanour led to him apparently being considered for the screen role of James Bond.  How was his marriage?    Lord Lucan was a snob who reportedly refused to talk to people who \"didn't have proper shoelaces\", but he still married a middle-class woman, Veronica Duncan, in 1963; she was the sister-in-law of his friend Bill Shand-Kydd.  Soon after, his father died and he succeeded to the earldom. The couple had three children, but Lady Lucan suffered from postnatal depression and the marriage gradually fell apart. He tried to have her committed to a psychiatric hospital, and they separated in 1973. A bitter custody battle ensued; Lucan became obsessed with the idea that she was incapable of raising his children, but he lost the court case, running up huge legal fees in the process.   What happened on the night of Thursday 7 October 1974? At around 9:45pm, Lady Lucan stumbled from her home on Lower Belgrave Street into the nearby Plumber's Arm. drenched in blood and screaming: \"Help me, help me, help me! I have just escaped from being murdered! He's in the house! He's murdered the nanny!\" It transpired that at around  9pm, she had asked her nanny, Sandra Rivett, 29, to make a cup of tea. Rivett had gone down to the basement kitchen. When she did not reappear, Lady Lucan had gone down to investigate, and had been attacked by a man whose voice she said she recognised as her husband's.  After fighting him and convincing him to stop the attack; she said that he admitted to having killed Rivett (by mistake). After he had taken her up to her bedroom, she managed to escape. When the police arrived, they found Rivett's body in a sack, with a bloody lead pipe that had been used to beat her to death.  What Lucan did after the attack? He left London and arrived at his friend Ian Maxwell-Scott's home, in Uckfield in Sussex, at 11:30pm. His told Susan Maxwell-Scott that he had had a \"traumatic night of unbelievable coincidence.\" While passing the family house he seen an intruder struggling with his wife in the basement. He had run in to help, and the man had run off. Realising that his wife would accuse him of being responsible and that the evidence looked damning, he said he had decided to \"lie doggo for a while\".  The last confirmed sighting of Lucan was him leaving Uckfield in the early hours of Friday. His car was found near the harbour in Newhaven, 16 miles away; it had been parked between 5am and 8am.  What is the evidence against him? In a landmark inquest in June 1975, it took a jury just 31 minutes to find that Lucan had murdered Rivett. This was based on Lady Lucan's testimony, and on a wealth of other details.  The car Lucan was using, a Ford Corsair, was found splattered with blood types matching both Rivett and Lady Lucan, along with another length of pipe, similar to the murder weapon. Lucan had borrowed a car, perhaps because it was less conspicuous than his Mercedes, and had found out from his daughter that the nanny's night off was on Thursdays, though she in fact swapped her days that week.  He knew that his wife made a cup of tea at 9pm; a light bulb had been removed in the basement. Lucan's friend Greville Howard later told police Lucan had told him that killing his wife would save him from bankruptcy, because he would reclaim his house, and that he could dump her body in the Solent; she \"would never be found\".  What happened to Lucan? Initially police believed he had fled to Africa. Some speculated that the peer's wealthy friends, dubbed \"the Clermont set\", had helped spirit him away, and perhaps killed him because he had become an embarrassment, or at least encouraged him to shoot himself before his body was fed to tigers owned by John Aspinall at Howletts, his private zoo in Kent.  There have been 'sightings' of the missing peer as far away as India, Mozambique and Australia. The most plausible theory remains that he committed suicide shortly after the nanny's death. Lady Lucan believed that he took a ferry from Newhaven and threw himself into the Channel. In 2016, his son George Bingham said he believed his father had been dead since 1974, and that it was time to find \"another Loch Ness monster out there\".  Why are people still fascinated by the case?  There has been a real human cost in this case and tragically people often forget that Sandra Rivett is the real victim  The BBC is to air a documentary series looking to solve the mysterious disappearance of Lord Lucan following the murder of his children’s nanny Sandra Rivett almost 50 years ago. The three-part series follows Ms Rivett’s son, Hampshire  builder Neil Berriman, who has been consumed by the case since he discovered his mother’s identity at the age of 40, having been put for adoption as a baby.In 2016, Lord Lucan’s son Lord George Bingham inherited his title as the eighth Earl after he applied for a death certificate 42 years after his father vanished, under the Presumption of Death Act, which came into effect in 2014. Lady Lucan was estranged from her children and lived as a recluse, before killing herself in 2017.\n",

      "Former One Direction star Liam Payne died after falling from the third floor of a hotel in Argentina in a tragic incident that has shocked the music world and left fans devastated.\n",
      "Here's what is known so far about the star's tragic death at the age of just 31 Why was he in Argentina? Liam arrived in Argentina - staying at the Casa Sur hotel with his girlfriend, Kate Cassidy - two weeks before his death. He was there to support his former bandmate Niall Horan, who was performing there.  Whilst leaving Niall's concert, Liam posted a video on snapchat story saying he wanted to reunite with Niall: “It’s been a while since me and Niall have spoken,” he said. “I would like to square up a couple things with the boy. No bad vibes or nothing like that but just — but we need to talk.” Liam's girlfriend left Argentina two days before his death to return to the U.S, stating on TikTok: “We were supposed to be there for like five days, turned into two weeks, and I was just like, I need to go home.” In the days leading up to his death, it was reported that his ex, Maya Henry, had filed a cease-and-desist order against Payne, alleging he had repeatedly contacted her. She took to TikTok and claimed that an unnamed ex of hers would not leave her or her mother alone and was sending calls, emails and texts - even to her mother - from different phone numbers and iCloud accounts. She asked: “Is that normal behaviour to you?\" Liam posted early on October 16 in his now-deleted Snapchat stories, showing  him enjoying breakfast with his girlfriend Cassidy, saying he was having “a lovely day in Argentina.” Although it was unclear when exactly the video was taken as Cassidy left two days before that. What happened on the day he died? Later on the Wednesday, police received a call from a hotel employee stating Payne was acting \"aggressively\". They said they believed his life may be at risk. According to Reuters an employee said “He is destroying the entire room and we need you to send someone” and they believed he was at risk because of the balcony in his room. At around 5pm on Wednesday a man staying next door to Payne reported hearing a \"violent, manly scream\" before his death. Alberto Crescenti, head of the state emergency medical system, said Payne succumbed to injuries suffered in the fall, with no chance of resuscitation. A spokesperson for the Security Ministry of Buenos Aires municipality shared that Payne “had thrown himself from the balcony of his room.” Police found his body in the hotel courtyard, the spokesperson said. What was the official cause of death? Payne’s body was taken to a morgue where doctors performed an autopsy hours after his death.  The National Criminal and Correctional Prosecutor’s Office of Argentina have said in a statement on Thursday that it is being treated as “doubtful death.” The Argentine official shared that a preliminary autopsy found that he died from a skull fracture and multiple trauma as well as internal and external bleeding. Forensic experts found no evidence of defensive injuries or foul play.  The prosecutor’s office found from the position of Payne’s body and the injuries sustained that he “did not adopt a reflexive posture to protect himself and that he may have fallen in a state of semi- or total unconsciousness.” Officials said Payne appeared to have been alone when he fell. Local police who examined his hotel room found “various destroyed objects and furniture,” and a smashed TV screen. Tributes have been flooding in after Payne's tragic death. Niall Horan saw Payne shortly before his death \"I feel so fortunate that I got to see him recently,\" he shared. \"I sadly didn't know that after saying goodbye and hugging him that evening, I would be saying goodbye forever. It's heartbreaking.\" Adding he was \"absolutely devastated\" by Payne's death. Payne's family have also shared their tribute with PA stating: \"We are heartbroken. Liam will forever live in our hearts and we’ll remember him for his kind, funny and brave soul.\" They added \"We are supporting each other the best we can as a family and ask for privacy and space at this awful time.\" Simon Cowell who signed Payne to his record label with One Direction has shared he is 'gutted', with an insider stating that he cherished him like his own flesh and blood. Cowell has cancelled the Britains Got Talent auditions as a mark of respect.\n",

      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting has announced that obese unemployed people will be given weight-loss injections to help them get back into work - but what's the difference between Ozempic and Mounjaro and what are the effects?\n",
      "Mr Streeting said that sickness caused by obesity was \"holding back our economy\", as he unveiled a £279 million investment from the world's biggest pharmaceutical company. He said that the commitment by Lilly - the world's largest pharmaceutical company - would include the first real-world trial of the effect of weight-loss jabs on unemployment rates, productivity and reliance on healthcare. As many as 3,000 obese patients, including a mixture of people with and without jobs, as well as some on sick leave, will take part in a five-year study to investigate if the jabs increase productivity and bring people back to work. Ozempic and Mounjaro are both prescriptions given by weekly injection to help manage blood sugar and weight in adults - here is what they are and their effects explained.

It belongs to a group of drugs called GLP-1 agonists. The drug is also sold under the brand names Wegovy and Rybelsus. Whereas Ozempic and Rybelsus are only licensed as a medicine for diabetes, Wegovy has been created specifically for supporting weight loss, according to Boots. Ozempic reduces the amount of glucose produced by the liver and slows down how quickly food is digested. It can help regulate appetite and keep you feeling fuller for longer. It also increases the levels of incretins – hormones – produced by the stomach while eating, according to Diabetes UK. Mounjaro is the brand name for a drug called tirzepatide.\t Similarly to Ozempic, it is used to help those with Type 2 diabetes manage blood sugar levels as well as helping with weight loss. It works by activating two receptors called GLP-1 and GIP to increase hormone levels in the body, according to Diabetes UK. Mounjaro has been hailed as the \"King Kong\" of weight-loss jabs. It helps to reduce appetite and curb cravings. A previous study found people taking the drug, along with support to make changes to exercise and diet, lost an average of 21% of their bodyweight over a 36-week period. NHS officials have suggested that the roll-out of the drug across England will need to be staggered due to anticipated high levels of demand.  \t Nearly a quarter-of-a-million people are expected to receive the Mounjaro jab over the next three years.\n",

      "The budget will reveal the government's spending plans for the upcoming year. As the first budget under a new government, Rachel Reeves' plans will also give more insight into what the economy will look like under Labour. Chancellor Rachel Reeves has warned of “tough decisions” at the spending review as Labour says it needs to plug a £22 billion “black hole” in the public finances left by the Conservatives. The Prime Minister has said the Budget will focus on boosting living standards, reviving the NHS and “rebuilding Britain”, signalling investment in schools, housing and transport After Prime Minister’s questions at midday the Chancellor will stand up to deliver the budget.  She will set out plans for taxes, and commitments for public services like health, schools and the police. Alongside the budget, the Treasury publishes its own report setting out full details of the spending plans. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) also assesses the plans, with their findings released shortly afterwards. The Conservative leader will then have a chance to respond to the Chancellor’s statement. The budget speech normally starts at about 12.30pm and lasts around an hour.

      "Florida residents are preparing for Hurricane Milton to make landfall on Wednesday evening - here's everything you need to know.\n",
      "The storm is barrelling towards the coast of western Florida with winds reaching up to 165mph - making it a strong Category 5 hurricane - the highest category. People living in Milton's path have been urged to move away, with authorities warning that they are likely to die if they stay in place. Streets of cities in the path of the hurricane have emptied, airports have closed, and even the famous theme parks have closed. Joe Biden said: \"It's a matter of life and death, and that's not hyperbole.\" It comes just two weeks after Hurricane Helene devastated large swaths of the country including Florida, killing around 200. Read more: LIVE: Millions of people scramble to flee Florida as ‘unsurvivable’ hurricane Milton due to hit coastline in hours Read more: All UK flights to Florida cancelled and theme parks closed as Hurricane Milton races towards land Milton is set to make landfall in Florida on Wednesday at 2pm local time at the earliest - 7pm UK time. This timing is inexact and subject to change, as the storm's speed changes over time. But Milton is set to arrive by early Thursday local time at the latest. Milton is set to hit the central Florida coast, although the exact location is unclear at the moment. The centre of the storm could hit the city of Tampa, where around 400,000 people live. Many more live in the surrounding area. There is also a possibility the main brunt of the storm could be borne further south in Fort Myers, which is over 100 miles away. Curfews have also been brought in in some areas. Serious impacts from the storm could also be felt in Orlando and Daytona Beach, further east. Everyone has been urged to leave the area because of the deadly impact of the storm. More than a million people are under evacuation orders, but efforts to get away have been hampered by huge traffic jam and petrol shortages. Tampa mayor Jane Castor said: \"This is literally catastrophic, and I can say without any dramatisation whatsoever: If you choose to stay in one of those evacuation areas, you’re going to die.\" Milton is still a Category 5 storm with wind speeds reaching 165mph as of Wednesday morning.  As well as the damage from the wind, Milton is also set to bring 15-foot storm surges and flooding - potentially catastrophic in the low-lying Tampa area. Milton could cause damage of as much as $175 billion (£134 billion), according to preliminary estimates of a worst-case scenario. A lower estimate comes to around $50 billion (£38 billion). “While too early to make insured loss estimates, a major hurricane impact in one of Florida’s most heavily populated regions could result in mid-double-digit billion dollar loss,” a note from financial services company Jefferies said. The costs are hard to estimate, in part because it's still unclear where Hurricane Milton will land. If the centre of the storm makes landfall in the heavily built up Tampa Bay area, costs will be higher. If it comes ashore further south in the Fort Myers city, costs could be lower. The area is already reeling from Hurricane Helene, which left damages of around $11 billion (£8 billion). Storm Ian, which hit two years ago, caused damages of around $50 billion - and analysts think Milton could be significantly worse than that. All flights to Florida from the UK have been cancelled, with most airports shut. Disney World and Universal Orlando World have closed their parks until at least tomorrow. Airlines including TUI, British Airways and Virgin Atlantic have been forced to cancel services.\n",

      "Autumn is well and truly here, with frequent rain downpours and chilly weather - and the evenings are set to get even darker.\n",
      "The clocks are set to go back soon, meaning that Brits will have less afternoon and evening daylight. This is a trade-off so that there is more light in the mornings, as people go to work and children go to school. The yearly change means that the UK will be in Greenwich Mean Time again, after several months in British Summer Time. But it's not all bad - the clocks going back mean that everyone will get an extra hour in bed.

Any device in your home connected to the internet, such as smartphones, laptops, tablets and TVs will automatically change. However, alarm clocks, car radios and other devices may need to be changed manually. A helpful phrase to remember is “spring forward, fall back” to know whether the clocks are going forward or back. The change was introduced to make the most of daylight, both in the summer and winter. It was brought in in 1916, following a campaign by the builder William Willett. The idea is that anyone working in a 9-5 job will arrive at work in daytime. Some people are against the change away from British Summer Time on lifestyle grounds, because they value more light in the evenings. People often complain when the change first happens that it makes evenings too dark and gloomy, despite the extra hour of daylight in the mornings. But some studies have suggested that the clocks going back could have real mental health consequences, such as a possible link to seasonal depression. Other studies purport to show a connection between both sets of time changes and physical health problems, caused by sleep disruption. Despite the opposition in some quarters, the government has no plans to change the current system. In 2025 the clocks will go forward again by an hour on Sunday March 30. \n",

      "Iran has launched nearly 200 missiles into Israel tonight, with the order coming from the country's supreme leader, Ali Khamenei.\n",
      "Iran claims 80% of missiles hit their targets, but the Israeli Defence Forces said they are \"not aware\" of any injuries after employing its famous Iron Dome defence system to shoot down missiles. The Iron dome is Israel's highly prized air defence system that is used when the country faces aerial attacks. The system, which was developed by Israel's state-owned Rafael Advanced Defence Systems with US support, uses radars to detect and intercept rockets, missiles and drones. It is made up of a series of mobile units placed throughout the country and when their radars detect a threat, the information is sent to a \"battle management centre\". Here, military personnel analyse the threat's path and impact point to make a decision on which missile launcher to use to intercept it. Counter missiles are then fired directly at the threat - or near it - so the shrapnel can neutralise it. The dome, which is manned 24 hours a day, reacts within a matter of seconds and was designed to protect against missiles with a range of 2.5 to 43 miles, though it is thought to have been expanded. It has blocked more than 90% of rockets fired towards Israel, which is why the number of Israeli deaths in the ongoing conflict has remained low, while those in Gaza continue to increase. Iran's attack on 13 April saw 170 drones, 120 ballistic missiles and 30 cruise missiles used, \"99%\" of which were intercepted by the Iron Dome, according to Israel Defence Forces data.

But what is a ballistic missile and were they used in Tuesday's strike?  A ballistic missile is a rocket-powered missile that can move across more than 5,500 kilometres of area if fired at \"intercontental range\".  The rockets can also be fired at medium-range (1,000–3,000 kilometres), intermediate-range (3,000–5,500 kilometres). They are often used to carry out strategic long-range attacks, shot at a high arc trajectory towards their target, but are unpowered and unguided during their descent.  According to the Missile Defence Advocacy Alliance, a short range ballistic missile could create an explosive damage radius of up to 1.06km, and see more than 77,000 casualties in an urban centre. Patrick Senft, a research coordinator at the intelligence consultancy firm Armament Research Services (ARES), has told the BBC that fragments suggested that ballistic missiles had been used in the attack. He said ballistic missiles “make up the majority of the Iranian long-range strike capabilities\". Dr Thomas Karako, the director of the Missile Defense Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), is also confident that ballistic missiles were used. His colleague, Mark Cancian, a senior adviser at CSIS says that the difference between today’s attack compared with Iran's attack in April is that “more missiles seem to be hitting Israel”. He adds that ballistic missiles are harder to intercept by missile defence systems “because of their higher speed”. A new type of hypersonic missile was used by Iran for the first time in its attack against Israel this evening, according to the country's revolutionary guard.  The IRGC said its \"Fattah\" missile, created and manufactured by Tehran and unveiled only last year, was part of the barrage that rained down on Israeli cities.  The name of the missile translates to \"conqueror\" or \"bringer of victory\" in Arabic.\n",

      "The exploding pagers injured around 3,000 people across Lebanon, killing 12 including two children, according to the country's government.  Footage shared on social media showed pagers blowing up in people's pockets in supermarkets. Lebanon blamed Israel, who declined to comment. The two have been trading blows for months against the backdrop of the war in Gaza, and have a history of conflict stretching back decades.  But how did the pagers explode? Read more: Exploding Hezbollah pagers in Lebanon 'made in Europe' amid reports Israel modified devices 'at production level' Read more: Nine people killed and almost 3,000 injured as Hezbollah vows retaliation after pagers explode in Lebanon Hezbollah leaders told operatives - including fighters and medics - earlier this year not to use smartphones because they would be open to cyber attacks from Israel. \"The phone that we have in our hands - I do not have a phone in my hand - is a listening device,\" warned Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah in a speech in February. He later added: \"I tell you that the phone in your hands, in your wife's hands, and in your children's hands is the agent. It is a deadly agent, not a simple one.  \"It is a deadly agent that provides specific and accurate information. Therefore, this requires great seriousness when confronting it.\" Fighters were told to use pagers instead. Pagers work by sending short texts and notifications to users.  They also run on a different wireless network than mobile phones, making them more resilient in emergencies - one of the reasons why many hospitals worldwide still rely on them. But using low-tech communication methods did not make the Hezbollah operatives any safer. The AR-924 pagers were manufactured by Hungarian company BAC Consulting KFT, but bore the branding of Taiwanese company Gold Apollo.  This was authorised, Gold Apollo said. Chairman Hsu Ching-kuang told journalists on Wednesday that his company has had a licensing agreement with BAC for the past three years. Hezbollah ordered the pagers from Gold Apollo earlier this year. Police were seen at the company's offices in Taiwan on Wednesday. The AR-924 pager, advertised as being \"rugged\", contains a rechargeable lithium battery with 85 days of life - crucial in Lebanon where electrical outages are common.  The pagers can receive texts of up to 100 characters.  \t Israel has not commented publicly on the attacks, but it has been widely reported that its intelligence and military were responsible. Hezbollah said that Mossad, the Israeli spy agency, planted explosives inside 5,000 pagers, intervening \"at the production level.\" A Hezbollah source told Reuters that three grams of explosives were hidden inside each of the pagers. They claimed that the pagers were rigged to explode when they received a specific code. Another source told the news agency that \"the Mossad injected a board inside of the device that has explosive material that receives a code.\" They added: \"It's very hard to detect it through any means. Even with any device or scanner.\" Around 3,000 of the 5,000 pagers exploded. Some reports have claimed that Israel planned to detonate the pagers later, but ended up blowing them up early because they were concerned that Hezbollah would soon uncover the plot. Some 2,750 people were injured and 12 people were killed, including two children, according to the Lebanese government.  Lebanon's health minister, Firas Abiad, told journalists during a tour of hospitals on Wednesday morning that many of the wounded suffered \"severe injuries to the eyes\" and others had limbs amputated. At about 3.30pm on Tuesday, as people shopped for food, sat in cafes or drove cars and motorcycles, the pagers in their hands or pockets started heating up and then exploding - leaving blood-splattered scenes and panicking bystanders. It appeared that many of those hit were members of Hezbollah, but it was not immediately clear if non-Hezbollah members also carried any of the exploding pagers. The blasts were mainly in areas where the group has a strong presence, particularly a southern Beirut suburb and in the Beqaa region of eastern Lebanon, as well as in Damascus, according to Lebanese security officials and a Hezbollah official. Lebanon’s health minister, Firass Abiad, said the explosions killed a 10-year-old girl and critically injured 200. “About 2,750 people were injured … more than 200 of them critically,” he said on Tuesday afternoon. A Hezbollah spokesperson said it was the \"biggest security breach yet\". Footage shared on social media showed pagers blowing up in people's pockets, and other images showed wounded victims of the blasts. Iran's ambassador was also said to have been injured in the attack.Hezbollah claimed that the pagers were blown up by Israel, with whom it has been trading blows for months. The UN has branded the alleged attack \"deplorable.\"\n",

      "More than seven years on, a long-awaited report into the deaths of 72 people in the Grenfell Tower fire is being published.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lengthy document - the final report of the inquiry into the 2017 disaster - is expected to lay out in detail its findings around the actions of corporate firms in the construction industry, the local authority, London Fire Brigade and government.  \t Families of those killed have insisted it must be a \"landmark report\" which prompts wide-scale change after what was described as a \"spider's web of blame\" was spun during inquiry hearings. A report in 2019, from the first phase of the inquiry, concluded the tower's cladding did not comply with building regulations and was the \"principal\" reason for the rapid and \"profoundly shocking\" spread of the blaze. Here is a timeline of how the tragedy unfolded on June 14, 2017. LIVE: Grenfell tower report to be published seven years after deadly blaze Read more: Final Grenfell Tower report set to reveal findings seven-years after tragic fire claimed 72 lives A fire broke out in the kitchen of a fourth floor flat just before 1am on June 14, 2017. It began \"in or around\" a Hotpoint fridge-freezer. Within minutes, the fire had spread to all four sides of the building. The fire brigade logged a call at 12.54am, with fire engines arriving at the scene by 12.59am. The first fire crews entered the flat at 1.07am, according to shots from a thermal imaging camera. They searched the bedrooms first and did not enter the kitchen until 1.14am. Once they entered the kitchen, a firefighter described seeing an \"isolated curtain of flame from about 2-3 feet in the air to the ceiling\". Images were taken from outside the building by flat occupant Behailu Kebede, who had called the emergency services. The pictures showed flames surrounding the kitchen window as they continued to \"develop and grow\". They were \"external to the building\" by 1.09am. The approximate timings suggest the fire had reached the cladding before the firefighters made it to the kitchen. The fire quickly spread upwards through the east side of the tower. Video footage showed it reaching the top floor of the east side by 1.26am - less than half an hour after firefighters had arrived on the scene. The tower had a 'stay put' fire policy, with residents told to stay in their flats. By this time, the policy had \"substantially failed\". It resulted in many residents being trapped as the fire continued to grow, while others ignored the advice and made their way out. Some 144 people managed to get out of the building by 1.38am, counsel to the Grenfell inquiry Richard Millet QC told a hearing in 2018. The fire had spread to the north side of the tower by 1.42am, according to fire safety engineer Dr Barbara Lane at the Grenfell Public Inquiry. The fire began to also travel in the other direction - from the eastern side of the tower to the south. The London Fire Brigade declared a \"major incident\" - with 40 fire engines either already at the scene or making their way there. Several internal fires were visible inside the building. The fire spread to the south side of the tower block. The eastern side of the block became \"fully involved in fire\". Stay put advice was finally abandoned and people were advised to \"make efforts to leave the building\". Only 36 people were able to evacuate after the guidance was dropped. Flames engulfed the western side of the block. Around 63 flats were on fire and more than 100 people were trapped in their flats. The whole building was on fire, with more than 100 flats in flames. The blaze finally burnt itself out - more than 24 hours later.\n",

Founded in the 1990s, the company sold its products to big businesses such as Unilever and Barclays, and bought a series smaller companies - until it was bought itself by computing giant Hewlett Packard in 2011. That deal valued the company at about $10 billion. Lynch himself is said to have made about $800 million (£600 million) from the sale, and today he is worth around £500 million.  He had been embroiled in legal troubles related to the sale for much of the previous ten years, and was found not guilty of fraud by a US court in June. Mr Lynch was celebrating being found not guilty with 11 family members, friends, lawyers on the Bayesian yacht, a 56-metre vessel off the coast of Palermo, the capital of the Italian island of Sicily. There were also ten crew members. The yacht was about 300 metres off the coast. It capsized at around 4.30am on Monday, August 19, according to ship tracking data. Local media reported that waterspouts - a rare form of tornado - were seen in the area. The waterspouts likely toppled the ship's 248-foot mast, which was unusually tall. Mr Lynch is among two British people and four Americans who are missing from the yacht. One has yet to be named. The others are: Divers continue to search for the missing people. The ship's chef has died, according to local authorities. Some 15 people have been rescued, including nine crew members.  Among the others are Angela Bacares, who escaped onto a lifeboat. One of the survivors, British woman Charlotte Emsley who works at Mr Lynch's company Invoke Capital and previously was at Autonomy the business at the centre of his legal battle. Ms Emsley told la Repubblica she held her one-year-old daughter, Sofia, to stop her from drowning. She said: \"I held her afloat with all my strength, my arms stretched upwards to keep her from drowning.\"It was all dark. In the water I couldn't keep my eyes open. I screamed for help but all I could hear around me was the screams of others.\" Charlotte and Sofia were treated in hospital, as was Sofia's father, James Emsley. “I held her afloat with all my strength, my arms stretched upwards to keep her from drowning. It was all dark. In the water I couldn’t keep my eyes open. I screamed for help but all I could hear around me was the screams of others.\" Mr Lynch's co-defendant in the US fraud trial, Stephen Chamberlain, died after being hit by a car while out running in Cambridgeshire on Saturday. Mr Chamberlain was the former vice-president of finance at Autonomy. Like Mr Lynch, he had been acquitted in the trial. Gary Lincenberg, Mr Chamberlain's lawyer, said in a statement: \"Our dear client and friend Steve Chamberlain was fatally struck by a car on Saturday while out running \"He was a courageous man with unparalleled integrity. We deeply miss him. \"Steve fought successfully to clear his good name at trial earlier this year, and his good name now lives on through his wonderful family.\" Mr Chamberlain died in hospital after the crash. The driver stopped at the scene. After Hewlett Packard bought Autonomy in 2011, the company said that it had discovered issues with the accounting at the company and declared a multi-million-pound write-down. Hewlett Packard sued Mr Lynch in the UK and in the US. The British court found in favour of the US tech giant in a civil case in 2022, and the judge is still considering the award of damages. Separately, Mr Lynch was extradited to the US in 2023 after a legal battle, and held under house arrest in San Francisco to face fraud charges. The court found him not guilty in June. \n",

      "The Piccadilly Line is set to close this weekend for two weeks, as part of a huge set of improvement works.\n",
      "The news is set to make life harder for tens of thousands of commuters trying to get to and from work. But in the long run the multi-billion pound improvements should make using the line quicker, easier and more efficient. The Piccadilly Line - dark blue on the London Underground map - is among the busiest on the Tube, with around 200 million trips annually before Covid. That accounts for around 10% of all Tube journeys. Here is what you need to know about the closure. Read more: Redesigned circular London Tube map takes internet by storm, as creator says current version is ‘lamentable’ Read more: Commuter chaos as trespasser sees London's train and tube networks grind to a halt at rush hour The northern part of the Piccadilly Line, from Wood Green to final stop Cockfosters, is closing for over two weeks - from 6am this Saturday (August 17) until the morning of Sunday September 1. As well as this, from 12.30-6.00 on August 17 there will be no trains for a longer stretch of the line, between King's Cross and Cockfosters. During the two-week period, the following stations will have no Tube service: Cockfosters, Oakwood, Southgate, Arnos Grove, Bounds Green. There will also be no service or fewer trains on other parts of the line during this period. No trains will run between Rayners Lane and Uxbridge in west London, and trains will run less often between Wood Green and Acton Town (via central London) as well as to Heathrow Terminal 4. There will also be several weekend closures on the line, although dates and stations affected have not been specified yet. There are rail replacement buses running between Wood Green and Cockfosters, stopping at every station, but these are likely to be very busy. Otherwise, Transport for London (TfL) said people should find other train stations nearby. The Piccadilly Line is closing to prepare it for a new set of 94 Siemens trains, replacing the 86 currently in operation, which date to 1973. These new trains will be the first of the deep-line trains to have air conditioning, and will also have walk-through carriages such as on the Elizabeth Line and several others. Other improvements that will come with the new trains include wider double doors, digital display screens, better step-free access and more CCTV. The new trains should be running from 2025. In theory, yes. TfL have said that the greater number of trains in service will let them run a Piccadilly Line train every two minutes and five seconds on average. That's 27 trains an hour, compared to the previous 24. TfL said this would increase passenger capacity by up to 23% at peak times. They also said the new trains would be 20% more energy-efficient. TfL is also improving its power system across the line. Most of the trains are being built at Siemens' factory in the East Riding of Yorkshire, which TfL said had created about 1,000 skilled job opportunities. TfL are building new facilities at Cockfosters, Northfields and South Harrow, to keep and maintain the new trains. The transport agency also said they would improve accessibility by installing platform humps or manual boarding ramps, and adjusting platform edges and track positions to make it easier for people to get on and off trains. TfL said that to get the most out of the new trains, they need to upgrade signalling on the line. They also want to add another 18 Siemens trains, taking the total to 112. They said these further improvements would allow them to run up to 36 trains an hour in the central London during peak hours, which would represent a 64% increase in capacity on current levels. But this depends on whether TfL can get enough money from the government, which they haven't been given yet.\n",

      "Stargazers are in for a treat on Monday night as the Delta Aquariid meteors sail over the night skies.\n",
      "The Delta Aquariid meteor shower runs annually for around six weeks between the middle of July and the end of August. The meteor shower is set to reach its peak tonight, and is expected to be at its most spectacular from around midnight until around the early hours of Tuesday morning. They will be best viewed without binoculars or a telescope, according to experts - so you can see a wider stretch of the sky. You should also switch off any outdoor lights. Conditions are good for stargazing for this year's Delta Aquariid showers, as it is taking place a few days before a full moon. Read more: Perseid meteor shower to light up UK sky tonight - here's what you need to know Read more: Stunning footage shows meteor streaking over British skies A Met Office spokesperson said: \"We are expecting clear skies over England and Wales tonight and tomorrow night.  \"However there will be varying amounts of cloud over Scotland, Northern Ireland and parts of north east England at times.\" The Delta Aquariid marks the start of the summer meteor season in the Northern Hemisphere. The meteors take their name from the Aquarius constellation in the night sky that they seem to shine out, near Delta Aquarii, a particularly bright star Delta Aquarii. Experts are still not totally sure which comet is responsible for producing the Delta Aquariid meteor shower.  Most recently, scientists identified a comet called Comet 96P/Machholz as the most likely source. A meteor shower is produced as the Sun heats up small bits of loose rock and dust. Comet 96P/Machholz gets its name from Donald Machholz, who discovered it in 1986. It is believed to have an estimated diameter of four miles (6.4 kilometres). It takes just over five years to complete one orbit around the Sun. Dr Greg Brown, astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich, told MailOnline: \"Delta Aquariids and the Alpha Capricornids are two meteor showers that peak on the nights of the 29th and 30th of July respectively. \"The Delta Aquariids has a decent ideal rate of around 25 meteors per hour, while the Alpha Capricornids is a fairly weak shower of around 5 meteors per hour, though light pollution and other viewing conditions will likely reduce the actual observed rate.\"\n",

      "With US President Joe Biden ending his re-election bid and endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris, Democrats must now navigate an unprecedented shift that has never previously happened in US politics.\n",
      "Democrats are set to hold their convention in Chicago on August 19-22. What was supposed to be a coronation for Mr Biden now becomes an open contest in which nearly 4,700 delegates will be responsible for picking a new standard-bearer to challenge Republican Donald Trump in the autumn. The path ahead is neither easy nor obvious, even with Mr Biden endorsing Ms Harris. There are unanswered questions about logistics, money and political fallout. - Can Mr Biden redirect his delegates? Mr Biden won every state primary and caucus earlier this year and lost only the territory of American Samoa. At least 3,896 delegates had been pledged to support him. Current party rules do not permit Mr Biden to pass them to another candidate. Politically, though, his endorsement is likely to be influential. - What are Kamala Harris' credentials?  Born in Oakland, California, Kamala Harris is the daughter of immigrants and has previously commented on how she and her sister, Maya, looked up to their mother, Shyamala Gopalan - a breast cancer scientist. In 1990, she joined the Alameda County District Attorney’s Office where she specialized in prosecuting child sexual assault cases. In 2004, Ms Harris was elected District Attorney of San Francisco where she was a national leader in the movement for LGBTQ+ rights, before being elected Attorney General of California in 2010 where she oversaw the largest state justice department in the US. Read More: Joe Biden quits 2024 US presidential race and endorses Kamala Harris - as Trump labels him 'unfit to serve' Read More: Joe Biden quits 2024 US election LIVE: President Biden backs VP Kamala Harris as Trump hits out at 'unfit' leader - What could happen at the convention? With Mr Biden stepping aside, Democrats technically start with an open convention. But realistically, his endorsement pushes Democrats into murky territory. The immediate burden is on Ms Harris to solidify support across almost 4,000 delegates from the states, territories and District of Columbia, plus more than 700 so-called superdelegates that include party leaders, certain elected officials and former presidents and vice presidents.  - Will anyone challenge Kamala Harris? Even before Mr Biden announced his decision, Democrats floated California governor Gavin Newsom and Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer as potential contenders in addition to Ms Harris. Yet some Democrats argued publicly, and many privately, that it would be a no-brainer to elevate the first woman, first black woman and first person of south Asian descent to hold national office. Given how important black voters - and black women especially - were to Mr Biden's nomination and his choice of Ms Harris as running mate, it would be risky, to say the least, for Democrats to pass her over for a white nominee. Democrats already faced historical headwinds before Mr Biden's withdrawal. Mr Newsom and Ms Whitmer, both of whom are white, and any other Democrat would also have to weigh the short-term and long-term benefits of challenging Ms Harris now versus preserving goodwill for a future presidential primary. Yet, fair or not, Ms Harris also has not been viewed as an especially beloved or empowered vice president. The best scenario for her and Democrats is to quickly shore up support and project a united front. Democrats could even go forward with their plans for an early virtual vote - a move they'd planned to make sure Mr Biden was selected ahead of Ohio's general election ballot deadline. - What happens to Biden's campaign money? Biden's campaign recently reported 91 million dollars (£70 million) cash on hand. Allied Democratic campaign committees brought the total at his disposal to more than 240 million dollars (£186 million). Campaign finance experts agree generally that Ms Harris could control all those funds since the campaign was set up in her name as well as Mr Biden's. If Democrats do nominate someone other than Ms Harris, party accounts could still benefit the nominee, but the Biden-Harris account would have more restrictions. For example, legal experts say it could become an independent expenditure political action committee but not simply transfer its balance to a different nominee.  - How will a vice presidential nomination work?  The vice presidential nomination is always a separate convention vote. In routine years, the convention ratifies the choice of the nominee. If Ms Harris closes ranks quickly, she could name her choice and have the delegates ratify it. In an extended fight, though, the vice presidency could become part of horse-trading - again, a return to conventions of an earlier era.  - Can Republicans keep Ms Harris off state ballots?  Any curveball during a US presidential campaign is certain to produce a flurry of state and federal lawsuits in this hyper-partisan era, and some conservatives have threatened just that.  State laws, though, typically do not prescribe how parties choose their nominees for president. And some Republican figures - Ohio governor Mike DeWine and Alabama governor Kay Ivey - have worked already this year to ensure their party did not deny Democrats' routine ballot access.\n",

      "A huge IT outage has unleashed chaos across the world, grounding planes, halting trains and leaving GP surgeries unable to take bookings - but what caused this massive failure?\n",
      "The specific cause of the global IT failure relates to an update implemented on Windows devices by cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike.  Some companies have the software, others don’t. This explains why you may be able to pop into Greggs and buy your coffee, but be unable to hop on the train to work. LBC explains what and who is to blame for the global outage and what is affected so far. Global IT outage LIVE: Crowdstrike outage could be 'biggest cyber incident ever' CrowdStrike, founded in 2011, is a cybersecurity company that protects organisation against cyber threats. It uses a cloud-based system that offers companies security over the internet, rather with local installations. It provides companies with real-time insights into security threats and usually raises the alarm when something looks wrong. This allows companies to carry out quick responses to any potential cyber attacks. CrowdStrike’s endpoint detection and response (EDR) is used by companies worldwide, including banks, plane companies, and broadcasters, which explains why its failure has caused such widespread chaos. The mass IT outage being felt across the world was caused by an update implemented by CrowdStrike. The ‘buggy’ software update subsequently caused Windows services to crash. CrowdStrike president George Kurtz said the problem was caused by a “defect found in a single content update for Windows hosts”.     He said: “This is not a security incident or cyber attack. The issue has been identified, isolated and a fix has been deployed.  “We refer customers to the support portal for the latest updates and will continue to provide complete and continuous updates on our website.    “We further recommend organisations ensure they're communicating with CrowdStrike representatives through official channels.    “Our team is fully mobilised to ensure the security and stability of CrowdStrike customers.”  Mr Kurtz said the issue was not affecting Mac or Linux software, but tech experts believe it may be the biggest global IT outage in history.  Everything from planes, trains and banks to broadcasters, supermarkets and GP surgeries.  Airports across the world, including London Luton and London Gatwick, have seen their systems go down, meaning passengers are being processed manually.  Trains, including the Gatwick Express, are also struggling due to the outage.  Most GP surgeries across the country are unable to make bookings, while pharmacies are also struggling.  Of course, people with Windows computers are likely to be facing problems, with millions being confronted with the so-called 'Blue Screen of Death'.  This occurs when a Windows operating system crashes, leaving users unable to use their computer.  It is not just the UK that has been affected, but the United States, Australia, Japan, New Zealand, France, and Germany. \n",

      "Labour's legislative agenda has been unveiled in the King's first speech under the new Government, covering everything from the economy and planning reform to crime and immigration. \n",
      "A total of 40 bills have been unveiled, 35 of which are new, with some older draft laws carried over from the last Government.  The economy is at the front and centre of the King's Speech, with the Prime Minister, Sir Keir Starmer, vowing to ’turbo charge’ economic growth and ‘take the brakes off Britain’. Budget responsibility Bill  The Government has vowed to introduce a 'fiscal lock' make sure every economic decision is “consistent with its fiscal rules”. The King said: “It will legislate to ensure that all significant tax and spending changes are subject to an independent assessment by the Office for Budget Responsibility.” Labour say this will avoid future budgets like the one introduced by Liz Truss, which was not subject to an OBR forecast.  Employment Rights Bill The Government has pledged to 'make work pay' with its 'new deal for working people', which it says will ban 'exploitative practices' and 'enhance' employment rights. This includes delivering a new living wage, banning zero-hour contracts and 'fire and rehire', and removing the lower earnings limit of statutory sick pay.  Employers will also have to make flexible working the 'default', while minimum service levels - as brought in by the Conservative government - will be removed.  National Wealth Funds Bill  The National Wealth Fund, which Labour says can begin immediately, will aim to generate £3 of private sector investment for every £1 it invests. English Devolution Bill  Labour have bemoaned how England is one of the most \"centralised\" economies in Europe, so it has vowed to increase devolution across the nation - not just the UK.  The Bill will aim to give local leaders more powers - including mayors and councillors - over planning, transport, skills and employment.  Local communities will also be given a new 'right to buy' community assets, including empty shops and pubs, in a bid to revamp Britain's struggling high streets.  Also central to the Government's bid to 'turbo charge' the economy is an ambitious plan to overhaul the planning system.  Planning and Infrastructure Bill “My Ministers will get Britain building, including through planning reform, as they seek to accelerate the delivery of high quality infrastructure and housing,” the King said in his speech. The Government has vowed to back the planning system an 'enabler of growth', rather than a 'major brake'.  This Bill will aim to upgrade the national grid in order to improve renewable energy and nationalise some planning decisions. It comes after the Government pledged to build 1.5 million homes across the country.  Renters’ Rights Bill This Bill vows to abolish Section 21, also known as 'no fault evictions'.  Tenants will also be given powers to challenge rent increases, while the government will also introduce new laws to end rental bidding practices.  Landlords will also not be allowed 'unreasonably' refuse tenants who wish to have a pet in their property.  There will also be a new ombudsman service for the private rented sector.  There are just two health bills in the King's Speech: a Mental Health Bill and Rishi Sunak’s Tobacco and Vapes Bill.  Wes Streeting has described the NHS as ‘broken’ and stressed the need for reform, yet the King Speech is notably vague on how this may unfold.  There is just one mention of the National Health Service by King Charles in his speech, and no mentions by Starmer in his introduction.  One of the bills resurrected from the last government is Mr Sunak's smoking bill. It will mean anyone born after 1 January 2009 will not be allowed to buy cigarettes. It will also ban vape branding designed to appeal to children.  Passenger Railway Services (Public Ownership) Bill As was outlined in Labour's manifesto, the Government will renationalise the railways.  However, there will be no reversal of the last Government's cancellation of HS2 between Manchester and London.  But the Bill will redirect cash to improve west-east rail services in the north of England. Better Buses Bill As well as the trains, the Labour Government has pledged to reform the bus system across the country. The Bill will remove the ban on publicly-owned bus companies and give more powers to local leaders to control their bus systems. Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill  The Government has pledged to end small boat crossings by launching a new 'Border Security Command', which it says creates new powers to tackle smuggling gangs.  The Government will also introduce stronger penalties for those convicted of border crimes.  Crime and Policing Bill This Bill will aim to give police more powers to deal with anti-social behaviour, as well as increasing the number of neighbourhood police officers.  There are also pledges to tackle retail crime by creating a new offence for assaults on shopworkers.  Great British Energy  As was promised in Labour's manifesto, the Government has vowed to set up Great British Energy, a publicly-owned energy company.  This will oversee and operate clean power projects across the country, says the government.  Water (Special Measures) Bill This Bill will put water companies under special measures and make sure bosses face personal criminal liability for lawbreaking The water regulator Ofwat will also be given new powers to ban the payment of bonuses where environmental standards are not met.  House of Lords (Hereditary Peers) Bill This Bill will aim to reform the House of Lords, including by removing reserved places for individuals born into certain families. There was no mention of introducing an age limit of 80, which may come in future years.   Football Governance Bill This Bill will establish an independent football regulator, another bill carried over from the last Government.  There will also be new financial regulation to help clubs across the football pyramid and a new owners' and directors' test.  Clubs will also be banned from joining breakaway leagues, such as the previously-proposed European Super League.  Holocaust Memorial Bill The Holocaust Memorial Bill will allow the Government to build the planned Holocaust Memorial and Learning Centre.  Hillsborough Law A new duty of candour for public servants will be introduced, meaning professionals must tell the person when something has gone wrong, apologise and offer an appropriate remedy.  Northern Ireland Legacy Act Labour say the Legacy Act 'denies justice to the families and victims of the Troubles' and pledged to replace it with a new law.  Terrorism (Protection of Premises) Bill, aka Martyn's Law This Bill will aim to improve the safety of public venues, keeping the public safe from terrorism.  The law is inspired by Martyn Hett, who was killed in the Manchester Arena attack in 2017.  Draft Conversion Practices Bill The draft Conversion Practices Bill will propose new offences to target acts of conversion practices not covered by current laws.\n",

      "Meghan Markle’s has encountered a fresh setback during a rebranding of her brand American Riviera Orchard - following accusations of plagiarism in Spain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Officials in the Spanish village of Porreres on the island of Mallorca are reportedly considering legal action against the Duchess of Sussex after alleging she copied the town’s traditional coat of arms for the logo of her newly relaunched luxury brand named As Ever. The two images bear a striking resemblance, both featuring a single palm tree flanked by two tropical looking birds.  The Porreres’ coat of arms is vibrant, with orange and green for the tree, black for the birds, and set against a white background. In contrast, Meghan’s logo uses a more muted white and blue colour scheme. Mayor Francisca Mora told the local newspaper, Ara Balears, the similarity was \"surreal\" and the town hall is currently considering legal action. She remarked, “I don’t know if she visited agritourism sites and came across the coat of arms, because the image on her website appears to be from Mallorca.” Mayor Mora noted that the village now \"feels international\" and hopes this incident will at least raise its profile. “I hope many people around the world will become aware that in Mallorca, there is an inland town with this coat of arms,” she added.

An image from the rebrand shows Meghan running across some grass with her daughter Lilibet as palm trees sway in the background.\n",

      "Meghan has taken to Instagram to reveal that her brand will now be called As Ever - and its launch will tie in with the release of her Netflix series With Love, Meghan, which drops on the streaming platform in two weeks.  A new website for As Ever has also been launched featuring a picture of Meghan running hand-in-hand with daughter Princess Lilibet. Read More: Meghan's four-word response as Prince Harry receives standing ovation in emotional Invictus Games closing ceremony Read More: Harry and Meghan share sweet Valentine's photo after William and Kate also post romantic picture The clip - shot in what appears to be her and Prince Harry's garden at their mansion in Montecito, California  - begins with the duke playfully saying: \"It's recording.\" Meghan - wearing a loose fitting white shirt and jeans - giggles before adding: \"Cat's out of the bag. I'm shocked we've kept this secret for so long.\" The new As Ever website features a photo of their daughter Lilibet who is rarely seen publicly. Meghan promised fans she will still be selling jams, saying \"my jam is my jam\", but As Ever opens up more opportunities and is tied to her upcoming Netflix show With Love, Meghan. The Duchess is no stranger to sharing lifestyle tips as she previously ran the successful blog The Tig, which she closed down just before marrying Harry.   In a subtle dig at the royals after previously saying she wasn't allowed to do certain things when she was a member of the Firm, she added: \"I've always loved cooking, crafting and gardening. This is what I do and I haven't been able to share it with you in the same way for the past few years but now I can.\" Meghan had suffered a series of setbacks when it comes to trademarking the name American Riviera Orchard, which could explain the switch to As Ever. She has been told by officials she can't have exclusive rights to ‘American Riviera’ because it is a commonly used place name to describe the California coast. Further hitches included Meghan and her team filling in the official forms incorrectly, and failing to send enough cash. The new website, similar to American Riviera Orchard, also features a place for people to subscribe for updates and features the slogan 'Save Your Seat At The Table'. The logo shows a palm tree with two hummingbirds.  According to a patent application for the As Ever, which was made in 2022, it suggests it will sell items such as tablecloths and napkins as well as candles, spreads and jewelery.\n",

Her Shaping Us project, published through the Princess’ Royal Foundation Centre for Early Childhood, offers a framework for teaching 30 skills during a child’s development, from pregnancy to the age of five. Upon the launch, Kate said: “Modern society is complex. At times, it can feel like the world is filled with mistrust and misunderstanding, leaving many people feeling isolated and vulnerable during difficult times. “The impact of this, poor mental health, addiction and abuse, can be devastating, for individuals and for society.“If we are to address this properly, if we are to find real, lasting solutions to these deep-rooted challenges and create a physically and mentally healthier society, we must reset, restore, and rebalance. We must invest in humankind.”\n",

In the closing ceremony, he used his speech to say the world was still \"full of strife and trauma\". He said he wanted to honour not only those at the games but \"comrades, friends of loved ones lost to battle or to suicide\". The Invictus community is making the world a better place, Harry added. \"You might swear allegiance to different flags, but you stand united in your decency, your compassion and your spirit of service,\" he said. \"I can't stand before you and promise there won't be challenging times ahead. But I promise you, you're better equipped now than you ever were before.\" He ended his speech saying: \"Bring on Invictus Birmingham 2027.\" The event was held at the Rogers Stadium in Vancouver, with 20,000 people in attendance.\n",

      "The Princess of Wales has 'put her foot down' to stop her three children from taking part in a traditional 'blooding' ritual.\n",
      "According to a new book - \"Yes Ma'am - The Secret Life of Royal Servants\" by Tom Quinn - the princess was adamant they do not take part. The ancient ritual is the practice having blood smeared on your face after your first kill while hunting - usually a fox or stag. In an extract obtained by FEMAIL, the author writes: \"Charles's daughter in-law, Catherine, Princess of Wales, has put her foot down and insisted there will be no blooding for her children.\" The source reported that the King has completed the tradition, as has Prince William and Prince Harry. Read More: Conclave wins Best Film at BAFTAs as Adrien Brody named Best Actor Read More: Harry and Meghan share sweet Valentine's photo after William and Kate also post romantic pictureI In his book Spare, the Duke of Sussex described his experience, as his hunting guide Sandy bled a stag from its neck on the grounds of Balmoral. He wrote: \"He placed a hand gently behind my neck, and… pushed my head inside the carcass \"I tried to pull away, but Sandy pushed me deeper. I was shocked by his insane strength. And by the infernal smell. My breakfast jumped up from my stomach. \"After a minute I couldn't smell anything, because I couldn't breathe. My nose and mouth were full of blood, guts and a deep, upsetting warmth.\" After the release of Spare, animal charity PETA criticised the Prince for his graphic descriptions of the tradition. Harry added it was a 'show of respect for the slain', and 'an act of communion by the slayer'. In another Royal book by Tom Quinn, Gilded Youth, he describes how Prince William is moving away from the bloody traditions around hunting. He said: \"William loves shooting—a love he shares with his father—but he is also conscious that the tide is now moving against what many people now refer to as blood sports (the royals prefer to refer to them as field sports).  \"But are they suitable for George, Charlotte and Louis?\"\n",

      "The academy provides students skills and training with courses in film production, costume, editing and animation. Among the co-founders are David Heyman, producer for all eight of the Harry Potter films, and Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson who oversee the James Bond franchise. William has been the president of the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (Bafta) since 2010, when he succeeded the actor and director Richard Attenborough. On arriving at academy, the prince first had a sit-down discussion with senior representatives from Bafta and the LSA board, where he was told by academy co-founder Tim Bevan that it was \"very much part of the vision that education and industry should come together\".

Year 13 students at the academy were currently working on a collaboration project which transforms the school into a working film set to shoot a short film. This year's film, Melomania, is a futuristic story about four teenage characters living in a world where music has been banned. William asked the model: \"How is it with the studs on? Is it comfortable? You can't really move your eyebrows very much.\" The prince smiled and waved at students taking lessons in their classrooms as he walked around the college. After being taken to the costume department, William spoke to a student displaying their \"steampunk\" outfit about the design process, which he praised as being \"quite cool\". Asked if he would wear the costume personally, the prince added: \"I might do - Saturday night out, why not?\" William then spent time chatting to another student involved in post-production for the project, including adding water digitally into a scene. After being shown the final result, William remarked: \"That's amazing what you can do.\" The prince was then shown to the building's rooftop, where the set for the project was built and students were busy filming a scene. He took up a position on the dolly for one take, keep a keen eye on the camera equipment as the scene played out. The whole set gave a round of applause following the take before posing with William for a group photo. Asked whether he would join the production by a student before he left, William replied: \"I might need a bit of practice.\" Mr Bevan, who is also co-chair of Working Title Films, told the PA news agency: \"I think to get the endorsement of a young royal is sort of fantastic, and it's inspiring for these students. \"It shows the general public that the creative industries are a career that everyone should take seriously [and] that we're good at it.\" Asked how important the college was for young people as a way into the film industry, Mr Bevan said: \"I think you can only tell anecdotally and that we're noticing on productions that more of our alumni are showing up. \"It just feels like it's all beginning to creep out there into the world. We're six years into the school, so we're four years in on our alumni, so it's beginning to work.\" He added: \"To see these different voices, different backgrounds, different faces, different sorts of people coming into the industry, I think it's really important. That way, we will tell better stories.\"\n",

      "Flight Sergeant Zach Stubbings died aged 47 after a decade of battling blood and bone marrow cancer known as multiple myeloma. Helicopter ace and father of three Stubbings was first diagnosed with cancer in 2013 after a thirteen-year career in RAF Search and Rescue. Mr Stubbings trained Prince William when he was stationed at RAF Valley in Anglesey from 2010 to 2013. Former Navy Commander Richard Sutton confirmed the helicopter pilot's death, paying tribute to him as a  \"lively and bubbly guy\" and describing his passing as \"yet another blow\" for his wife Anna-Louise. Read more:  Mr Stubbings previously opened up about inhaling black exhaust fumes from the many helicopters he flew. He told the MailOnline: \"If you're by the cargo door, the exhaust comes right through. \"Even worse, if you're working on the winch, which I was, you're putting your head right out into it. \"We had to clean everything. It didn't feel right. There was no protection, nothing. We all complained about it.\" He would often get \"a face full\" of the toxic fumes, he added. An MoD spokesman said: “Any death is a tragedy and our thoughts are with the family and friends of Zack Stubbins at this difficult time. “We take the health of our personnel extremely seriously and regularly review our processes to ensure that we’re doing what we can to keep our people safe. “We are in the process of testing the exhaust emissions of in-service helicopters, to ensure that we are meeting our duty of care for personnel. \"It is essential that we can assure our people of their safety at work.”\n",

      "Kate was met with shouts and calls for more funding as she visited a women's prison on Tuesday.\n",
      "Kate travelled to HMP Styal, a women's prison in Cheshire, to meet ex-offenders and those still serving who have received support from a mother and baby unit run by the charity Action for Children, which the princess represents as royal patron. She told staff from the unit: \"It is great that you are looking at the mother's wellbeing as well. The best thing for a baby is to have a mother whose emotional needs and wellbeing is met as well.\" The event was Kate's fifth public engagement in just over two weeks as she continues with her gradual return to official duties since completing her cancer treatment. When the royal first arrived, she was met by shouts of \"we need more funding\" and \"tell them the truth\", and also a loud wolf-whistle and cat-calls from women leaning out of accommodation block windows.

She sat down with two former inmates, one woman who left the prison six weeks ago with her toddler son after serving a 14-month sentence for an undisclosed offence and another woman, who was 30 weeks pregnant when she began an 11-month sentence and gave birth to a daughter in prison. The former inmate who has a son told Kate how it was only by being sent to prison that she received \"so much\" help, something that was unlikely to have been available in her local community. The future queen replied: \"It shouldn't have to take something like this to get access to something like this...\" The ex-offender who has a son said: \"I only left six weeks ago and I am just getting rolling with everything again. Thinking about work, nurseries. I have said so many times that I just wish I could take this (prison) nursery and put it in my home town.\" She added: \"It's hands down the best nursery. My son just ran up to the nursery worker straight away and recognised her just now.\" When Kate chatted with staff from the mother and baby unit, she asked about its effects on reoffending, suggesting it was \"massive\", and was told normal reoffending rates for women were around 70% but this reduced to just 12% with those receiving parental support. During Kate's meeting with the former inmates, the ex-offender who has a son said: \"We are both first-time mums and put it this way, we didn't start the best way, but where we are now is incredible. \"We got the most out of it we possibly could. We made silly decisions and ended up in this position, but you can't turn back the clock. So we just stuck with it in here and got as much out of it as we could. \"There is so much we have done that I wouldn't necessarily get access to if this hadn't have happened.\" The mother and baby unit is one of three Action for Children run in prisons in the north of England, and they provide a separate living area for inmates, who are helped to care for their babies by trained prison staff and early years and family support practitioners. During the visit, the princess had a private meeting with the prison's four inmates who are mothers and toured their accommodation and nursery. Kate has made the promotion of the early years development of children one of the key elements of her public work. Amanda Taylor, operational director of children's services at Action for Children, said: \"Given the challenges the mums are going through, it is really important to give the babies the very best start in life. \"The princess' passion is early years and she understands the impact on the outcome of adulthood happens during these critical early years. \"The babies aren't prisoners, the babies happen to be living in this environment. So it's really important for us to give them the best start in life. It's why the environment for them and their mothers is so important.\"\n",

      "Kate travelled to HMP Styal in Cheshire to meet inmates from the women's prison using the services provided by the unit run by Action for Children. The Princess spent almost 90 minutes at HMP Styal in Cheshire, where a unit for prisoners with babies aged under 18 months is run by Action for Children. The visit was arranged to show how mothers and babies can be supported within the justice system.

The Princess met employees and former inmates of HMP Styal, before visiting the on-site nursery and hearing from current prisoners about the support they and their babies were receiving from the charity. The event was Kate's fifth public engagement in just over two weeks as she continues her gradual return to official duties since completing her cancer treatment. Kate has made the promotion of the early years development of children one of the key elements of her public work.  The Princess is determined to use her platform to raise awareness of the importance of the early years. She has highlighted evidence that the psychological attachment between a baby and its primary caregiver in the first few months of life can influence later development. The work undertaken by the Princess's Centre for Early Childhood  is rooted in research that found the experiences of young children aged five and under can lead to social challenges, including addiction, family breakdown, poor mental health, suicide and homelessness.  \n",

      "The King has taken Sir Keir Starmer and Angela Rayner on a tour of the Cornish housing project he inspired - in a rare joint engagement between the monarch and the nation's political leaders.\n",
      "Charles was accompanied by the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister during three visits in Nansledan, a 540-acre extension to the seaside town of Newquay. The King, dressed in a camel coloured coat, spoke to construction workers as the trio toured the site on Monday, with  the group visiting houses, a school and an orchard in in the seaside town. It is understood the royal tour follows discussions surrounding housing in past months between Charles and Sir Keir, in which the Nansledan project was mentioned. Building new homes sits at the top of the government's priority list, with a looming government target of building around 1.5 million new homes by 2029. Sir Keir is said to have expressed an interest in seeing the development in person, with Charles offering to personally show him around the developing site. Both Charles and Sir Keir share an interest in modern housing developments, with Nansledan and Poundbury in Dorset demonstrating the kind of communities the King believes should be created. The Prime Minister has set up a taskforce to create the next generation of new towns as part of his drive to have 1.5 million new homes built before the next election. During the first engagement on Monday, the three principals - as they were referred to by staff - visited Newquay Orchard, which employs 45 staff.

Ms Hill said after the visit: \"It is not often that we get this opportunity and it is really good for us to be able to demonstrate just what can be done.\" She told her visitors how the orchard provides services from career guidance to wellbeing sessions and art events.   At the allotments they spoke to students and volunteers including Rory Bendle, who had met Charles during a previous visit. Mr Bendle, 29, said: \"I was really surprised to see all three of them. \"I met the King when he was Prince Charles. He is a very calm and gentle person. I told him today that my middle name is also Charles and we had a laugh about that. \"I wasn't expecting the Prime Minister to come over and talk to me too. \"He asked me about the orchard. I said it was a field and now it has extended to all this, for the community.\" The orchard was designed to help join the Nansledan community to the rest of Newquay, with the Duchy of Cornwall supporting the development of the community building. Monday's visit is believed to be the first time in recent history that a monarch has been accompanied by the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister on a joint royal engagement, focusing on a royal-inspired project. In 1998, Charles as the Prince of Wales took deputy prime minister John Prescott on a tour of his Poundbury development on Duchy land in Dorchester, Dorset, after personally invited him to see the housing project.\n",

      "Trump has ruled out deporting Prince Harry, after concerns about Harry's former drug use.\n",
      "President Donald Trump has ruled out deporting the Duke of Sussex from the US, it has been reported. Prince Harry now lives in Montecito, California, with his wife Meghan and their children, but questions had been raised about his immigration status because of his admitted former drug use. Mr Trump appeared to have ruled out deportation, telling The New York Post: \"I'll leave him alone.\" He added: \"He's got enough problems with his wife. She's terrible.\" Meghan has previously been a vocal critic of former reality star Mr Trump and called him \"divisive\" and a \"misogynist\". Meghan said she was backing his rival, Hillary Clinton in the 2016 US presidential election, and suggested then that she would leave the US if he won. Harry's reference to taking cocaine, marijuana and psychedelic mushrooms in his book Spare prompted a conservative Washington DC think tank to question why he was allowed into the US in 2020. Read more: Watch moment Israeli hostages are handed to Red Cross by Hamas in third swap of ceasefire Read more: Trump sanctions International Criminal Court as he accuses it of 'targeting' US and 'close ally' Israel In his controversial memoir, Harry said cocaine \"didn't do anything for me\", adding: \"Marijuana is different, that actually really did help me.\" The Heritage Foundation alleged he may have concealed past illegal drug use that should have disqualified him from obtaining a US visa. Earlier this week, the case was in the US courts for the first time since Mr Trump returned to office last month. A judge was being asked to consider whether to vacate a previous ruling that Harry's US visa application should remain private. The Heritage Foundation brought the lawsuit against the Department for Homeland Security (DHS) after a Freedom of Information Act request was rejected, as the think tank claimed it was of \"immense public interest\". US judge Carl Nichols ruled in September 2024 that the public did not have a strong interest in disclosure of Harry's immigration records, but the Heritage Foundation wants the judgment to be changed. The think tank also said answers on Harry's prior drug use in his visa application should have been disclosed, as they could raise questions over the US government's integrity. In the DHS's response to the legal claim, it said: \"Much like health, financial, or employment information, a person's immigration information is private personal information.\"\n",

      "The King and Queen have announced they will undertake a state visit to Italy and the Vatican, Buckingham Palace has confirmed.\n",
      "The major spring tour, which has long been trailed in the media, will take place in early April and coincides with Charles and Camilla's 20th wedding anniversary. They will meet Pope Francis at the Vatican and celebrate the Catholic Church's Pilgrims of Hope jubilee year. In Italy, the couple will visit Rome and the north-eastern city of Ravenna, known for its early Christian mosaic artwork. Charles, 76, is forging ahead with regular overseas trips this year as he adapts to living with cancer. The King and Queen last met the pop at the Vatican on April 4, 2017. The development emerged at the end of the King's long-haul visit to Australia and Samoa, which was described as the \"perfect tonic\" for the monarch. The tour announcement comes the week after Charles travelled to Poland for the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. Charles travelled to the historic death camp last week to mark the 80th anniversary of its liberation on Holocaust Memorial Day. He was seen to join survivors and other dignitaries invited to a service at the site of the former concentration camp in Poland. Read more: King Charles to make history as he visits Auschwitz on 80th anniversary of camp's liberation Read more: Trump sanctions International Criminal Court as he accuses it of 'targeting' US and 'close ally' Israel As part of the forthcoming visit to the Vatican, the couple will attend the Holy See, the government of the Roman Catholic Church. The Vatican, home to the Pope, is the smallest independent state in the world, which is surrounded by Rome and is the residence of the spiritual leadership of the Roman Catholic Church. The King is Supreme Governor of the Church of England. The role dates back to Henry VIII, who named himself Supreme Head of the Church of England after he was excommunicated by the Pope and broke from the Catholic Church in the 16th century to marry Anne Boleyn. Before the state visits, the King and Queen will join Hollywood star Stanley Tucci for a black tie dinner celebrating Italian cuisine at Highgrove on Friday evening. The pair have invited the Italian-American Devil Wears Prada actor and well-known foodie and the Italian ambassador to the UK, Inigo Lambertini, to Charles's Gloucestershire estate to enjoy a feast of sustainable Slow Food. The menu has been created by renowned Italian chef Francesco Mazzei and inspired by Tucci, who fronted the TV series Tucci - The Heart of Italy. Created using entirely British ingredients blended with Italian culinary traditions and local flavours, the dishes aim to embody the principles of Slow Food. Drinks will be prepared by Italian mixologist Alessandro Palazzi using Italian flavours and herbs from Charles's beloved Highgrove Gardens. The Slow Food initiative was launched in 1986 in the small Italian town of Bra when food writer Carlo Petrini took exception to the opening of a McDonald's in Rome's Piazza di Spagna, leading to widespread national protests.  \tIt promotes the right to good, clean and fair food for all, and strives to preserve traditional and regional cuisine.  \tCharles has long been a champion of the Slow Food philosophy.  \tThe event will also promote Slow Fashion, with the King and Queen meeting King's Foundation's students and being shown garments demonstrating their sustainable fashion and heritage skills.  \tThe Slow Fashion movement encourages people to buy fewer, higher-quality items which last longer. \n",

Kate shared a video message in September in which she said her cancer journey had given her a “new perspective on everything” as she reflected on the “simple yet important things in life”. She said: \"Although I have  finished chemotherapy, my path to healing and full recovery is long and I must continue to take each day as it comes. I am however looking forward to being back at work and undertaking a few more public engagements in the coming months when I can.\" Last month, in her first royal engagement of 2025, she made a surprise visit to the Royal Marsden Hospital to personally thank staff who looked after her during her cancer treatment.   \n",

      "Prince William and Kate took part in a Holocaust Memorial Day service in London on Monday to mark the 80th anniversary.\n",
      "Kate joined her husband the Prince of Wales, who described their attendance as \"a great honour\", at Guildhall in central London on the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. The annual event remembers the six million Jewish people murdered during the Holocaust, as well as the millions of other people killed under Nazi persecution and those who died in subsequent genocides. William, wearing a navy suit and blue tie, and Kate, wearing all black, were greeted on arrival by Olivia Marks-Woldman, chief executive of the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust, and its chairwoman of trustees Laura Marks. Speaking to Ms Marks-Woldman, Kate described the commemorations as \"so important\", adding: \"It is great to be here today with my husband.\" The pair were then shown to the Old Library where they met with two tables of survivors and their families. After having formal handshakes, Kate then gave one survivor, Yvonne Bernstein, 87, a warm hug before they clasped each other's hands as they sat together and spoke. The princess said: \"(It is) such a treat for me (to see) an old friend.\" On the second table, Kate also hugged and spoke at length with fellow survivor Steven Frank, 89. The roughly 50 Holocaust survivors in attendance were then gathered for a group photo, with the royals initially continuing to chat with their table as they assembled. William and Kate joined the photo alongside Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner. Once taken, Sir Keir could be heard saying to one survivor that the photo was \"fantastic\". All guests then moved to the Great Hall for a special ceremony. The hall's walls, ceiling and chandeliers were lit purple as the London Youth Chamber Choir performed with an orchestra on stage. Several extracts from memoirs written by Jewish people during the Holocaust were read out, while the testimonies of survivors were also played on TV screens. In a short speech, William said: \"I am honoured to join you today to mark Holocaust Memorial Day and to remember the millions murdered during the Holocaust and in subsequent genocides. \"We also remember those survivors who have lived with scars, both mental and physical. \"Their bravery, in sharing with us the most harrowing moments of their lives, are extremely powerful and ensure that we never forget. I assure them we never will.\" The prince then read an extract from the book Holocaust Heroes, which made reference to the efforts made by his great-grandmother, Princess Alice of Battenberg, to help a Jewish family in need. Giving his own speech, Sir Keir said the Holocaust was a \"collective endeavour\" by ordinary people \"consumed by the hatred of difference\". The Prime Minister said: \"We start by remembering the six million Jewish victims and by defending the truth against anyone who would deny it. So we will have a National Holocaust Memorial and Learning Centre to speak this truth for eternity. \"But as we remember, we must also act. Because we say never again, but where was never again in Cambodia, Rwanda, Bosnia, Darfur, or the acts of genocide against Yazidi. \"Today, we have to make those words mean more. So we will make Holocaust education a truly national endeavour.\" Sir Keir said all schools would teach the Holocaust and give opportunities to hear a recorded survivor testimony so that \"we can develop that empathy for others and that appreciation of our common humanity, which is the ultimate way to defeat the hatred of difference\". Other political attendees at the event were Home Secretary Yvette Cooper and Liberal Democrats leader Sir Ed Davey, as well as the Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley. At the end of the ceremony William and Kate each appeared on stage to gather a flame and light their own candles.\n",

      "The Princess of Wales is said to be \"delighted\" at plans to expand a programme to promote babies' wellbeing across the UK.\n",
      "The Royal Foundation Centre for Early Childhood and the Institute of Health Visiting (iHV) have confirmed the expansion of the trial of a tool used by health visitors within routine checks to eight new areas. The Alarm Distress Baby Scale (ADBB) model is a system Kate saw in practice during a 2022 visit to Denmark that assesses how babies interact with their environment. Read More: Kate keeps promise in emotional return to hospital where she had cancer treatment Read More: Prince William hails Kate's 'remarkable strength' as he sends touching birthday message Under the ADBB model, a baby's eye contact, facial expressions, vocalisation and activity levels are studied to help health professionals and families better understand the ways they express their feelings, and to support parents with bonding. It can also be used to recognise early signs of psychological distress, enabling specialist support to be accessed as soon as it is needed. After Kate saw health visitors in Denmark using the tool, the Centre for Early Childhood then worked with the Institute of Health Visiting (iHV) and Oxford University to test it in the UK. Health visitors involved in phase one - which took place in South Warwickshire NHS Foundation Trust and Humber Teaching NHS Foundation Trust - said they were able to have more meaningful conversations with parents and carers about the emotional wellbeing of their baby. They said they were also able to promote positive parent-infant interactions, attachment, and bonding, and to identify those babies and families in need of greater support. The second phase is funded by a £210,000 grant from the Centre for Early Childhood and will run until March 2026 in eight areas across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. It is understood the Princess of Wales, who has made promoting the early years development of children a major part of her public work, is thrilled by the expansion of the trial. A spokesperson for the princess added: \"The work of the Centre for Early Childhood continues to shine a light on just how important the first five years of life are for any baby and the role we can all play. \"The Princess is delighted to see the expansion of the ADBB trial and looks forward to following it closely.\" Christian Guy, executive director of the Centre for Early Childhood, said: \"We know that warm, loving, responsive interactions with those closest to them during the earliest weeks and months of a baby's life are crucial in promoting positive brain development. \"Health visitors do such a vital job in our communities. I am delighted that we are now able to give more teams across the UK the support they need to help thousands of families to better understand their babies and build nurturing relationships, laying the strongest possible foundations for all that is to come in the years that follow.\" Alison Morton, chief executive of the Institute of Health Visiting, said: \"As we know, babies can't talk, but there is significant evidence that their early experiences influence their future outcomes. \"The expansion of the use of the modified ADBB tool in a wider range of health visiting services will allow us to consider its future implementation and sustainability, and ensure more families get the right support and babies can thrive.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "Kate thanked staff at the Royal Marsden Hospital for her \"exceptional\" care. She also spoke with patients , as it was announced she will be the joint royal patron there, alongside her husband, Prince William. The princess was also said to want to show her support to those currently going through cancer treatment, and met patients receiving care at the hospital in central London on Tuesday. The official engagement, Kate's first of 2025, coincided with the announcement that the princess has become joint royal patron of The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, joining the Prince of Wales in the role.  \t The patronage was once held by Diana, Princess of Wales. A message on social media, signed 'C', said: \"I wanted to take the opportunity to say thank you to The Royal Marsden for looking after me so well during the past year.  \t \"My heartfelt thanks goes to all those who have quietly walked alongside William and me as we have navigated everything.  \t \"We couldn't have asked for more.

As anyone who has experienced a cancer diagnosis will know, it takes time to adjust to a new normal.  \t \"I am however looking forward to a fulfilling year ahead. There is much to look forward to. Thank you to everyone for your continued support.\" Talking to Katherine Field, 45, who was wearing a cold cap during her chemotherapy to preserve her hair, the Princess of Wales gestured to her own arm and chest to discuss the \"port\" mechanism to deliver the medicine.  \t \"I got so attached to it,\" the princess said, joking that she had hesitated when finally told \"you can have it taken out\" now.  \t She is not thought to have used a cold cap herself. Hearing about one man's diagnosis, the Princess of Wales said: \"The body is amazing at telling us 'you need to take time out'.\"  \t Asked how she was feeling, Kate replied that she was doing well, but recalled the cycle of treatment saying \"sometimes you feel relatively well, and then you have another one.  \t \"Sometimes from the outside we all think you've finished treatment and you go back to things. But it's hard to get back to normal.\"  \t She told several patients it was so important to keep \"doing the things that give you joy\".  \"It makes you appreciate all the small things in life that you take for granted,\" she said of a cancer diagnosis.  \t The Princess also spoke to doctors and nurses involved in care and research, as well as pilot projects at the Marsden to improve holistic care.  \t Speaking of receiving a diagnosis, she said: \"It's the uncertainty of that initial diagnosis. It's such a wealth of information. Understanding the diagnosis, it's a massive amount of information to take on as a patient. Having that continuity, in the clinical setting and outside in the home setting, is so important.\"   Of the wider impact of treatment on patients, the princess added: \"You think the treatment has finished and you can crack on and get back to normal, but that's still a real challenge. The words totally disappear. And understanding that as a patient, yes there are side effects around treatment but actually there are more long term side effects.\"\n",

      "Kate returned to the Royal Marsden Hospital in Chelsea, west London, on Tuesday morning, in an \"incredibly poignant\" visit to the place she received cancer treatment.  The surprise solo engagement - Kate's first this year - was described as an important moment in the Princess' \"personal journey\". Princess Kate was diagnosed with cancer last year and had to withdraw from royal duties as she underwent treatment.

The unannounced visit coincided with the news that Kate has become joint royal patron of the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, alongside the Prince of Wales. The patronage was once held by Diana, Princess of Wales, and William has been its president for many years, but will now serve as co-patron with Kate. William described 2024 as one of the most \"brutal\" years of his life. He spoke candidly about the royal family's major health scares, saying 2024 had been a \"dreadful\" experience. He said: \"Honestly, it's been dreadful. It's probably been the hardest year in my life. \"So, trying to get through everything else and keep everything on track has been really difficult. \"But I'm so proud of my wife, I'm proud of my father, for handling the things that they have done. \"But from a personal family point of view, it's been, yeah, it's been brutal.\" Speaking of her difficult 2024 in December, Kate said: \"I didn’t know this time last year it was going to be the year I’ve just had.\" In June, the princess, in a candid written message, revealed she was \"making good progress\" but had \"good days and bad days\", was \"not out of the woods yet\" and was facing a few more months of treatment. In September, the princess confirmed she had completed her treatment, but revealed that she, William and their children had faced an \"incredibly tough\" time.\n",

      "Kate is celebrating her 43rd birthday at home in Windsor with her family, after a challenging past 12 months. After she underwent abdominal surgery at the start of the year, she was diagnosed with cancer. She temporarily stepped down from royal duties while receiving chemotherapy treatment throughout the year. Praising her strength, William said: \"To the most incredible wife and mother. The strength you’ve shown over the last year has been remarkable.  \"George, Charlotte, Louis and I are so proud of you.  \"Happy Birthday, Catherine. We love you. W\" The message was accompanied by a new, unseen black and white picture of Kate taken by Matt Porteous in Windsor last summer. It showed Kate looking relaxed and smiling with her hands in her jeans pockets and wearing a gingham scarf.

She spent nearly two weeks in the London Clinic after the major surgery, and was recuperating at home when she was told she had cancer and had to begin chemotherapy.  \t The royal family is hoping for a better 2025 after what William described as a \"brutal\" and probably \"the hardest year\" of his life, with his father, the King, also diagnosed with the disease. Kate is expected to continue her gradual return to public duties with more appearances this year. Announcing the end of her treatment in September, Kate said: \"Doing what I can to stay cancer free is now my focus.  \t \"Although I have finished chemotherapy, my path to healing and full recovery is long and I must continue to take each day as it comes.\"\n",

      "The couple shared their favourite moments from 2024 through a heartwarming series of photos and video clips, as they wished their followers a happy new year. The last year has been a difficult one for the family, with Kate having undergone chemotherapy after being diagnosed with cancer. She took a step back from royal duties at the start of the year to focus on her treatment and is now going into 2025 without the threat of cancer hanging over her head. Read more: Kate and King Charles' cancer battles in 2024 as Palace focuses on road to recovery Read more: Kate's Christmas 'message of love' at Carol concert as she opens up about 'vulnerabilities' William's father, King Charles, was also diagnosed with cancer this year. He was receiving treatment to address a benign enlarged prostate condition when “a separate issue of concern was noted”. Buckingham Palace first told of Charles' diagnosis in February, announcing the King was undergoing treatment for an unspecified form of cancer at a private hospital in London. William and Kate chose to focus on the positives in their end of year post to both Instagram and X, captioning the message: \"2024. Happy New Year! Wishing you all a wonderful 2025.\" The pictures feature special moments from time the family spent together and the limited number of engagements Kate was able to attend while undergoing treatment. A family photo included in the post was originally shared as she announced her chemotherapy treatment had ended and her focus was \"doing what I can to stay cancer free\". The photograph, taken from a video released by Kate in September, shows the family enjoying the outdoors. It was also the picture used in their 2024 Christmas card. Also included in the highlight reel was Taylor Swift taking a selfie with the Prince of Wales and two of his children, George and Charlotte, on the night of the pop star's concert at Wembley.  The singer spent time with the royal family backstage during one of her Eras Tour shows.  There are also photos from Kate's annual star-studded carol service at Westminster Abbey, which was broadcast on Christmas Eve. The event held extra significance for the 42-year-old as it marked the first Christmas carol service since she disclosed her cancer diagnosis earlier this year. In a heartfelt speech that opened the broadcast, the princess spoke about how Christmas offers a chance to reflect on “our own vulnerabilities.” The service featured performances from musicians such as Olivia Dean, a 25-piece steel pan band and a jazz ensemble from Restore the Music, a nonprofit supporting music education for the youth. Guests also heard readings based on themes of love and empathy delivered by Prince William.\n",

      "The comments were part of Kate's annual star-studded carol service at Westminster Abbey, which was broadcast on Christmas Eve. It is the fourth the Princess has hosted the fourth celebration to mark the beginning of the holiday season.  The event, which was pre-recorded, took place at Westminster Abbey on December 6. It also holds extra significance for the 42-year-old as it marked the first Christmas carol service since she disclosed her cancer diagnosis earlier this year. A difficult year for the royals, King Charles III, was also diagnosed with cancer earlier this year. In a heartfelt speech that opened the broadcast, the princess spoke about how Christmas offers a chance to reflect on “our own vulnerabilities.” The service featured performances from musicians such as Olivia Dean, a 25-piece steel pan band and a jazz ensemble from Restore the Music, a nonprofit supporting music education for the youth. Guests also heard readings based on themes of love and empathy delivered by Prince William. She said: “Christmas is one of my favourite times of the year, it is a time for presents, tinsel and mince pies, but it’s also a time to slow down and reflect on the deeper things that connect us all. “The Christmas story encourages us to consider the experiences and feelings of others,” she added. “It also reflects our own vulnerabilities and reminds us of the importance of giving and receiving empathy, as well as just how much we need each other in spite of our differences.  \"Above all else, it encourages us to turn to love, not fear.” She continued: “The love that we show ourselves and the love we show others. Love that listens with empathy, love that is kind and understanding, love that is forgiving, and love that brings joy and hope.” “It is love which is the greatest gift we can receive, not just at Christmas but every day of our lives.” The service was broadcast as part of the programme Royal Carols: Together At Christmas, screened on ITV1 and ITVX on Christmas Eve, and will feature three films about the stories of people and organisations who have inspired, counselled and comforted others in their times of need.\n",

      "Prince Andrew School - the only secondary school on the remote British overseas territory of St Helena - is asking its students to suggest something more \"neutral\".  \t The decision stems from \"recent public controversy\" and \"negative media coverage\", and has been approved by Buckingham Palace, a statement from the government of St Helena said.  \t The tiny island sits in the South Atlantic Ocean some 1,165 miles west of mainland Africa, and has a population of around 4,000.  \t It is known for being the site of Napoleon Bonaparte's second period of exile after his defeat at the Battle of Waterloo.  \t Read more: 'Dangerous, weird and whining': Inside Lucy Letby's life behind bars Read more: ‘I flew to Spain and bought olive oil for under £7.38 - that's how much a bottle costs in Britain' Head teacher Phil Toal said: \"While we respect history, we must also be mindful of how past associations impact the present and future.  \t \"Choosing a new name allows us to honour the contributions of our students and community without the burden of controversial ties.\"  \t Andrew's namesake, which opened in 1989, is surrounded by woodland and boasts majestic views across James Bay, according to its website.  \t The new name is expected to be chosen by the end of February, and will be launched at the start of the next academic year in September.  \t \"The school believes this change is a crucial step in ensuring its name embodies the values, aspirations, and identity of its students and the wider community,\" the statement said.  \t \"The decision to rename the school stems from several factors, including recent public controversy and negative media coverage.  \t \"The school believes a neutral name will foster a positive and forward-thinking learning environment, free from contentious associations.\"  \t Furore erupted in 2019 over Andrew's friendship with convicted US paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.  \t He stepped away from his public role and later paid millions to settle a civil sexual assault case with Virginia Giuffre, a woman he claimed never to have met.  \t The duke, 64, hit the headlines once again last year after a High Court hearing revealed alleged Chinese spy Yang Tengbo, who was banned from the UK, was said to have been a \"close\" confidant.\n",

      "The Princess Royal has returned to the intensive care unit where she was treated after her horse-related accident to thank NHS staff, saying the visit was really useful for \"filling in the blanks\".\n",
      "Anne told medical crews at Southmead Hospital in Bristol who were involved in looking after her following the incident in June 2024: \"Sadly, I don't have huge memories of being in here either. \"I just know I was really well looked after so thank you.\" Read More: Kate shares new image taken by Prince Louis to mark World Cancer Day The 74-year-old princess, who was on her way to see her chickens on her Gatcombe Park estate when the incident happened, has no memory of what followed, but is thought to have been struck by a horse's head or legs. An air ambulance and emergency services were dispatched to Anne's Gloucestershire home and, following medical care by the crew, the princess was taken by road 30 miles to Southmead. It had not previously been known that Anne, who drove herself to the engagement on Thursday, had been treated in intensive care. Anne, in a short speech, told staff who cared for her: \"You've been filling in the blanks, which partly, from my perspective, is really useful to know what happened because I seriously don't have any idea and, sadly, I don't have huge memories of being in here either. I just know I was really well looked after so thank you. \"But whatever you did, it seemed to work... the recovery being relatively straightforward, thankfully. That isn't always true so I'm really grateful. \"I'm also grateful in a weird sort of way that I remember nothing because that has huge advantages - you can just carry on. Anne appeared to joke about her horses and which one was responsible for her injuries, saying: \"I know if there was a perpetrator who managed to do that much damage, they're not letting on either, so relationships remain absolutely secure. \"No one has gone absent as a result of this.\" The King's sister spent five nights in the facility after her accident on June 23 and did not return to public royal duties until almost three weeks later after rehabilitation support at home. At the time, Buckingham Palace said the princess \"remains in Southmead Hospital, Bristol, as a precautionary measure for observation\". Anne has described how \"every day is a bonus\" after she suffered concussion and minor head injuries. On a recent tour to South Africa, the princess remarked of the incident: \"It just reminds you, shows you - you never quite know, something (happens) and you might not recover.\" Most of the princess's visit to the ICU was private. She walked along the critical care corridor of the unit, meeting staff at different intensive care pods while machines could be heard beeping intermittently. The princess was introduced to the discharge team who helped with her care including major trauma practitioner Nicholas Crease, occupational therapist Helen Marshall, ICU clinical lead physiotherapist Emma Wickman, and the trust's medical director Dr Sam Patel. ICU matron Morwenna Maddock introduced Anne to the team, telling the princess: \"There were very heavily involved.\" Dr Patel said to Anne: \"We would see each other on and off.... It was very much the team.\" He spoke later about the importance of patients putting together the pieces of their stay in the intensive care unit. \"It's important for anyone that's been cared for to close the loop,\" he said. He added: \"I think if patients understand the nature of the problem, the nature of their pathway, that's half of the battle, and I think they can then build on that.\" Ms Maddock said after the visit: \"It was really nice for her to come back and see the team... It's really important for our staff to see that their hard work has paid off.\" Among those who treated the princess was Steven Pullin, a volunteer community responder, who was the first on the scene at Gatcombe Park. An air ambulance crew was called, along with a second critical care team and an ambulance with paramedics on board who took the princess to hospital. Emergency care assistant James Teakle drove the ambulance and recalled the journey took 34 minutes. Mr Teakle said: \"I know the area so could work out who it was. It was just another job, but a person of importance. I wouldn't have done anything different for anyone else.\" Anne also met paramedic Sophie Taylor, who accompanied her to the hospital, and the two-man critical care team who treated her at the scene: doctor Richard Jeavons and specialist paramedic Callum Sutton, who both work for Great Western Air Ambulance Charity. Maria Kane, joint chief executive of the North Bristol NHS Trust, thanked Anne for her return visit, saying it had given staff a boost. Ms Kane said: \"I know staff who talked to you earlier today have been very very grateful to hear that you've made such a lovely recovery and look so well today. We're absolutely thrilled and delighted to hear that. \"Everyone who has been involved in your care has been wishing you well.\" The ICU at Southmead Hospital is a purpose built 48-bedded unit which admits more 2,000 patients each year, making it one of the busiest in the country. The hospital is the regional specialist intensive care unit for departments such as major trauma, neurosciences, plastic surgery and burns, and infectious diseases. North Bristol NHS Trust is one of the largest hospital trusts in the UK with more than 13,000 staff.\n",

      "Meghan Markle shares thank you video after a heartfelt donation to victims of LA fires from singer Billie Eilish.\n",
      "The Duchess of Sussex resurfaced on Instagram to share her gratitude to singer Billie Eilish after she donated signed merchandise to a victim of the Los Angeles fires. In the video, posted on Tuesday, Markle explained that her and Prince Harry had visited victims of the wildfires in Altadena, Los Angeles, which was devastated by the wildfires. Markle met a young woman, and her family, who had lost their home.  The young woman said that the one item she searched for in their evacuation was her Billie Eilish tour t-shirt - but she couldn't find it. The Duchess decided to get in contact with Eilish, and get the 15-year-old girl some merchandise. She said: \"I thought of everybody that I knew and I made a voice note, and I was like, 'Please can someone get this voice note to Billie Eilish? Here's what I'm asking.'\" Markle gleefully showed a stack of merchandise sent by Eilish, including t-shirts, records and a lunchbox. She said: \"Huge thank you, Billie Eilish, this is going to mean so much to her, and honestly, to Adam Levine and Bahati, you guys helped me get this over the line, and to everyone who is showing up for people in big and small ways to get through what's happened in California, just thank you so much.\" The Duchess said she was going to email the girl's mother - and get the merch to her. She revealed it was star Adam Levine who had helped her secure the merch. Markle can be seen, with seemingly no make-up, jeans and a jumper with her two children's names embroidered onto it - Archie and Lilibet.  She joked that she feels 'old', as she didn't know what the references on the Eilish merchandise meant. She ended her video with a heartfelt message: \"Thanks to everyone who made this possible but most importantly, thank you to our first responders who are the community’s real heroes.\" Read more: Trump gives advisers instructions to 'obliterate' Iran should the nation attempt to assassinate him Read more: Trump signs executive order to withdraw US from UN human rights council Harry and Meghan live in Montecito, near Santa Barbara, some 90 miles from Los Angeles.  It is believed that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex donated to the Altadena Girls Fire Recovery Fund via their Archewell Foundation. The couple were seen handing out food parcels to those affected by the wildfires at the Pasadena Convention Centre in January. The building is being used as an evacuation centre for the thousands who have been forced to flee their homes while the blaze rages on. Harry and Meghan seemed to console the Mayor of Pasadena Victor Gordo, after having also spoken to emergency crews involved in the response. The couple were keen to offer up support in any way they could, the Mayor said, adding that they were \"great people\" with \"great personalities\". \"They really buoyed the spirits of the first responders,\" Mr Gordo said. \"We visited the command post at the Rose Bowl and people were very happy to see them.\" The couple also spoke to World Central Kitchen (WCK) founder chef Jose Andres. WCK has pop-up locations around California, including at the Pasadena Community Centre, where the public and emergency crews could get free hot meals in the wake of the wildfires. It is believed the couple have donated clothing, children's items and other essential supplies for people affected by the fires.  They also invited friends and loved ones who had been forced to evacuate into their home, it is understood. The couple said on their website: \"In the last few days, wildfires in southern California have raged through neighbourhoods and devastated families, homes, schools, medical care centres, and so much more - affecting tens of thousands from all walks of life.\" They added: \"If a friend, loved one, or pet has to evacuate, and you are able to offer them a safe haven in your home, please do. \"Be sure to check in with any disabled or elderly neighbours to see if they need help evacuating. \"Some families and people have been left with nothing. Please consider donating clothing, children's toys and other essentials. The American Red Cross is on the ground helping those in need.\"\n",

      "The clip featured a number of celebrities, scientists and charity workers, who all shared heartfelt messages to those affected by cancer. Sharing it on Instagram, the royal family said: \"This World Cancer Day, we are sending love to all those navigating a cancer diagnosis – as well as the incredible doctors, nurses, charities and families who work tirelessly to support them.\" It comes almost a year on from when both the King and Princess Kate announced that they had been diagnosed with cancer.

She was diagnosed in May 2023 and went through chemotherapy as well as having a mastectomy. Meanwhile, cycling legend Sir Chris Hoy revealed in October last year that his cancer was terminal and that he had two to four years left to live. He said in the clip: \"We're all in this together, you are not alone.  \"Keep living life every single day and keep smiling, and don't forget to enjoy the here and the now.\" Olympic diver Tom Daley and presenter Adele Roberts also filmed segments for the video. Roberts said: \"Don't be afraid to ask for help, and, if you can, do something every day that makes you truly happy.  \t\"When I was diagnosed with bowel cancer, it was overwhelming.  \t \"I knew I couldn't control what it did to my body, but I was determined not to let it affect my spirit. You've got this. Lots of love.\" Daley said: \"Today on World Cancer Day I would just like to say a huge thank you to all the nurses, doctors, scientists and researchers that are continuously trying to find a cure for cancer.  \"My Dad passed away in 2011, but I want to say that whether you know someone or whether you've been recently diagnosed, we are all in this together and whatever you can do to smile every day is important.\" The royals did not make an appearance in the video, but Kate did release a photograph of herself on Monday to mark the occasion. She was snapped outdoors by her son, Prince Louis, on a wintry day and shown with her arms out-stretched in the middle of a woodland area.  \t The image was posted alongside a personal message from Kate which read: \"Don't forget to nurture all that which lies beyond the disease.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "There have been calls for a fresh FBI probe into the royal after it emerged he told Epstein that they would \"play some more soon\" two months after he claimed their relationship had ended. The disgraced brother of King Charles wrote to Epstein on the same day a photograph of him emerged with 17-year-old Virginia Giuffre - who claimed she was trafficked by the convicted paedophile. Andrew had earlier said that he had cut off contact with Epstein in December 2010 - but this message from late February 2011, said: \"Keep in close touch and we’ll play some more soon.\" Read more: Prince Andrew won't join Royal Family at Sandringham Christmas amid Chinese ‘spy’ scandal Read more: Prince Andrew reported to police for 'using fake name', as fresh royal row erupts Now reports have emerged that Andrew allegedly fears he will be arrested if he travels to the United States. A friend of Andrew told The Sun: “He is terrified if he goes to America he could be arrested, face civil action or be subpoenaed. “He used to be Air Miles Andy but he’ll never risk going to America again. \"Since the whole thing blew up, he’s only been to Bahrain, where he has friends. There hasn’t been a single golf trip to Spain or holiday abroad.” A lawyer for many of Epstein’s victims has called for President Trump’s new FBI chief to conduct a full investigation into Andrew. Spencer Kuvin said: “The British monarchy should be embarrassed. He should be fully separated from the monarchy and the public should never be subsidising someone who has either such bad judgment to be friends with this man or could have been involved with him. “The President should require his new FBI director to fully investigate Andrew’s conduct. “The Government should turn him over for that and demand he volunteer himself to be a part of it. The King should do that, “Andrew should be held accountable by the monarchy.” Andrew has strenuously denied claims against him and insisted he has no memory of encountering Ms Giuffre. He settled her case against him, reportedly to the tune of several millions of pounds.\n",

      "Bela Bajaria, Chief Content Officer at the streaming giant, has hit back at claims Netflix is looking to split from the Sussexes. It comes after Prince Harry’s five-part documentary POLO was met with poor reviews and even poorer ratings. But Netflix looks set to stand by the couple, with Bajaria insisting Meghan’s upcoming lifestyle series will reverse their fortunes. “We have Meghan's new show coming out, which is great,” she told the Mail Online. “It is such a great take on a lifestyle show and showcase for California, Montecito and nature. It really has great takeaways.

However, Netflix have yet to confirm the adaptation will be released but insist it remains in “development.” “It is in development. It is a great book, she had it and we are happy to do it,” Bajaria said. “And we have things in development. Everyone is excited about what is coming. I am really excited for her show.” This show of support comes after Harry won his long-running legal battle against the publisher of the Sun, as well as 'substantial' damages and an unprecedented apology. Prince Harry and former Labour deputy leader Lord Tom Watson, brought legal action against News Group Newspapers (NGN) over allegations of unlawful information gathering by journalists and private investigators between 1996 to 2011. Rupert Murdoch’s media empire has accepted - for the first time - unlawful activity at The Sun. The media group apologised for the intrusion into Harry’s private life, and apologised for the treatment of his mother, Princess Diana, ‘in particular during his younger years’. NGN also conceded that Lord Watson had his phone hacked and was placed under surveillance between 2009 and 2011 when he was a serving MP investigating the phone hacking scandal. NGN apologised to Harry, saying: \"NGN offers a full and unequivocal apology to the Duke of Sussex for the serious intrusion by The Sun between 1996 and 2011 into his private life, including incidents of unlawful activities carried out by private investigators working for The Sun. \"NGN also offers a full and unequivocal apology to the Duke of Sussex for the phone hacking, surveillance and misuse of private information by journalists and private investigators instructed by them at the News of the World. \"NGN further apologises to the Duke for the impact on him of the extensive coverage and serious intrusion into his private life as well as the private life of Diana, Princess of Wales, his late mother, in particular during his younger years.\"\n",

      "Kensington Palace will stop regularly releasing details of Kate’s outfits as the Princess of Wales is reportedly frustrated with the public’s focus on her outfits rather than her work.\n",
      "The Princess of Wales’s outfits have always been at the centre of her public appearances, as people routinely scrutinise, judge and copy her fashion. Her outfits have contributed to the success of many fashion houses and designers in the past, who will sorely miss the highly sought-after publicity. She has repeatedly topped world best-dressed lists, and the ‘Kate effect’ - when clothes become incredibly popular after Kate is spotted wearing them - was reported in 2021 to have boosted the British fashion industry by up to £1 billion a year. But now, Kensington Palace has announced they will stop officially announcing her outfits to the public, as Kate feels her style is commanding too much attention. Kate has been frustrated by a perceived focus on her style rather than the substance of her work, according to the Sunday Times. The newspaper reported that Kensington Palace may still issue details on outfits or jewellery worn for important state and family events, despite the changes in relation to other public engagements. The palace has in the past frequently issued information to the media on the clothes and jewellery worn by Kate. As a result, brands have often received a boost from the so-called \"Kate effect\" after their lines are worn by the royal. Kate was famously photographed wearing a £40 TopShop dress on her birthday in 2012, which sold out within 24 hours. She has since launched several collections for TopShop, which all sold out rapidly. A Kensington Palace source told the Sunday Times: \"There is an absolute feeling that it is not about what the princess is wearing. \"She wants the focus to be on the really important issues, the people and the causes she is spotlighting.” Kensington Palace did not issue details of Kate's outfit to the media during two recent engagements in south Wales. Kate made a solo visit on Thursday, meeting youngsters at the Ty Hafan Children's Hospice. The princess, who confirmed last month she is in remission from cancer, has become patron of the hospice as she continues her gradual return to public duties. Kate also visited the Welsh knitwear and sock manufacturer Corgi in Ammanford, Carmarthenshire to shine a light on British industry. The source added: \"There will always be an appreciation of what the princess is wearing from some of the public and she gets that. \"But do we need to be officially always saying what she is wearing? No. The style is there but it's about the substance.\" It comes as Kate launches a new initiative aimed at developing the nation's \"social and emotional skills\" to alleviate the human cost from a world sometimes filled with \"mistrust and misunderstanding\". Kate said the state of modern life was leaving many feeling \"isolated and vulnerable\" during troubled periods, resulting in \"poor mental health, addiction and abuse\" that was \"devastating\" for those affected and society. Kate's Royal Foundation Centre for Early Childhood has published the Shaping Us Framework aimed at increasing awareness of these soft or life skills to inspire action across society.\n",

He claimed to have cut off contact with Epstein \"well before\" he joined Barclays, but emails reveal the pair were in touch until at least the run up to his appointment in 2015.

Andrew wrote back to make sure he had the right date, and added: “keep in close touch and we’ll play some more soon”. Emails also show that Peter Mandelson, a former minister and recently appointed UK ambassador to Washington, had been in contact with Epstein.  The messages also suggest that Mandelson stayed with Epstein in New York in 2012. A spokesman for the Mandelson said previously that he \"very much regrets ever having been introduced to Epstein. He added: \"This connection has been a matter of public record for some time.

Survivors were applauded as the entered the ceremony before addressing invited guests including France's President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Spain's King Philip VI and Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

The royal was greeted on the runway by Colonel Byliniax, as he arrived at Krakow Airport, in Balice, Poland, on Monday, ahead of the main commemoration event attended by world leaders. The King made history, as he attended commemorations at Auschwitz-Birkenau, marking 80 years since the liberation of the concentration camp. It's a journey Charles has described as a \"deeply personal pilgrimage\" according to officials. The commemorations are taking place at the notorious former death camp, where 1.1 million people were murdered during the Second World War.  Speaking from a Jewish community centre in Kracow, the King said:  \"The act of remembering the evils of the past remains a vital task, and in so doing, we inform our present and shape our future.\" \"Here in Krakow, from the ashes of the Holocaust, the Jewish community has been reborn.\" Charles added that there was \"no greater symbol\" of that rebirth than the community centre within which he speaks. \"In a post-Holocaust world projects such as this, this centre is how we recover our faith in humanity,\" he told a captive audience. \"They also show us there is much work still to be done,\" he added. Charles opened the centre in 2008, greeting dozens of well-wishers outside the building on Monday. Some people held out their hands for the King to shake, while others held up their smartphones to capture his visit. During a Buckingham Palace event earlier this month to mark Holocaust Memorial Day, held annually on the day Auschwitz - which was in German-occupied Poland - was liberated, the King said: \"I feel I must go for the 80th anniversary, (it's) so important.\" The King continued that the public should use history \"to inspire us to build a kinder and more compassionate world for future generations\".  \"This remains the sacred task of us all.\" Commemorations at the former death camp began earlier when Poland's president Andrzej Duda joined Auschwitz survivors laying wreaths and candles at the site. Their tributes were left at a reconstruction of the Death Wall, the site where several thousand people, mainly Polish political prisoners, were executed. In a speech, Mr Duda said \"we Poles are the guardians of memory today\" and had a duty to maintain the life stories of the survivors. More than a million people, mostly Jews but also Poles, Soviet prisoners of war and other nationalities, were murdered by the Nazis at Auschwitz-Birkenau during the Second World War as part of the Holocaust in which six million Jewish men, women and children were killed.This is a developing story.\n",

      "William and Kate will pay their respects at a service in London on the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz on Monday. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is also expected to attend and speak at the service, along with faith and civic leaders and survivors of the Holocaust and more recent genocides. The annual event remembers the six million Jewish people murdered during the Holocaust, as well as the millions of other people killed under Nazi persecution and those who died in subsequent genocides. Both the prince and princess, then the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, attended a service marking the 75th anniversary in 2020, while Kate also took photographs of Holocaust survivors at Kensington Palace. Kate, 43, made a surprise return to public appearances earlier this month when she gave thanks to medical teams at The Royal Marsden hospital in London, where she received her cancer treatment.

The King has travelled to Auschwitz in Poland for the anniversary, where he will join survivors and other dignitaries at the site of the former concentration camp for his own service. It comes as David Lammy said the next generation must not be allowed to focus on online \"clickbait\" and ignore the grim lessons of the Holocaust. The Foreign Secretary said youngsters needed to understand \"how the seeds of such a catastrophe are still around us\".  Speaking at a reception co-hosted by the Israeli embassy in the UK, Mr Lammy said: \"'Never again' is a solemn promise which we owe to the victims, but also which we must uphold for our own sake, and for the sake of future generations. \"We need Holocaust remembrance. Holocaust education. Action against antisemitism - it is how we build a better future for us all together.\" At the event in the Foreign Office he highlighted a digital exhibition featuring 80 objects from filmed testimonies of British Holocaust survivors and refugees, presented as 80 individual social media posts. He said: \"Eighty years on from the defeat of Nazism, the number of survivors still with us is inevitably dwindling.  \t \"The world of the 1930s and '40s can feel ever more distant from our high-tech world of today.  The next generation risks being distracted, clickbait making it all too easy not to grasp the full horror of the Holocaust. \"We therefore need to find new ways to tell the story, to capture people's imagination, young people's most of all, and prompt real reflection. \"We need them to understand what a catastrophic moral failure for humanity Auschwitz was, and how the seeds of such a catastrophe are still around us.\" Tottenham MP Mr Lammy said: \"As a black man descended from the Windrush generation, as MP for the most diverse constituency in Britain - including, I am proud to say, a thriving Jewish community - and now, as Foreign Secretary, I see all too many signs of that lingering infection. \"Auschwitz did not start in its gas chambers. Genocide does not start with genocide.\n",

      "The King will make history as he becomes the first British monarch to visit the Auschwitz concentration camp on Monday. \n",
      "\n",
      "Charles will travel to the death camp to mark the 80th anniversary of its liberation as the world pays tribute to victims and survivors on Holocaust Memorial Day. He will join survivors and other dignitaries invited to a service at the site of the former concentration camp in Poland on Monday, also meeting the country's President Andrzej Duda during his brief visit. It is not Charles’ first time visiting Poland but it will be the first time a reigning monarch has visited the site of one of the Nazi regimes’ most despicable crimes. Charles’ son, the Prince of Wales, will attend commemoration services in London in the King’s absence. It comes as Sir Keir Starmer is set to speak of the \"collective endeavour\" to defeat the \"hatred of difference\" on Holocaust Memorial Day. In a statement, the PM will pay tribute to the six million Jewish people murdered by the Nazi regime and renewed his commitment to ensure all schools across the country teach students about the genocide. \"The Holocaust was a collective endeavour by thousands of ordinary people utterly consumed by the hatred of difference,\" Sir Keir is expected to say. \"That is the hatred we stand against today and it is a collective endeavour for all of us to defeat it. \"We must start by remembering the six million Jewish victims and by defending the truth against anyone who would deny it.\" “As we remember, we must also act,\" the PM is expected to add, pointing other atrocities in Cambodia, Rwanda, Bosnia and Darfur which followed the Holocaust. \"Today, we have to make those words mean more. We will make Holocaust education a truly national endeavour. \"We will ensure all schools teach it and seek to give every young person the opportunity to hear a recorded survivor testimony, because by learning from survivors we can develop that empathy for others and that appreciation of our common humanity, which is the ultimate way to defeat the hatred of difference. \"It happened, it can happen again: that is the warning of the Holocaust to us all. And it's why it is a duty for all of us to make 'never again' finally mean what it says: never again.\" The Prime Minister has also visited Auschwitz earlier this month, where he vowed to fight the \"poison of antisemitism\". On Wednesday, he welcomed a group of survivors and their families to Downing Street, describing the meeting as \"an incredible privilege\" and praising their \"sheer and remarkable courage\". Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch highlighted the importance of combating the “resurgence of antisemitism today” as she reflected on the “unique evil” of the Holocaust. Meanwhile, Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey called on Britain to guard against “antisemitism, hatred, discrimination and oppression.”\n",

Ricco told a New York court today: “Although I have provided Sean Combs with the high level of legal representation expected by the court, under no circumstances can I continue to effectively serve as counsel for Sean Combs. \"There are sufficient reasons (related to the protections afforded by the attorney/client privilege) for brevity in my application for withdrawal as counsel in this case.” Read more: Urgent warning for iPhone users as Apple to remove highest level of data protection amid government security row Read more: Ukraine has 'no cards left to play' Trump claims as he slams Starmer for 'doing nothing' to end Russia's war The case is due to move forward in May. Combs is being held at Brooklyn’s Metropolitan Detention Center after being arrested in September. Authorities claim the music mogul held alleged “freak off” parties, where he allegedly \"used force, threats of force and coercion, to cause victims to engage in extended sex acts”. Last year his homes in Miami and Los Angeles were raided. Prosecutors allege they found 1,000 bottles of baby oil and lubricant. Diddy is also facing dozens of lawsuits from women and men who accuse him of sexual assault and harassment.\n",

      "Andrew Tate caused outrage after he shared a 'disgusting' comment regarding Ariana Grande's appearance.  The self proclaimed \"misogynist\", 38, was arrested in 2022 in Romania. He was arrested on suspicion of rape, human trafficking and forming an organised crime group to sexually exploit women. Taking to social media site X on Wednesday, he said: \"I'm sorry Ariana Grande you're too skinny and I would no longer f**k you. Access denied.\" He went on to leave another comment, under a post of the Wicked star, 31, saying she \"looks like a crack h*e.\" \"This is the most disrespectful and disgusting tweet I’ve seen today,\" one user responded. \"She's more famous than you, has more money, more success, has an amazing reputation, and hasn't been to jail,\" another added. This comes as Ariana Grande's appearance at the BAFTAs sparked concerns for her health. Fans worry that she has lost an extreme amount of weight since appearing in blockbuster film, Wicked.

This week, President Trump’s administration has pressured the Romanian government to lift travel restrictions on Andrew Tate, according to reports. The self-proclaimed misogynist is facing allegations of trafficking of minors, sexual intercourse with a minor and money laundering, alongside his brother Tristan. The siblings, who are dual UK and US citizens and vocal supporters of Trump, deny any wrongdoing. Andrew, 38, and Tristan, 36, were released from house arrest by a Romanian court last month pending the outcome of the investigation. However, they remain under judicial control and can travel within Romania but not leave the country. Their case has now been raised by US officials in a phone call with the Romanian government last week, according to the Financial Times. Trump’s special envoy, Richard Grenell, then reportedly pressed the matter in a meeting with Emil Hurezeanu, the Romanian foreign minister, at the Munich Security Conference.\n",

      "The Duchess of Sussex took to Instagram last night to share a candid mood-board. Recently surpassing 2 million followers, her fans were delighted to have a glimpse into her inner-workings. The board featured inspirational images, quotes, and trinkets that she has seemingly collected. One quote read: \"You cannot make everybody happy, you are not a jar of Nutella.\" Another said: \"Stay close to people who feel like sunshine.\" Keen followers noticed that she included labels from her new brand, As Ever, seemingly for her raspberry jam. The board also has a watercolour painting of Prince Harry and Meghan, with their rescue dog - Guy the beagle - who died earlier this year. The Duchess also peppered the board with images of fruit on toast, a smiling pancake, a peacock, flowers, and landscape scenes. She even referenced her old blog - The Tig - with a recipe to her original drink, the 'Signature Tig Cup'. This comes as officials in the Spanish village of Porreres on the island of Mallorca are reportedly considering legal action against the Duchess of Sussex after alleging she copied the town’s traditional coat of arms for the logo of her newly relaunched luxury brand, As Ever. The two images bear a striking resemblance, both featuring a single palm tree flanked by two tropical looking birds. The Porreres’ coat of arms is vibrant, with orange and green for the tree, black for the birds, and set against a white background. In contrast, Meghan’s logo uses a more muted white and blue colour scheme.\n",

There were 477 stolen last week - they cost £4.50 each.\"  \t This amount would mean a total of £2,146.50 which Ramsay has lost financially during one week.  \t Reflecting on his more than 80 restaurants globally, he said: \"It does get a bit scary, in terms of how big it is and the global impact.  The team are incredible and there are some amazing chefs throughout.  \t \"Opening in 1998 Restaurant Gordon Ramsay, I would never have thought it would be here today - this year we celebrated 24 years at three star Michelin.\"  \t Elsewhere, Ramsay spoke about the upcoming nuptials of his daughter, Holly Ramsay, and Olympic swimmer Adam Peaty - saying they are planning a \"Christmas wedding\".  \t He said that Peaty, who competed on the 19th series of Strictly Come Dancing, did not seek his permission but did talk to him about the engagement.  \t Ramsay said: \"He's (Adam) so down to earth and so focused and disciplined. He sat us down in Cornwall.   \"He said 'Holly is just the perfect woman. I'd like to get your blessing - from you and Tana for her hand in marriage'. It was that sort of amazing moment. Everything went quiet. As a future son-in-law, we couldn't ask for anyone better.\"  \t YouTuber Holly and the three-time Olympic gold medal winner announced their engagement in September, shortly after he returned to competing for the Paris Olympics, earning a silver medal.  \t Last year, Ramsay's pub in the York & Albany near Regent's Park, north London was taken over by squatters, before they later left.  \t The Jonathan Ross Show also sees former EastEnders actor Danny Dyer, Ugly Betty star Vanessa Williams, Babygirl actor Harris Dickinson, Olympic runner Keely Hodgkinson and singer Joan Armatrading on the show.  \t The City Of London Police has confirmed it has not received any reports of theft from the restaurant.  \t\n",

Now, the indie pop star has issued a fresh health update to supporters at a gig in Munich, Germany. He told the crowd in the video obtain by The Sun: “I saw the doctor today and he said you need to stay off your feet as much as you can otherwise you’ll lose your toes.” Doherty had previously been seen wearing slippers or socks on stage.

The former heroin addict told Guardian's Saturday magazine, he shared: \"I gave up the main poisons and my health improved. \"Then you get told alcohol and cheese and sugar are just as bad and you were healthier when you were on heroin.” Doherty described himself as \"a bit of a glutton”, adding that “It's not a joke, I’ve been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and at the moment I'm lacking the discipline to tackle cholesterol.” The singer is said to have been sober since 2019 but his health issues have persisted. Doherty gave up hard drugs several years ago, but has said that he did not think that he would live very long, due to his previous lifestyle. He told the Evening Standard: “I have seen a liver doctor who says I need to change my diet — too much cheese, too much milk.  \"But the cheese is so good, that’s part of the reason I stay here… It’s a cholesterol and diabetes thing now, but there are tablets, it makes a big difference.\" Doherty is married to Katia de Vidas, with whom he performs in the band Puta Madres. They have a daughter together, and Doherty also has two children from previous relationships. The Libertines released their fourth studio album, All Quiet on the Eastern Esplanade, on March 29, 2024, their first studio released in nine years.\n",

The verdict, which was delivered by the jury on Tuesday, came after the rapper was charged with two felony counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm.  Prosecutors had argued that the hip-hop star shot at Terell Ephron during a dispute in 2021.

But their relationship broke down, with Rocky's fame cited as a reason for the estrangement, the court was told.

I really wanna thank the jury for making the right decision. \"I'm so thankful this is crazy right now. I'm thankful... we're blessed to be a freeman talking to all of y'all.\" The three week trial culminated in just three hours of jury deliberations, with the musician acquitted of all charges. During the trial, jurors were shown surveillance footage which prosecutors suggested was evidence of Rocky firing a gun at Ephron outside a Hollywood garage. However, Rocky's defence suggested Ephron was motivated by \"jealousy, lies and greed\" and that the gun was actually a \"starter pistol\" capable of only shooting blanks. Rocky's girlfriend, international pop star Rihanna, was in court to hear the verdict, with the singer bursting into tears and leaping to hug her boyfriend following the verdict. Ahead of the trial, the rapper reportedly turned down a final prosecution offer - with authorities proposing a guilty plea to one of his two felony counts in exchange for serving 180 days in prison.\n",

      "Buckler, who died after a short illness, was a founding member of the mod punk band in 1972, playing in the band's classic line-up alongside bass player Bruce Foxton, 69, and lead singer and guitarist Weller, 66.  \t In an Instagram post, Weller said: \"I'm shocked and saddened by Rick's passing. I'm thinking back to us all rehearsing in my bedroom in Stanley Road, Woking.  \t \"To all the pubs and clubs we played at as kids, to eventually making a record. What a journey. We went far beyond our dreams and what we made stands the test of time. My deepest sympathy to all family and friends.\"  \t With The Jam, Buckler featured on six studio albums, including In The City (1977), All Mod Cons (1978) and Sound Affects (1980), which saw the band take a more melodic approach to punk rock, incorporating soul, blues and 1960s beat influences into their music.  \t Weller also shared a tribute from Foxton on the account, which read: \"I was shocked and devastated to hear the very sad news today.  \t \"Rick was a good guy and a great drummer whose innovative drum patterns helped shape our songs.  \t \"I'm glad we had the chance to work together as much as we did.  \t \"My thoughts are with Leslie and his family at this very difficult time.\"  \t Also paying tribute was ska group The Bodysnatchers' lead singer Rhoda Dakar, whose band shot to prominence in London at about the same time as The Jam.  \t In a post on Instagram she said: \"A band is only as good as its drummer. So I would say he was a bloody good one.  \t \"My sincere condolences to his family and friends.  \t\"Don't waste a day people - tomorrow isn't promised.\"  \t Buckler was due to embark on a Q&A tour of the UK later this year entitled A Night Of Memories And Music, which was recently postponed due to his health.   The Jam achieved four UK number one singles and one UK number one album, and are best known for tracks such as Town Called Malice, Going Underground and Down In The Tube Station At Midnight.  \t The band split in 1982 and had never fully reunited, but Foxton and Buckler have played together on a number of occasions.  \t Weller and Buckler reportedly never spoke again barring a brief interaction, with the singer going on to form The Style Council after the dissolution of The Jam.  \t After The Jam ended, Buckler went on to form a number of groups including Time UK, Sharp, which also featured Foxton, and The Gift, named after The Jam's last studio album and playing music from the band's back catalogue.  \t Buckler toured with From The Jam, a new band playing covers of his first group, from 2007 to 2009, where he was joined by Foxton, who is still touring with the group.  \t A statement from his management company announcing the news read: \"Rick Buckler, best known as the legendary drummer of The Jam, passed away peacefully on Monday evening in Woking, after a short illness with family by his side.  \t Read more: United Nations judge forced woman to work as slave after tricking her to come to UK, court hears Read more: Sara Sharif's father protected by 'Muslim gang' in jail after being attacked with jagged tuna lid \"Rick was a loving husband, father and grandfather and was a devoted friend to many, who will be greatly missed.  \t \"His family have asked for privacy and respect during this time.

      "\n",
      "Officials in the Spanish village of Porreres on the island of Mallorca are reportedly considering legal action against the Duchess of Sussex after alleging she copied the town’s traditional coat of arms for the logo of her newly relaunched luxury brand named As Ever. The two images bear a striking resemblance, both featuring a single palm tree flanked by two tropical looking birds.  The Porreres’ coat of arms is vibrant, with orange and green for the tree, black for the birds, and set against a white background. In contrast, Meghan’s logo uses a more muted white and blue colour scheme. Mayor Francisca Mora told the local newspaper, Ara Balears, the similarity was \"surreal\" and the town hall is currently considering legal action. She remarked, “I don’t know if she visited agritourism sites and came across the coat of arms, because the image on her website appears to be from Mallorca.” Mayor Mora noted that the village now \"feels international\" and hopes this incident will at least raise its profile. “I hope many people around the world will become aware that in Mallorca, there is an inland town with this coat of arms,” she added.

      "A decision over the show's future will be decided after Gatwa's second season airs, it is understood. The 32-year-old is said to have already filmed his regeneration scene - as fears grow over the show being shelved after more than 60 years. It comes amid claims 'woke' storylines have been shoehorned into the latest series, resulting in bad ratings. Read more: British rock star Brian Molko charged after 'calling Italian PM a piece of s*** fascist and a Nazi' during gig Read more: Mad about the Box Office: Latest Bridget Jones installment smashes rom com record A source told The Sun: \"Ncuti doesn’t want to be tied to the series beyond this and plans to relocate to Los Angeles with several Hollywood projects standing by for him. \"His team also see a lot of fan backlash from the series, and don’t want the perception of him still being The Doctor to get in the way of any future work.  \"The show has been poorly managed in recent years and there’s a lot of people who’ve been working on this show for years and now being cast aside due to poor leadership.\" They said people had warned the episode had become \"too caught up on an agenda\" instead of focusing on \"telling a story\". Gatwa's first series, which aired last spring, attracted between 2.25 million and 3.18 million viewers. It included episodes criticising capitalism and Christianity as well as a new villain played by a drag queen. The 60th anniversary episodes, which saw the return of fan favourites David Tennant and Catherine Tate, were two million up on Gatwa's series. It comes after the BBC made a deal with Disney, believed to be worth £100 million. However, a question mark still remains on whether it will be renewed. Crew on set are understood to be outraged over the lack of clarity over the show's future. An insider told the paper: \"Word on set is that the BBC will shelve the series for at least five years. The crew were told not to hold their breath for work on the series for at least ten years.  \"As we scramble to find work, those responsible get to ride off on to other well-paid projects without any repercussions. Filming wrapped on Friday afternoon, with no fanfare or celebration.\" Gatwa's exit is expected to be the earliest since Christopher Eccleston, who left after only one series in 2005. Tennant, Matt Smith, Peter Capaldi and Jodie Whittaker all did at least three series of the show before moving on.\n",

      "\n",
      "The Placebo frontman had been performing at Italy’s Sonic Park festival 2023 ,  which local reports say drew around 5,000 people.  On Monday, Italy’s justice ministry approved a request from prosecutors to charge Molko for calling Ms Meloni a “piece of s***, fascist, racist” as well as a “Nazi”.  Prosecutors reacted to a police complaint at the Turin festival, launching an investigation into Mr Molko for defamation and contempt. Defamation in Italy can land offenders with a prison term of up to three years.  Justice minister spokesman for Carlo Nordio said a prison sentence is unlikely in this case.

It comes as Ms Meloni faces calls to bring Italy's strict defamation laws in line with international standards on freedom of expression. In 2023, the Italian PM successfully sued investigative journalist Robert Saviano after insulting her during a television interview about a baby who died while crossing the Mediterranean. The Gomorrah author called her a 'b*****' over her approach to migration and was  fined €1,000 (£830) after being found guilty of defamation.  The case prompted British author Sir Salman Rushdie to tell Meloni to 'grow up'. In another case, a Rome university professor from Wednesday was cleared of slandering Agriculture Minister Francesco Lollobrigida, Meloni’s brother-in-law and close ally, for comparing him to a Nazi governor. Donatella Di Cesare, a professor of philosophy at the Sapienza University in Rome, said following the verdict: \"This is a great victory for democracy and free debate. Critical voices must be heard.\" According to figures from the Italian press freedom organisation Ossigeno per l’informazione, over 5,000 lawsuits for defamation are filed against Italian journalists annually.  Up to 90% are typically rejected as groundless. Meloni leads the Brothers of Italy party and the right-wing coalition voted into power in 2022.  Her government is viewed as the most-wing in Italy since Mussolini in World War 2.  \"Italians have sent a clear message in favour of a right-wing government led by Brothers of Italy,\" she said after her election win.\n",

      "We're now halfway through the marathon of awards season that kicks off with the chaotic fun of the Golden Globes and ends two months later with the ultimate in awards season glory of the Oscars. \n",
      "So last night's BAFTA Awards are an interesting point at which to reflect of what's shaping up to be a pretty mixed bag of a year. Papal thriller Conclave went into the night with the most nominations - and ended it with the top two prizes of Best Film and Outstanding British Film.  Ralph Fiennes' long wait for a Best Actor BAFTA continues though as that went to Adrien Brody for his portrayal of a Hungarian architect in The Brutalist. Brady Corbet's three and a half hour magnum opus was an early awards season favourite and still a likely contender for Best Picture at the Oscars.  Brady won Best Director last night too; and told me on the red carpet he'd had to fight 'legions of people' to keep his film the length he dreamed.  The 15-minute intermission he included has proved surprisingly popular with cinema audiences though - perhaps a trend to look out for in 2025?  Read more: Conclave wins Best Film at BAFTAs as Adrien Brody named Best Actor Read more: Stars stun on the red carpet at 2025 BAFTAs Audiences might also have been a little disappointed to miss out on Demi Moore's second Best Actress acceptance speech following her headline-grabbing turn at the Golden Globes, but Anora's Mikey Madison is a worthy winner and definitely one to watch in the future. A month ago Emilia Perez was the genre-defying musical explosion of a film that everyone thought would sweep the board at awards season.  The fact that lead actress Karla Sofía Gascón was the first openly trans woman to ever be nominated for an Oscar and a BAFTA in the same month that Trump had taken office and announced his DEI rollbacks didn't hurt its chances in a Hollywood still licking its post-election wounds.  However, that was before an enterprising journalist in the States trawled back through years of her tweets and discovered she had held some pretty unsavoury views on people of colour, Muslims and even (very awkwardly for someone nominated for one) increased diversity at the Oscars.  Gascón's now been effectively erased from the Netflix awards campaign; airbrushed from the film's posters and reportedly denied funding to attend red carpets and events.  Interestingly last night though her co-star Zoe Saldana and her director Jacques Audiard both made a point of thanking her in their acceptance speeches; and her name was applauded by the room when announced in the Best Actress nominations list.  We all know how much Hollywood loves a redemptive story arc, so perhaps after some more suitably fulsome public apologies and a respectful interlude of silence that might not be the last we hear of Gascón.  The only project that perhaps had the right to feel a little snubbed last night was (so far) perennial awards season bridesmaid A Complete Unknown.  Despite star Timothee Chalamet and plus one Kylie Jenner lending their full wattage star power to the front row (even gamely joining in on a David Tennant gag at one point) the team again left empty handed despite their clutch of nominations.  The window for Oscars voting closes today; so any undecideds may have been watching for last nights' results to steer them - but with a fortnight still to go there remains no obvious frontrunners in the 2025 race.\n",

      "Conclave and The Brutalist have dominated the 2025 BAFTAs - winning four prizes each.\n",
      "The thriller Conclave - set around the process of choosing a new Pope - was named Best Film at the ceremony at the Royal Festival Hall on London's Southbank. German director Edward Berger thanked his cast including actor Ralph Fiennes, saying: \"What you did (for) me on set was magic. I'm so grateful I was able to witness (it).\" Conclave also picked up the Outstanding British Film, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Editing awards. Adrien Brody won Best Actor for his starring role in The Brutalist, set in the aftermath of the Second World War. Brady Corbet was named Best Director for the movie - which was also recognised for Best Cinematography and Best Editing. Mikey Madison took the Best Actress prize for her lead role in comedy drama Anora. Best Supporting Actor went to Kieran Culkin for A Real Pain - and Zoe Saldana was named Best Supporting Actress for musical crime epic Emilia Perez. British actor Warwick Davis was given a BAFTA fellowship - which he dedicated to his late wife. He said: \"This is the best thing that's ever happened to me and I've been in Star Wars\". Davis added that \"life has been pretty tough\" since losing Samantha at the age of 53 last March. Elsewhere, Wallace And Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl - which drew huge audiences when it was shown on TV on Christmas Day - was named Best Animated Film and Best Children's and Family Film. Director Nick Park said: \"It's such a wonderful privilege to be working at Aardman every day with such obscenely talented artists and crafts people so passionate about creativity and we're so lucky to have our fabulous cast.\" British actor David Jonsson was named winner of the EE Rising Star category. The 31-year-old - who recently starred in Alien: Romulus - said \"I've got to be honest, this isn't why I do it. I'm just an east London boy.\" \"I didn't really see a space for me in this industry. But this award is about people and as long as we can keep telling stories about people I think there's got to be a space for me.\" The ceremony was hosted - for the second time - by former Doctor Who star David Tennant. He kicked off the awards with a sketch, showing him in his dressing room wife wife Georgia Tennant - before fellow Scottish star Brian Cox sang a reworking of The Proclaimers hit \"I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)\".

      "The 78th BAFTAs have been held in London this evening - with a host of A-list stars taking their place on the red carpet.\n",
      "David Tennant hosted the ceremony for the second time at the Royal Festival Hall. He kicked off the awards with a sketch, showing him in his dressing room with wife Georgia Tennant. He called on the \"Bafta gods\" to help him, getting messages from fellow Scottish actor Brian Cox, who started singing a remade version of The Proclaimers hit \"I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)\". Tennant wore a kilt as he walked into the event hall, which included him saying \"I'm going to work hard for you, Selena\" Gomez, while touching the US actress on the shoulder. Timothee Chalamet was spotted in the audience alongside his partner Kylie Jenner. The 29-year-old was nominated in the leading actor category for his role in Bob Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown. Cynthia Erivo, Mikey Madison and Demi Moore were all up for Lead Actress for their roles in Wicked, Anora and The Substance respectively. Ariana Grande faced Selena Gomez and Emilia Perez for supporting actress. Wallace and Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl was nominated in the Animated Film category. Stars Ralph Fiennes, Sebastian Stan, Zoe Saldana and Hugh Grant were also up for prizes. The Brutalist, Conclave and Bob Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown contested Best Film. Jeff Goldblum arrived on the red carpet early for the awards. Goldblum, 72, stars as the Wonderful Wizard of Oz in the multi-award nominated film based on the West End and Broadway musical Wicked. He was due to play the piano during the 'In Memoriam' section of the awards. Chief executive of Bafta Jane Millichip said it had been an amazing year for British film. She went on: \"If you look at the best British category this year, it's an amazing array of really small character pieces. \"It's an extraordinary category with films like Bird, Blitz and Gladiator 2.\" She added that it was \"incredibly important\" to have films not in the English language like Kneecap and Emilia Perez. \"It's fantastic to have a film in the Irish language like Kneecap.\" Stacy Martin, who stars in multi-nominated film The Brutalist, said the most amazing thing about the movie is that it's been made by \"a family of friends\". Martin, who plays Maggie Lee in the post-Second World War picture, told PA: \"Even though the scope of the film was very big, there were lots of very strong friendships and strong collaborations happening, so you're kind of more free and less intimidated to dive in.\" The French actress said she loved portraying such a \"beautiful and promising\" character who could achieve whatever she wanted. She said that while the film explores themes of the Holocaust it tackles themes that are still relevant today. \"I think that having a bit of distance, but also being able to relate to certain themes, I think, has made some of it quite poignant and quite modern in a way,\" she said. British actor Warwick Davis, who was set to pick up the Bafta Fellowship, said he learned about his award while checking emails on the toilet. The Harry Potter star told PA: \"I found out last November, I was actually on the toilet reading my emails and received one from Bafta, with a letter attached, saying: \"You've been awarded a fellowship.\" \"I was excited but thought 'hang on, it could be a scam', so I checked the email address it come from, and it was indeed a Bafta email address. \"Then I got very excited and jumped off the loo and ran around the house telling the kids and the dog.\" Davis - who was born with spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita, a rare bone disorder that results in dwarfism - said he hopes his award is also for his work as an actor as well as his activism. \"If I can have a sneaky bit of this Bafta for my performance work as well my advocacy, I'd be delighted.\"\n",

She wrote: 'I had an accident yesterday on May 18, around 8 am in Gangnam, I made a big mistake by being drunk at that time.

      "Flack, who was also known for presenting ITV's Love Island, took her own life on February 15 2020 at the age of 40. On Saturday, Whitmore, 39, shared screenshots of messages that showed her telling Flack she had just been offered the presenting role on the ITV series. In the messages, Flack said it was \"perfect\" that Whitmore would be doing the show alongside her husband Iain Stirling, who narrates the series, and followed up this message with a series of love hearts. Flack hosted the reality dating show between 2015 and 2019 with Whitmore taking the reigns in 2020 and leaving the role in 2022.

It really hit me hard. \"Looking at messages I've never publicly shared as they were private messages. Media outlets wrote a lot far from the actual truth. \"I think they show a side to Caroline which is nice to remember. Hence I'm sharing now.\" Whitmore said she had met Flack when she took over hosting duties for I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! NOW!. \"She was as supportive of me doing that role back then as she was when she supported me doing Love Island in 2020,\" she said. \"Both were great shows with hundreds of people working on them and relying on the show going ahead. \"I will always be so thankful of the last messages between me and Caroline.\" She continued: \"Every time I've been asked to speak about the situation or be part of a documentary I decline. \"I've already said all I can say on the tragedy and don't want words to be misconstrued and need to look after my own mental health. \"This was the last correspondence I ever had with her.\" \"The last message from her to me were love hearts,\" she said. \"I'd like to think wherever she is now, she's at peace and somewhere lovely like I hoped. \"I'm sad when I see the press and social media be so divisive and that we still haven't learned from Caroline's treatment before her death when it comes to women in the spotlight. \"Today I choose to remember these messages and thank the cloud for giving them back to me.\" After Flack's death, a coroner ruled she took her own life after learning prosecutors were going to press ahead with an assault charge over an incident involving her boyfriend, Lewis Burton.

      "The woman who said she was raped by rappers and business moguls Jay-Z and Sean \"Diddy\" Combs in 2000, when she was 13, has dropped her civil lawsuit against both men.\n",
      "A federal court filing on Friday said the woman, referred to as Jane Doe to protect her identity, voluntarily withdrew the case with prejudice, which means she cannot bring it again. Both Diddy - who is currently jailed in New York awaiting trial for multiple charges including sex trafficking - and Jay-Z have consistently denied the claims. Jay-Z, real name Shawn Carter, quickly released a statement after the lawsuit was dismissed, in which he said: “Today is a victory.” The billionaire rapper added: “The frivolous, fictitious and appalling allegations have been dismissed. This civil suit was without merit and never going anywhere.” Read more: One Direction star Liam Payne was 'sectioned' after near-fatal overdose months before death, close friend claims “The fictional tale they created was laughable, if not for the seriousness of the claims. I would not wish this experience on anyone,” he concluded. The unidentified woman, from Alabama, had accused Jay-Z and Diddy of raping her after the MTV VMA awards in New York, in 2000. The woman claimed that she was driven to a house party by a driver hired by Diddy, where she was allegedly given a drink that made her \"woozy\".

An unnamed female celebrity was also said to have held her down. The court document submitted by the woman's lawyers announcing the voluntary dismissal of the case did not give a reason for why it was withdrawn. Diddy still faces dozens of sexual assault lawsuits, many of which were filed by the plaintiff's lawyer, Tony Buzbee, a Texas attorney who says his firm represents over 150 men and women, who allege sexual abuse and exploitation by Combs. The lawsuits allege many individuals were abused at parties hosted by Diddy in New York, California and Florida after receiving drug-laced drinks. Lawyers for Combs said the dismissal of the lawsuit without a settlement confirmed that other lawsuits he is facing are built on falsehoods. \"For months, we have seen case after case filed by individuals hiding behind anonymity, pushed forward by an attorney more focused on media headlines than legal merit. Just like this claim, the others will fall apart because there is no truth to them,\" they said in a statement, adding that Combs \"has never sexually assaulted or trafficked anyone - man or woman, adult or minor\". When asked for a response, Mr Buzbee responded \"no comment\" in an email Friday night. Statements from both rappers derisively referred to Mr Buzbee and his firm as the \"1-800-lawyer\", after he set up a hotline for people to make allegations against Diddy. Jay-Z accused him of \"hiding behind Jane Doe\" for financial gain. \"When they quickly realise that the money grab is going to fail, they get to walk away with no repercussions,\" he wrote. \"The system has failed.\" Jay-Z, who is married to Beyonce, with whom he has three children, previously said the claims amounted to blackmail, adding that he was heartbroken for his family. Jay-Z and Combs are part of a generation of hip-hop titans who rose to prominence in the 2000s, emerging as wide-ranging entrepreneurs and two of the world's wealthiest rappers.\n",

      "Lesley Joseph refuses to talk about Pauline Quirke's dementia on Good Morning Britain as it's 'private', but praised her co-star as a 'joy'.\n",
      "Lesley Joseph, 79, shut down questions on Pauline Quirke's dementia on Good Morning Britain on Friday. Presenters Charlotte Hawkins and Robert Rinder asked how Joseph's 'Birds of A Feather' co-star was doing since her dementia diagnosis became public. She said: \"I have to say what a wonderful actress she is. What a joy she has given.  \"Not just in Birds Of A Feather, in Broadchurch, in Emmerdale, I take my hat off to Pauline Quirke.  \"She's amazing. I wont talk about her at the moment, her illness, that's private.\" This comes as a friend revealed that Pauline Quirke is 'struggling to identify her family members' due to dementia. The 65-year-old rose to fame for her iconic role as Sharon Theodopolopodous in the long-running sitcom Birds of a Feather, winning a British Comedy Award for her performance. She also starred in Broadchurch, Emmerdale and The Sculptress. However, Quirke has since stepped back from acting, following her diagnosis of dementia in 2021. Birds of a Feather writer Maurice Gran said that Lesley Joseph, who appeared alongside Quirke on the show, had rung him before the retirement announcement last month.

Initially, she felt she was beginning to lose her grip. Now, we understand she struggles to identify members of her own family.\" Announcing her retirement in January, Quirke's husband said in a statement: \"It is with a heavy heart that I announce my wife Pauline's decision to step back from all professional and commercial duties due to her diagnosis of Dementia in 2021. \"Pauline has been an inspiration through her work in the film and TV industry, her charity endeavours and as the founder of the very successful Pauline Quirke Academy of Performing Arts (PQA). \"Her talent, dedication, and vision have touched countless lives and will continue to do so through the legacy of her work and through PQA where her vision and guidance has facilitated many young peoples’ progression and interest in the Arts and enhanced their self-confidence.\" In 2022, Quirke was awarded an MBE, recognising her dedication to charitable causes, contributions to the entertainment industry and work with young people.\n",

      "The actress, 33, died in 2020 while rescuing her son Josey from Lake Piru in California. Josey, who was four at the time, told police she had boosted him on to the deck. However, she did not have enough energy to save herself, local police said at the time. Rivera's ex-boyfriend - and Josey's father - Ryan Dorsey has now revealed what her final words were before drowning. \"The last thing she said was his [Josey's] name, and then she went under, and he didn't see her anymore,\" he said. He said his son had initially been scared to get in the water but Rivera said: \"Don't be silly!\" Read more: Glee star Naya Rivera's death declared an accident by medical examiner Read more: Body found in search for Glee star Naya Rivera belongs to actress, local police say Opening up more about the traumatic experience, Dorsey told People: \"Something [Josey's] said over and over is that he was trying to find a life raft, and there was a rope, but there was a big spider on the rope, and he was too scared to throw it.\" \"I keep reassuring him, 'buddy, that rope wasn't going to be long enough.'\" He added: \"It just rocks my world that he had to witness her last moments.\" Dorsey said he first found out that Rivera had gone missing when he received a call from her stepfather in the middle of a supermarket. \"I collapsed into a pallet of drinks,\" Dorsey said. \"I feared the worst.\" He said he immediately got in his car and drove 145 miles to Lake Piru. \"I drove 100-and-­something the whole way with my four-way hazards on, chain-smoking cigarettes - and I don't even smoke, really - and just crying,\" he said. \"I just wanted to get to Josey. \"If we'd have lost both Naya and Josey, I don't know how I would continue on with my life.\" He added: \"When it happened, I just found myself shaking my head, like, I can't believe she's gone. It's still so surreal every day.\" Five years on, the holidays are particularly hard for Josey to face. \"We made this book of memories for Josey that sits by his bed, and during the holidays he was crying looking at it,\" Dorsey said. \"You can only give him a hug and tell him, 'I know, life is not fair. Bad things happen and there's no reason for it, and you just have to do your best to be a good person.'\"\n",

      "\n",
      "In the case of Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, it seems that the answer is very little.    This is not a borderline case. There can be no debate about Ye: he clearly hates Jewish people. This is not his first time.  In 2022, Adidas was forced to end its partnership with him following our petition, which quickly gained over 180,000 signatures and helped the company to find the wherewithal to end its lucrative partnership.  The posts that Ye published last week could not have been more extreme—yet the world of entertainment seems content to continue working with him and hosting him at its events.   Had Ye been posting from the UK or Europe, he’d have been committing a criminal offence, but in the US, free speech is close to absolute under the First Amendment.  The premise of the First Amendment has always been that it is better to debate and condemn extremists and bigots rather than silence them.  But that only works if people actually debate and condemn.  For the famously vocal world of entertainment, the hushed response to Ye declaring that he is a Nazi and that Jewish people should all be slaves is disturbing.   We might charitably call it a blind spot, but really it is worse than that; it is a double standard.  In a society that defends free speech, even when it constitutes incitement, this silence is dangerous.  It leaves a radicalising racist like Ye free to spout his vitriol and poison minds practically unchallenged.  Online platforms like X provide Ye with a mega stage to spew his Jew-hating rhetoric.  For those who dismiss his words as mere ramblings that the masses will ignore: Ye has twice as many followers on X as there are Jewish people in the world. And just to prove that he knows he can get away with it, he proceeded to launch a t-shirt emblazoned with a swastika on his website.  This is a symbol forever associated with the industrial slaughter of six million Jewish men, women, and children. In response, together with The Houmous Foundation, we have launched our own t-shirts emblazoned with the Star of David—a symbol of resilience and pride.  Every purchase is a statement: We will not be intimidated. We will not be silent. It would be nice to see the eagerly virtue-signalling celebrities of the world wearing one — it might be easier since they seem to have trouble speaking out. ________________ Gideon Falter is Chief Executive of Campaign Against Antisemitism.

One scene sees Ted, played by Dermot Morgan, appear to mock the Chinese by wearing a lampshade on his head. There is a later reference to Hitler, with an unfortunately-placed mark and some dramatic arm gestures.

      "Liam Payne's former fiancee has revealed the extent of his struggle with serious drug abuse, months after the One Direction star's death in Argentina.\n",
      "Maya Henry said that Payne had smoked heroin, sexted with fans and struggled with his identity during their relationship. The One Direction star died aged 31 on October 16 after falling from the third-floor balcony of his Buenos Aires hotel. Payne and Henry were together from 2019 and got engaged in 2020. They split up in 2021 before getting engaged again later that year. They ended their relationship a second and last time in May 2022. Henry, 25, told Rolling Stone magazine that \"it was the drug use and addictions that tore us apart.\" She added in a statement: \"Anyone who has been with an addict understands how difficult that is.  \"While I loved him deeply, he did things that hurt me in ways I'll never fully understand, and he continued to hurt me years after we broke up.\" Henry was criticised unfairly by fans after Payne's death, as it emerged that she had taken legal steps to prevent him contacting her. She said he had been bombarding her with messages, including from different phone numbers. A source close to the singer said: \"It was normal for Liam to do cocaine, ketamine, MDMA, and pharmaceutical pills (Xanax and pain pills). Then he got into smoking heroin.\" He was \"seeking out drugs, sexting fans, and hiring sex workers,\" according to the source. Henry added: \"'I knew there were parts of himself he was struggling with — parts of his identity he wasn't ready to fully face, even within our relationship.\" At the time of his death, Payne had been staying in Argentina with girlfriend Kate Cassidy, who flew back to America shortly before he died. In one of Cassidy's only interviews since the star's death, she revealed last week: \"I had a responsibility, we had a responsibility.  She went on to share: \"We had our dog and obviously I never, ever thought this event would occur.\" \"It was a tragic accident and no, I never did think (he might die young). But, you know, we did have our own separate lives - this wasn't the first time we have travelled separately. \"I just never thought this would have happened, that it would turn out the way it did.\" It comes as Miss Cassidy reflected on the moment she learned of the singer's death, adding: \"it still doesn't feel fully real for me that he's not here\".   Speaking to The Sun, she said: \"Love is so optimistic, and you just hope that everything will work out at the end. \"Obviously if I knew, if I could see into the future, I would never have left Argentina.\" Read more: Bianca Censori 'wanted to back out of naked Grammys stunt - but Kanye West insisted' Read more: Chelsea striker Sam Kerr says police treated her differently due to skin colour in star's harassment trial Payne's death prompted vigils across the globe and the star was recently remembered during the In Memoriam segment of the Grammy Awards. \"It still doesn't feel fully real for me that he's not here\", Cassidy added. \"I'm trying to be the best I can be, but I feel like my life has changed so much. I think about Liam every second of every day. \"From the moment I met Liam, I genuinely believed we were soulmates; he was the most humble, charming, normal person you could ever hope to come across, and genuinely one of the best people I've ever met in my life. \"That he won't be there with me to navigate through this life, that I'll have to deal with this without him by my side... it's really hard. \"You don't think about the worst possible thing that can happen.\" On the moment she heard of Liam's death, she said: \"I feel blessed I didn't find out over social media because I just couldn't even imagine that. I was in our home with our dog, scrolling TikTok and one of Liam's friends called me.  \t \"That moment, it's like blank; it's blacked out in my head.  \"I didn't believe it at first. I thought it was just a rumour. Or something that somebody made up just to get views. \"Then instantly I just had a bad feeling in my gut. I was like, 'Why would somebody make this up? Is this true?' \"And I feel like I just completely blacked out. When I officially found the news out to be true, I felt numb. I tried to call him. I called pretty much everybody. \"Then I was in touch with his family, and my mum got the first flight out to be with me. I remember pacing around the house - poor Nala (her dog) thought I was trying to play, she kept jumping up at me. I didn't sleep at all that night.\" She added: \"Liam was in such a good headspace when I left Argentina. \"We were in such a great place, just full of love; he was so happy and positive. And I just can't even believe the way things truly ended. \"It's genuinely insane to me how things can just be taken away from you so quickly in life, you never truly know what tomorrow will bring, you never know.\" Five people have been charged in Argentina in connection with the death, three with manslaughter and two with supplying cocaine. The British musician died from \"polytrauma\", meaning multiple traumatic injuries. Payne's funeral, held in November in Buckinghamshire, was attended by Cheryl, the mother of his son Bear, and fellow One Direction stars Harry Styles, Zayn Malik, Niall Horan and Louis Tomlinson, along with his family and friends. After his band went on hiatus he launched a successful solo career, releasing his debut solo album LP1 in December 2019, which included the songs Polaroid and Strip That Down featuring Quavo, as well as the track For You with Rita Ora.\n",

The 51-year-old stated that there comes a point when it is \"unfair\" to the paying crowd and defended referring to one of the hecklers as Emmerdale actress Lisa Riley before she was kicked out. Good Morning Britain hosts Susanna Reid and Ed Balls said Kay explained he had no choice but to remove the hecklers, as they were ruining the experience for others. In his full statement, he explained: \"'There comes a point when dealing with repeated hecklers simply isn't enough.  \"It's not something you ever want to do but it becomes a point when it's no longer fair to everyone around.\" Lisa Riley, the actress who was mistaken for one of the hecklers, showed her support for Kay She shared a \"Keep Calm and Laugh\" post to Instagram. On her story, she said \"PLEASE draw a line under this now, I am not offended, never was offended. \"I love Peter Kay to pieces. Laughter is my favourite medicine,\" she added. One of the hecklers, Philip Peters, 54, and his son, 26, were ejected from the venue, with Peters later claiming he was treated \"like a terrorist\" by the security who escorted him out, according to the MailOnline. He defended himself and stated all he did was shout \"garlic bread,\" but others in the audience defended the much-loved comedian, stating Peters was ruining the show.  Initially, Peters' shout was met with amusement from Kay, as his face was shown on camera for the crowd.

He described being dragged out like \"ragged dolls\" and said he was left with bruises. \n",

      "The rapper, who has been criticised for overt anti-Semitism online and praise for Adolf Hitler, appeared lying down in the advert during Sunday's flagship annual American football game. Fox, where the game was shown, is facing questions over how the advert was allowed to be broadcast. West said in the advert, which was shot from a dentist's chair: \"I spent all the money for the commercial on these new teeth, so once again I had to shoot it on the iPhone... go to Yeezy.com\". The only item for sale on that website is a white t-shirt with a swastika on the front. The listing also has the code \"HH-01\", which is likely to be a reference to \"Heil Hitler\".

The swastika is the symbol adopted by Hitler as the primary emblem of the Nazis.  \"It galvanized his followers in the 20th century and continues to threaten and instill fear in those targeted by antisemitism and white supremacy. \"If that wasn’t enough, the t-shirt is labeled on Kanye’s website as “HH-01,” which is code for “Heil Hitler.” \"Kanye was tweeting vile antisemitism nonstop since last week. There’s no excuse for this kind of behavior. Even worse, Kanye advertised his website during the Super Bowl, amplifying it beyond his already massive social media audience\". The rapper, who is now known as Ye, was ejected from Twitter on Monday after continually posting tweets of an antisemitic nature and describing slavery as \"a choice\" from Thursday evening to Friday afternoon. He said: \"I'm logging out of Twitter. I appreciate Elon for allowing me to vent. \"It has been very cathartic to use the world as a sounding board. It was like an Ayahuasca trip.\" \"Love all of you who gave me your energy and attention. To we connect again. Good afternoon and goodnight.\" A spokesperson for the Campaign Against Antisemitism said earlier: \"Once again, Ye has gone on an antisemitic rampage online. It couldn't be any clearer that he is an unrepentant, proud antisemite.\" The move came after West made a number of antisemitic remarks including praising Hitler in a conversation with US conspiracy theorist Alex Jones that year.  \t In a video obtained by US outlet TMZ in 2023, West was also seen making a series of incoherent statements, including references to Jews and Zionists.  \t Following the remarks, he issued an apology in Hebrew on Instagram, which read: \"I sincerely apologise to the Jewish community for any unintended outburst caused by my words or actions.  \t \"It was not my intention to hurt or demean, and I deeply regret any pain I may have caused.\"  \t He added: \"Your forgiveness is important to me, and I am committed to making amends and promoting unity.\"\n",

      "Legendary strongman Geoff Capes left nearly £240,000 in his will and a last request to have the words “Local Boy Done Good” inscribed on his gravestone.\n",
      "The former Olympic athlete, who died in hospital aged 75 last October, had an illustrious career as a sportsman and TV personality. Capes still holds the official record for the longest shot put by a British man and twice won gold in the event at the Commonwealth Games and the European Indoor Championships. Probate records have now revealed that Capes of Stoke Rochford, Lincolnshire, left his family £244,462, reduced to a net estate of £239,240. His will stated that the bulk of his estate should be left with his second wife Kashmiro Davi, who lived with him before his death. Capes also stated that his granddaughter should choose one item from his collection of medals and trophies, with the rest of them split between two grandsons. He left a Lalique vase to his daughter Emma Boelemar and his grandfather clock to his son Lewis Capes, both from his marriage to his first wife. His will also stated that he be cremated following a service at a crematorium and that \"the inscription 'Local Boy Done Good' shall be placed on my headstone”. Capes competed in three Olympic Games, and came closest to winning a medal with a fifth-place finish at the 1980 Games in Moscow. Capes, who was 6ft 5.5ins tall and weighed 26 stone in his prime, was also a six-time champion at the World Highland Games, making him the most successful competitor in the event's history. His victories in the World's Strongest Man event, which made him a household name, came in 1983 in Christchurch, New Zealand, and 1985 in Cascais, Portugal. But he was also renowned for his love of budgerigars and became known as one of the world's finest breeders of the cage birds.

But he was forced to resign before the 1980 Olympics in Moscow after “political pressure” to boycott the Games following Russia's invasion of Afghanistan. Capes had to quit the force after Margaret Thatcher banned all members of the services including the Army and the police, from competing in protest at the Russian invasion.\n",

Kaleb, 26, wrote: \"Very excited to announce that's baby Cooper number 3 is cooking…. Going to be a very very busy August.\" Keleb and Taya are parents to Oscar, three and Willa, nineteen-months. The couple have been together for eight years. Kaleb told The Times Magazine how he struggled to watch Taya give birth. He said: \"It was f***ing terrible, because when I'm helping that cow, I know exactly what I'm doing. I can bring the calf around to the mum and so on. \"Now, when Taya was giving birth, I felt useless. I'm seeing her in pain having one of my kids.\" He said that they decided to have children early in life, rather than wait. He continued: \"I wanted a girl and boy, which I've got and am very grateful. \"Then when I get older I can go down the pub with them, or out on the tractors, and I can still be energetic. \"I'll make all the money now, hopefully have a farm, then chill out, go partying and be in Ibiza, though I can't think of anything worse than being in a nightclub.\"\n",

      "Delivering an address to Parliament on Tuesday, Sir Keir Starmer announced a boost in UK defence spending to 2.5 per cent of GDP by 2027. \n",
      "This bombshell announcement comes ahead of crucial talks with Donald Trump in Washington later this week.  Sir Keir said Britain should be proud of its support for Ukraine in the wake of Putin's invasion but must do more as tensions rise across Europe. To pay for this £13.4 billion defence hike, Labour will slash foreign aid, just one of the many \"hard choices\" Britain will face in the coming years, Starmer said.  \"Russia is a menace in our waters, in our airspace and on our streets,\" he told the Commons.  He added: \"We must find courage in our history, courage in who we are as a nation, because courage is what our own era now demands of us. Read more: UK should spend 3% of GDP on defence and could send up to 10,000 troops to Ukraine, Boris Johnson tells LBC \"So starting today, I can announce this Government will begin the biggest sustained increase in defence spending since the end of the Cold War. \"We will deliver our commitment to spend 2.5%. of GDP on defence, but we will bring it forward so that we reach that level in 2027, and we will maintain that for the rest of this Parliament. \"And let me spell it out, that means spending £13.4 billion more on defence every year from 2027.\" Even this is not far enough, Starmer continued as he pledged to raise spending to 3 per cent of GDP by the next Parliament.  \"At moments like these in our past Britain has stood up to be counted, it has come together and demonstrated strength. \"That is what the security of our country needs now and it is what we will deliver\" Starmer warned \"tyrants\" like Russian President Vladimir Putin \"only respond to strength\". He told MPs: \"We should not pretend that any of this has been easy. Working people have already felt the cost of Russian actions through rising prices and bills.  \"Nonetheless, one of the great lessons of our history is that instability in Europe will always wash up on our shores, and that tyrants like Putin only respond to strength. \"Russia is a menace in our waters, in our airspace and on our streets. They have launched cyber attacks on our NHS, only seven years ago a chemical weapons attack on the streets of Salisbury. \"We must stand by Ukraine, because if we do not achieve a lasting peace, then the economic instability are threats to our security, they will only grow. \"And so as the nature of that conflict changes, as it has in recent weeks, it brings our response into sharper focus, a new era that we must meet as we have so often in the past, together, and with strength.\" The British people may face hard choices to pay for this defence hike, the PM warned.  \"I equally want to be very clear that like any other investment we make, we must seek value for money and that's why we're putting in place a new defence, reform and efficiency plan, jointly led by my right honourable friends the Chancellor (Rachel Reeves) and the Defence Secretary (John Healey). \"This investment means that the UK will strengthen its position as a leader in Nato and in the collective defence of our continent, and we should welcome that role. \"It is good for our national security. It is also good for the defining mission of this Government - to restore growth to our economy.\" This bombshell commitment comes ahead of crucial talks with President Trump later this week.  The meeting is backdropped by rising tensions in Europe, with the US seemingly abandoning its commitments to NATO and Ukraine since Trump took office.  Tory leader Kemi Badenoch urged Sir Keir Starmer to avoid tax rises or borrowing more money to fund the defence budget. She told the Commons: \"Can the Prime Minister say in confidence that 2.5% by 2027 is sufficient because we need to look at exactly how we fund this. \"He must not raise taxes further as it will destroy our economy, we need a strong economy to pay for strong defence.  \t\"He cannot borrow more, we are already spending more on debt interest than defence. We all know that he must make difficult decisions on spending, he has our support to do that.\"\n",

      "Police said they were called to 32 Portland Place, known for notorious sex parties, at 7am on Sunday morning following reports of an assault. A group of men used knives to stab party-goers during the fight, according to The Sun. The mansion is where OnlyFans star Bonnie Blue recently slept with more than 1,000 men in 12 hours. A source told The Sun: “There was blood everywhere with people lying injured all over the place. “It looked like a battle scene rather than a sex club.” Met officers attended along with the London Ambulance service and four people were taken to hospital. Three of the victims had been stabbed, police said. Their injuries are not believed to be life threatening. Three men were arrested, one on suspicion of GBH and possession with intent to supply, one man on suspicion of GBH and another man on suspicion of possession with intent to supply.  Police said they had imposed a Section 76 Closure Notice “to prevent further disruption to the local area,” which allows them to shutter the property for up to 48 hours.

Magistrates were told last year that police had been dispatched to the address 63 times over the last few years. Neighbours have said they have suffered years of extremely loud music, revellers taking drugs and vomiting in the street. Last December, Davenport flew back from Thailand to successfully challenge the closure order at City of London Magistrates’ Court. He denies hosting all-night parties, saying he hosts art shows there every months with around 100 people, but that gatherings do not go on beyond midnight. He also denied any drug-taking at the mansion. “I am very anti-drugs, I don’t drink, I have had two kidney transplants,” he said. “Nobody would be smoking marijuana in my house. “I am absolutely certain there is no illegal activity (at the parties).” Magistrate Mr Gowlett said at the time: “We do not find the case for closure has been proved on balance of probability, and therefore refuse the order that is sought.”\n",

Around 2% of children and 0.5% of adults in the UK have a tree nut allergy, according to Allergy UK.

The affected batches of Cheshire Farm's 1L Biscoff Ice Cream tubs are under codes L23139, with a best before date of 19 November, 2024, and L23261, with a best before date of 18 March, 2025. The affected batch of Caramelized Biscuit Ice Cream was sold under the code L24150, with the best before date of 29 November, 2025. Cheshire Farm said that anyone who had bought these products should not eat them if they have a nut allergy, and instead should take them back to the shop for a refund. The company warned: \"If you have bought the above products and have an allergy to nuts do not eat them.\" Cheshire Farm also said it did not have any affiliation with the Lotus Biscoff brand and its ice cream does not contain any Biscoff products.\n",

      "The Gunners head to Nottingham Forest on Wednesday 11 points adrift of Liverpool following the Reds' weekend victory at Manchester City, a day after Arteta's side slumped to a 1-0 loss against West Ham at the Emirates. Following the defeat to the Hammers - after which he criticised his players for failing to reach the standards required to end the club's 21-year wait for the title - Arteta conceded the championship race was no longer in his hands. Read More: Galatasaray accuse Fenerbahce boss Jose Mourinho of making 'racist statements' Read More: Moise Kean update after ex-Everton star rushed to hospital after collapsing on the pitch But speaking on the eve of Arsenal's trip to third-placed Forest, the Spaniard said: \"I'm not going to stop, over my dead body. \"If I think that way, I'll go home. Mathematically, it's possible. You are there. You have to play every game. Suddenly, three days ago, we could close the gap to five points. It doesn't matter. We have to continue to go. \"The difficulty is higher than it was. But if you want to win the the Premier League, you're going to have to do something special. You're probably going to have to do something that nobody else has done in the history of the Premier League.\" Arsenal's bid to win the title has been derailed by a series of injuries, with Kai Havertz and Gabriel Jesus out for the season. Bukayo Saka is due to return next month having been sidelined since December, while Gabriel Martinelli is also currently unavailable. Captain Martin Odegaard missed 12 games with an ankle injury earlier in the campaign, while Arsenal have also battled suspensions. Five players have been sent off in their 26 league games so far. The Gunners have been Liverpool's closest challengers this season, and have progressed to the last 16 of the Champions League, but Arteta believes his side could easily have been dumped out of Europe and left battling in mid-table. He continued: \"If somebody tells you at the start of the season, by this time, you have played five times with a red card over half an hour in each of those games, and you have lost this amount of players, what's the bet? You are in the middle of the table, at least, and you are out of the Champions League. \"That's not the situation. So that tells you the resilience, the resources, the ambition that the team has, every individual has, and that has been probably been one of the proudest moments in my time to work. \"It was a very disappointing weekend. In the previous 15 games, we have won 10 and drawn five, exactly the same as Liverpool, with exactly the same goal difference, which is plus 23. \"We have been extremely consistent for the last three and a half months, considering everything that we've been through, and we have generated that momentum. \"When you are trying to build that momentum and we're putting so much into it, especially with the circumstances that we have, the defeat against West Ham was a very hard one to take. On top of that, they (Liverpool) win. \"But the reality is that there's so many games to play, and you have to get back to it. You're going to have to set a certain amount of numbers to win this league.\"And we're going to have to hit that number if we're going to have any chance of doing that. But we're certainly going to continue to try.\"  \n",

      "Ms Pritchard has announced she will stand down at the end of the financial year, saying it was a \"hugely difficult decision\".  \t In a statement, she said: \"It has been an enormous privilege to lead the NHS in England through what has undoubtedly been the most difficult period in its history.  \t \"I am immensely proud of the NHS response to Covid-19, and how we have delivered steady recovery from the inevitable impacts of the pandemic, with performance in urgent and emergency care, elective and cancer all improving over the past two years, while NHS teams delivered record levels of activity in primary care, community and mental health services, meaning millions more appointments for patients.  \t \"We always knew the recovery period after a once-in-a-century pandemic was going to be incredibly challenging, and whilst the timeliness and experience of care is still not good enough for too many people, the NHS has achieved a great deal in the face of historic pressure thanks to a relentless focus on innovation and reform.  \t \"From the rollout of Community Diagnostic Centres and mental health teams in schools, to world leading cancer vaccines and the development of the App, the NHS now feels very different to when I became chief executive over three and a half years ago.  \t \"While it has been a hugely difficult decision for me to stand down, I believe now is the right time, with the NHS making continued progress in our recovery, and with the foundations firmly in place to deliver the 10-Year Health Plan.  \t \"The NHS is full of extraordinary people, who do extraordinary things every day for patients.  \"The achievements I have listed above, and many more, are theirs - and I am confident they will continue to achieve incredible things for patients now, and into the future.\" Health Secretary Wes Streeting has said Ms Pritchard should be \"enormously proud of the leadership\" she's given the NHS. \"She steered NHS England out of the pandemic, during turbulent political waters and six secretaries of state.   \"She has led with integrity and unwavering commitment,\" he added.

The former Chelsea, Manchester United, Tottenham and Real Madrid manager made comments about the Galatasaray bench \"jumping like monkeys\" after an early challenge and the match being better because it was not officiated by a Turkish referee.

The Portuguese was charged with \"unsportsmanlike behaviour towards opposing team fans\" and \"diminishing the value of Turkish football and... discrediting the impartiality of the referees and other match officials\" during an outspoken post-match interview.\n",

      "The head of Ofcom has told LBC that the regulator will \"name and shame\" social media companies that fail to protect women and girls in the UK adequately.\n",
      "Melanie Dawes, who runs the communications regulator, told LBC's Nick Ferrari at Breakfast that women face \"a real culture of misogyny, harassment [and] intimate image abuse\". She was describing Ofcom's plans to \"shine a light\" on tech companies that fail to be proactive in making their sites safer and easier to use, especially for women and girls. The regulator is consulting on new guidance on measures tech firms should use to help better protect women and girls on their sites. These will include the better use of technology to prevent intimate image abuse, as well as a request for sites to consider introducing tools which would help spot and fix ways they can be exploited by abusers. Dawes said the problem was even more widespread than some might think. \"When I talk to women, you know, what's so striking is this isn't a niche issue, this isn't about just vulnerable women, it's actually about ordinary women going about their daily lives online,\" she said. She claimed that women are \"five times more likely than men to have intimate image abuse against them, much more likely to have harassments or pile-ons just for expressing an opinion.  \"So it's fundamentally about people's freedom of speech not actually being a real thing online, if you're a woman in the UK, in the same way as it is for men.\" The guidance joins already published legally binding codes of practice on illegal content and protecting children online that have already been put in place by Ofcom. These will begin to take effect next month under the Online Safety Act, and which carry large financial penalties if found to have been breached. Dawes said it was unclear to what extent the tech firms themselves would take action when the Online Safety Act comes in, and how much Ofcom would need to enforce. \"It's a six million dollar question how much action is going to come and how much are we going to need to drive through with enforcement action,\" she said. \"We're ready for that. But this is a big cultural change for the industry. There's a lot to fix. So all eyes now on the tech industry as far as I'm concerned.\" Dawes said in an earlier statement that the new guidance was a \"call to action for online services\". \"There's not only a moral imperative for tech firms to protect the interests of female users, but it also makes sound commercial sense - fostering greater trust and engagement with a significant proportion of their customer base,\" she said.\" Dawes' colleague Jessica Smith, who led the development of the guidance, said the regulator was also prepared to use its powers under the Online Safety Act to highlight platforms not doing enough to protect women and girls on their sites through new online safety transparency reports. \"Effectively, what we are going to do is use our information-gathering and transparency powers,\" she told the PA news agency. \"So one of the things we're committing to do is, once the guidance is finalised and a sufficient period of time has passed, is we'll publish a transparency report that shines a light on what platforms are doing and not doing to keep their users safe. \"It's about putting information out there, so users can be informed and make a choice about where they spend their time online.\" She added: \"What we're saying to platforms today is that you have a commercial choice. \"We know that women spend longer online than men, for example, on a daily basis, and so we think it makes good commercial sense to take their safety seriously. \"For some platforms, they may not choose to do that, and that is their decision. But as I said, then we will make sure people know what kind of space they are entering into when they go on that kind of platform.\" Under the Online Safety Act, platforms will be legally required to follow a new set of duties around protecting users from harm online, with fines of up to 10% of global turnover for those who fail to do so - which could run into billions of pounds for the largest services. New regulation of the online world has been broadly welcomed, but some charities and campaigners have warned that the current plans have taken too long to implement, and do not go far enough to protect users from harm. In response, Ms Smith said: \"We're at the fairly early days when it comes to implementation of the Act. \"I think we're still at the stage of testing and implementing the powers that we have now, and I know that this has taken a while, so I really understand people's frustration. \"I think when it comes to this particular guidance, we are balancing quite difficult issues. There are issues around free expression.\" As well as women and girls, Ms Smith said it was vital the regulator also heard from men and boys on the issues raised. \"Obviously, this guidance is focused on women and girls, and we've spoken to a lot of survivors and women's advocacy organisations as part of the process, but it's also for men and boys - these tools can be for everybody,\" she said. \"We know boys are more exposed to online misogyny than girls are, so we think that this will have broader benefits and we're keen to speak to men and boys as part of our consultation process.\"\n",

      "Robotics company Ocean Infinity is looking for the wreckage of the plane on the seabed of the Indian Ocean, 1,200 miles off the western Australian city of Perth. Its deep-water support vessel Armada 7806 deployed autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) at the search site. These are operated via satellite from a control room at the company's headquarters in Southampton. If the wreckage is found, then Ocean Infinity can also send out remote vehicles to help recover it, also to be controled remotely. The mission may represent the last hope of finding MH370, which disappeared on March 8, 2014 after taking off from Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur for a flight to Beijing.

All 239 people who were on board are presumed dead - but none have been found, and there is no conclusive explanation for what happened. Two major search operations were launched, one from 2014-2017, and another in 2018, neither of which found the aircraft. Several pieces of debris washed up onshore in the years following the disappearance, some of which were confirmed to belong to MH370. Ocean Infinity was previously in talks with the Malaysian government for a £55 million payout if it found the wreckage, operating on a 'no-find, no-fee' basis. But no agreement is thought to have been finalised, and the Telegraph reported that the company was operating on its own account. Ocean Infinity founder Oliver Plunkett has described finding the wreckage as his life's ambition. A previous mission by the company in 2018 was abandoned without success. This mission, due to last four weeks, will focus on an arc in the southern Indian Ocean where the plane is thought to have come down. Ocean Infinity will scour up to four sites where the plane may have crashed, including one where earlier searches may not have given enough attention. The total search area is thought to be around 5,800 square miles.\n",

      "A cameraman for a controversial BBC documentary about life in Gaza has been accused of ‘celebrating’ the October 7 massacre.\n",
      "Hatem Rawagh is reported to have praised the terror attack on social media. He tweeted about the 1973 Yom Kippur war - when Egypt and Syria attacked Israel. In the post he said: “Whoever missed Oct 6 in Egypt...Oct 7 is happening in Palestine.” He went on to post online apparently celebrating the killing of an Israeli soldier.  He captioned a video of a gunman: “You are going back to this video a million times.” The video was originally posted by Hamas’s al-Qassam brigades. It depicts the point of view of a gunman killing a soldier in Erez, near the Gaza border. He also shared celebrations at the Omari mosque in Gaza in April 2023 after a car attack in Tel Aviv which killed an Italian tourist and left seven others injured.

The documentary was made by the BBC's Current Affair TV arm which paid award-winning Hoyo Films to make it. Former director of BBC television Danny Cohen said: \"The BBC needs to account for every penny spent on this documentary - £400,000 is a lot of licence-fee payers money.  \"They should be transparently told where their money went and whether any of it reached the hands of Hamas. \"The BBC must also launch a wider investigation into systemic bias against Israel after repeated editorial failures since the October 7 massacres.\" The BBC initially kept the documentary online with an added disclaimer before removing it from iPlayer while conducting further ‘due diligence’. It is co-directed by Jamie Roberts, an Emmy-award-winning filmmaker, and Yousef Hammash, a Bafta-award-winning Palestinian journalist. It was filmed by two cameramen which Mr Rawagh hired as an “additional camera.” Mr Rawagh’s tweets were uncovered by the Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting and Analysis (Camera). A spokesman for Camera said: “These posts appear to be glorifying the horrific terrorist acts committed on October 7, 2023. Anyone who wrote them has no place working for the BBC. Here is yet more evidence of the editorial failings in the documentary for which the BBC must answer.” An internal report into the programme will be presented to the BBC board on Thursday. The corporation is expected to announce a summary of findings either on Thursday or by Friday morning. According to the Telegraph, the programme was viewed by Jo Carr, the BBC’s head of current affairs, prior to broadcast. She described the documentary as a “story of immense consequence” in a press release issued on Jan 20. A BBC spokesman said: “Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone features important stories we think should be told – those of the experiences of children in Gaza. There have been continuing questions raised about the programme and in the light of these, we are conducting further due diligence with the production company. The programme will not be available on iPlayer while this is taking place.”\n",

      "Energy bills are set to rise again, with the price cap lifted by more than expected.\n",
      "Regulator Ofgem announced on Tuesday that its energy price cap would go up by 6% from 1 April, taking the typical gas and electricity bill to £1,849 per year, from £1,738. Industry onlookers had expected the price cap to rise by 5%. Ofgem said a recent spike in wholesale prices was the main driver of the price rise, accounting for around 78% of the total increase, while a small increase in policy costs and associated inflationary pressures made up a further 22%. Ofgem chief executive Jonathan Brearley said: \"We know that no price rise is ever welcome, and that the cost of energy remains a huge challenge for many households. Read more: Nearly three million more households could get energy bill discounts next winter, Labour says Read more: Landlords face £6k bill to meet higher energy efficiency targets under government plans \"But our reliance on international gas markets leads to volatile wholesale prices, and continues to drive up bills, which is why it's more important than ever that we're driving forward investment in a cleaner, homegrown system. \"Energy debts that began during the energy crisis have reached record levels and without intervention will continue to grow. This puts families under huge stress and increases costs for all customers. We're developing plans that could give households with unmanageable debt the clean slate they need to move forward. \"We welcome the Government's support for these plans, and their plans to expand the Warm Home Discount, which will also offer financial help to nearly three million more households that need it most. \"If anyone is worried about paying their bills, I would urge them to reach out to their supplier to make sure they're getting all the help they can. Where possible, switching or fixing tariffs now could also help to bring costs down and provide certainty over coming payments.\" It comes as the government said on Tuesday that it was looking to expand its financial support for energy bills. Ministers said next winter one in five families in Britain would get financial help. Around 2.7 million extra households, including nearly one million with children, would be eligible for the £150 Warm Home Discount next winter, the government added. This would bring the total number of recipient homes to an estimated 6.1 million. Responding to the price cap rise, Simon Francis, coordinator of campaign group the End Fuel Poverty Coalition, called for billions more in support for vulnerable customers. He said it is \"crucial to provide support for vulnerable households struggling with energy costs now\", calling for £13.2 billion of support at the Government's upcoming spending review. \"The big question will be how do we pay for these improvements in support. Both Warm Home Discounts and debt relief are traditionally funded through our energy bills. \"Yet the energy industry makes billions of pounds in profit every year and it beggars belief that Ofgem is increasing the profit allowance for suppliers in the current climate. \"For now, the advice for households is to make the most of existing energy efficiency schemes and if customers do shop around for a lower energy bill, they must use their own energy usage on price comparison sites.\"\n",

      "Cancer patients facing Ulez fines for travelling into London for hospital treatment are struggling to recoup the money from Transport for London despite a promise from the Mayor of London.\n",
      "Sadiq Khan had previously promised that those undergoing cancer treatment in London would be exempt from the fines, with those travelling by car able to apply for the £12.50 refund. However, some patients have been left fighting to recoup the costs after being slapped with the fines. A map showing London’s ultra-low emission zone confirmed that the charge would only apply to some patients going to their appointments. It comes as a cancer charity said three in five people are unaware that they are exempt, while others are fighting to get their money back. A spokesman for King's College hospital has said: “We have continued to submit monthly claims to Transport for London (TfL) for patients eligible for Ulez reimbursement.  'However, since the spring 2024, we have experienced difficulty in getting some claims processed. We have raised this with the TfL complaints team.” Read more: Why are women in their twenties opting for assisted dying in the Netherlands? LBC went to find out After the Mayor London expanded the plan last summer, hundreds of hospitals have been pulled into the Ulez net. LBC has contacted Transport for London for comment. TFL's terms state that patients that are too weak or disabled to travel by public transport, or who suffer from other issues  Jasmin Sarll, 30, said that during her now 4-year-old son’s cancer treatment and liver transplant, she was fined hundreds of pounds on Ulez charges. In 2022, Hugo Sarll was two years old when he was diagnosed with liver cancer and was referred to Great Ormond Street Hospital and had treatment at King’s College Hospital. During Hugo's chemotherapy Ms Sarll spent more than £250 on Ulez charges as well as nearly £100 for parking every time he needed to stay in hospital for up to three days. She told The Telegraph: “If you could plan in your head that this was going to happen, you’d get an Ulez-exempt car. But it is ridiculous.” Ms Earl was charged two £90 fines after she forgot to pay the Ulez charge, both were cancelled after charity Young Lives vs Cancer contacted TfL for her. Hugo has been in recovering for more than a year, Ms Sarll said: “We were never once told we could claim back Ulez, or obviously we would have.” Read more: ‘The whole world was spinning’: Nick Ferrari candidly recalls drink spiking as he shares 'appalling' side-effects Rachel Kirby-Rider, chief executive at Young Lives vs Cancer responded: “We know young people and families face an extra £250 a month on average to travel to treatment – treatment which is frequent and can often last years. “While young people with cancer and their families are able to claim their Ulez charges back, there is a lack of communication about what families can claim back. Our research shows 59pc of families are unaware that such schemes exist.” TfL carried out an impact assessment which revealed that the charges mean increased costs for older people, disabled people and those with underlying health conditions, who must to travel in for treatment. A TfL spokesman said: “We are very sorry for the distress that Ms Sarll has experienced.  'We had already accepted the representation she made and cancelled the penalty charges she incurred during these challenging circumstances.” A spokesman added: “We are also in contact with Ms Sarll about the Ulez charges she paid during visits to the hospital, and will refund these as a gesture of goodwill.”\n",

      "Sadiq Khan has hit out at anti-Ulez campaigners who heckled him during the annual State of London Debate, in East London.\n",
      "The mayor took 90 minutes of questions from a live audience at Indigo at the O2 on topics including housing, crime, the cost of living and transport.  Tensions ran high as the capital’s Ultra-Low Emissions Zone was raised, with several people heckling Mr Khan, calling him “a liar”, saying he was “destroying businesses and lives” and demanding the data be published around his claim it was cleaning up the air.  Ulez was expanded London-wide in August 2023, charging people with older, more polluting vehicles £12.50 a day, or the option to scrap them for a less polluting model.  One man was ordered to leave the venue as he continued to challenge Sadiq Khan on the scheme, giving two fingers as he walked out.  He complained that he kept getting “bombarded” with charges, every time he changed his number plates.  “I like to change them,” he said.

But the Mayor, who was re-elected for a third term at City Hall in May, stood defiant as he told the audience: “During the election, the Tories and even Reform, the number one issue for them was Ulez.  “They wanted it to be a referendum on Ulez and I’ll say this: Londoners gave me a record breaking, history-making victory.  “You either believe in democracy, or don’t. This great country believes in democracy. I’m not sure about you.”  He added: “95% of vehicles are now compliant, don’t pay a penny but see the benefits of cleaner air.” Sadiq Khan was also questioned on the scourge of machetes on London’s streets, by one man who told him “I don’t feel safe in the city I love” to which the mayor said: \"Home Secretaries have talked about banning them, I hope the next government will.\"  And on housing, he declared that “much more” affordable housing needed to be built, to avoid spiralling costs driving people out of the capital.  One police officer also took Mr Khan’s deputy mayor to task on accountability for officers, revealing he’d been sanctioned for asking a question at the same event two years ago, about the disproportionate way that Black officers are treated in the misconduct system.  He asked the same question again, admitting he “probably will” be served with another misconduct notice for doing so.  You can watch the full State of London debate back here.\n",

      "Transport Secretary Mark Harper has defended the Conservative pledge to reverse Labour's 'unfair' Ulez expansion, if they get re-elected. \n",
      "It is among a number of measures that they say make them \"the party on the side of drivers\". Speaking to LBC on Saturday morning, Mr Harper explained: \"We're not proposing to alter the Ulez zone that's in central London...what we're talking about is the expansion that took place.  \"The mayor's own impact assessment said that that expansion to outer London would have a minor to negligible effect on air quality ...it wasn't about air quality it was about taxing motorists and raising money.  \"It wasn't popular...people in outer London voted for Susan Hall, not Sadiq Khan.  \"The Ulez expansion to outer London affects a lot of people who live outside London, who have to come into London to work, potentially people in public services who drive in antisocial hours. They have no democratic control over the mayor of London.  \"We're going to reverse the expansion of Ulez to outer London, we're not altering the inner London piece, which I think did have a positive impact on air quality.  \"What we're doing doesn't affect the quality of air in London, it just stops punishing motorists, particularly the poorest ones.\" When questioned whether he was swimming against the tide of popular opinion, given Sadiq Khan's overwhelming majority, he reiterated that \"the expansion of Ulez had nothing to do with clean air\".  The Conservatives have said they would also end pay-per-mile road taxes and rule out blanket Low Traffic Neighbourhoods and 20mph zones. Money saved from cancelling HS2 will also be used to repair roads and fix potholes, they added. Susan Hall, the Conservatives' unsuccessful candidate for London mayor, also planned to end the Ulez expansion to the outer boroughs, which was brought in at the end of August last year. The £12.50 Ulez charge was originally introduced by Labour mayor Sadiq Khan in 2019 to improve air quality in London by disincentivising people with older, more polluting cars from driving in the capital. It has caused controversy, with some saying that they need their car to get around and cannot afford the charge. Others have backed the move for health and environmental reasons. The Ulez charge applies to all vehicles that have emissions standards older than Euro 4 for petrol engines, or Euro 6 for diesel engines. That means that petrol vehicles registered before 2005 and diesel vehicles registered before 2015 are likely to have pay the charge. Drivers of cars, smaller vans and motorbikes that don't meet Ulez standards have to pay £12.50 a day to drive within the zone. The Conservatives said in a statement that the ULEZ expansion had led to thousands of people living around London being charged to get to hospital appointments or where they work or study.  \"Pay-per-mile road taxes are one of the most worrying proposals currently being explored by local Labour politicians.  \"They could see drivers charged depending on how far they  drive, what time of day and what car they drive it in. Labour looked at a national scheme last time they were in Government. This Bill will make sure they can never be introduced.     \"While 20mph zones can help improve road safety in residential areas or outside schools, misuse undermines public trust and risks congestion and pollution, so we are clear  they must only be considered on a road-by-road basis, and with the support of people who live there.      \"So the Conservatives will rule out blanket Low Traffic Neighbourhoods and 20mph zones which have been so damaging to businesses.  \"Under these plans, local people will be newly  empowered with any new schemes subject to a local referendum and a right to challenge existing schemes. \"These measures will also apply in Wales where the Welsh Labour Government has ignored the views of the public and imposed blanket 20mph speed limits.      \"This builds on the Conservatives’ strong track record of backing drivers. Measures like freezing fuel duty for 14 years in a row, saving the average household £1,000, publishing  the milestone Plan for Drivers and putting hundreds of millions into the Safer Roads Fund.\"  They added they are building over 1,100 of new and upgraded major roads. They also said they will invest £8.3billion saved from cancelling HS2 to repair roads and fix potholes.

      "Highways bosses warned that anyone ignoring diversion signs in an attempt to find shorter alternative routes will be liable for the £12.50 Ulez fee if their vehicle does not meet minimum emissions standards. The motorway will be shut in both directions between Junctions 9 and 10 in Surrey from 9pm on Friday until 6am on Monday. Commuters have been urged not to drive this weekend.

Drivers who do not pay the charge could be fined up to £180. Jonathan Wade, project manager, said, “no enforcement action will be taken\" but insisted, “if you ignore the diversion signs and do your own thing, then if your vehicle's not compliant you do run the risk of getting caught”. He also added that work on Junction 10 may be stopped at different points across the weekend. “We wouldn’t jeopardise opening the M25 on Monday morning,\" Wade said.  Ulez was first introduced by Mayor of London Sadiq Khan in April 2019 but has since expanded to cover all of London boroughs.  This weekend will be the second of five planned closures of the M25, the major road which encircles London, undergoes a £317 million renovation project. RAC spokesperson Alice Simpson said drivers could face “up to six days of disrupted travel” as commuters also face upcoming national rail strikes. “Planning ahead is absolutely vital. Rather than relying on a sat nav, check the planned diversion routes ahead of time and be prepared for long delays,” said Simpson.  She also advised checking your vehicle before driving to reduce the chances of an \"unwelcome breakdown\".

The renovation project will increase the number of lanes, making it easier to enter and exit the M25 at Junction 10, one of the UK's busiest motorway junctions.

      "There are no legal barriers to sending non-Ulez compliant cars to Ukraine, Sadiq Khan has been told.\n",
      "The mayor of London previously said he believed he could not send cars to Kyiv to help their war effort. He was criticised for apparently getting too wrapped up in the red tape of his Ulez scrappage scheme, which allows drivers to hand in cars that don't meet emissions standards and claim up to £2,000 for a new vehicle. Vitali Klitschko, Kyiv's mayor, had asked him to send cars destined to be scrapped - many of which were expected to be 4x4s and pick-up trucks - to help save lives and provide transport. But Mr Khan late last year told him the idea had not met a \"legal threshold\" which requires the Ulez scheme to benefit Londoners from an \"economic, social and environmental perspective\". He then called on Mark Harper, the transport secretary, to give Londoners permission to donate their vehicles to Ukraine and still get paid to do so. Mr Harper has now responded to Mr Khan - telling him the Department for Transport does \"not consider there to be any legal barrier to allowing vehicles to be donated to Ukraine\". Read more: Sadiq Khan calls on government for help to send cars from Ulez scrappage scheme to ‘provide vital support to Ukraine’ In a letter published on Wednesday, he said: \"You have identified legal obstacles that relate to the processes and design of your scheme... You say you need robust assurance that cars donated to Ukraine will not find their way back to London's roads. \"The Ukrainian Embassy has helpfully confirmed to my officials that Ukrainian law prevents the sale of property of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and that, by decree, right-hand drive vehicles can only be driven in Ukraine by members of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.

He said DfT officials would help as soon as he confirms he will donate cars to Ukraine through the Ulez scrappage scheme. The Ukraine row was the latest in a series of arguments over Ulez, which now covers all of London. Mr Khan has maintained it is essential to cutting emissions and improving Londoners' health. But it was criticised for clamping down on the least wealthy by targeting older cars. Drivers whose vehicles don't meet the rules have to pay a daily charge of £12.50. Sir Keir Starmer has distanced himself from such schemes, while the Tories had looked into whether using a kind of pro-motorist stance would help boost their election prospects. \"Encouraging news from the transport secretary - let's keep working together to get this done,\" Mr Khan tweeted.\n",

      "Sadiq Khan has issued a warning to Ulez vandals after a six-year-old girl was injured due to a camera being torn down. \n",
      "The young girl was injured in a car crash after a Ulez camera in south east London, positioned on top of a set of traffic lights, was pulled to the ground by vandals.  The Metropolitan Police has warned those behind the attack to \"stop immediately\", which comes after a separate Ulez camera was blown up by an explosive device last year.  The Mayor of London issued his own warning to the vandals, warning them that the injury to the young girl could have been much worse. “The decision to expand the Ulez was a difficult decision for me to take but it was the right one for me to make,” he told LBC's James O'Brien. “I understand there are people, though, there are people who oppose my policy of expanding the Ulez “I think it’s legitimate to protest but the way to protest should be lawful, peaceful and safe.  “This is just one example of the consequences of those who are against the Ulez breaking the law because we’ve got a situation where a child has been injured as a consequence of action from those who are anti-Ulez. “I’d encourage them to protest in a way that’s lawful, peaceful and safe because what we don’t want, God forbid, is an injury that’s even more serious.” The Ulez camera was pulled down at the junction of Old Priory Avenue and Court Road in Orpington, at around 6.30am on Thursday.  It came just hours after five different sets of traffic lights were cut down near a similar location.  Chief Inspector Prita Shoma said: “Two police units, who should have been available to answer 999 calls, were instead required to spend the morning managing traffic. “The people who are carrying out this criminal damage are putting the public at risk. This morning, there has been a collision between two cars on Court Road, at the location of one of the damaged traffic lights, in which a child was injured. “I would urge the people carrying out these crimes to stop immediately.” Read More: Millions of pounds in Ulez fines challenged by European drivers who say rules weren't made clear Read More: Sadiq Khan calls on government for help to send cars from Ulez scrappage scheme to ‘provide vital support to Ukraine’ “Police were called shortly before 8.30am on Thursday, Jan 18.

      "A mother has accused the London Mayor of leaving her in ‘perpetual debt’ because of the Ulez charge, saying it takes up all of her disposable income.\n",
      "Sarah, from Croydon, spoke to Sadiq Khan on LBC this morning where she said all of her extra money is being swallowed up by the £12.50 daily fee for driving an older car in the capital. She told Mr Khan that she was evicted from her home under a no fault eviction which had left her in “perpetual debt.” She said she had been moved to temporary accommodation and where previously at the end of the month after bills, she had £300-£400 to spend, now every single month her finances are “wiped out before I even start my month?” because of Ulez fees. “I’m waiting for pay day just to buy milk,” she said. “People like me are left out of the equation because the council says I earn too much.” Mr Khan said: “We have got a housing crisis across the country. We are spending more money on benefits than bricks and mortar. “The housing benefit has not increased with the rent for a number of years. He urged her to seek information about the scrappage scheme for her car to avoid Ulez fees. On her housing situation the Mayor said: “You should only be evicted if there’s a good reason for a landlord to evict you.\" Sarah came back: “You mention the scrappage scheme. For the scrappage scheme they only give you £2,000. £2,000 is not going to buy me a Ulez car. “With respect, it does,” said the Mayor. “I’m desperately sorry for the plight you are facing.” “I’ve still got £3,000 left on the car that I have. I don’t know what I’m supposed to do. I can’t get a new car because I can’t afford it,” Sarah said. Mr Khan urged her to speak to her finance company to discuss her options. Sarah was advised to speak to her council to discuss what options are available to her on whether she’s missing any benefits she may be entitled to. She was also encouraged by the Mayor to see what options were open to her on replacing her car with one that is Ulez compliant - perhaps by selling the vehicle in order to pay off the outstanding finance and then look at buying a new car. “Generally speaking, a petrol car that is newer than 2005 is Ulez compliant. People think they’ve got to buy an electric car or a hybrid car or a new car but that’s not the case,” Mr Khan said. Mr Khan announced today that TfL fares will be frozen until March next years to help Londoners with the cost of transport. Mr Khan said: \"While people across the country face another hike in their rail fares, I simply wasn't prepared to stand by and see TfL customers face a similar hike. \"This is the fifth fares freeze I've done since becoming mayor, making transport in our city 21% cheaper than it would have been had fares risen by inflation. \"This shows that whenever I can freeze fares, I do so. \"As we continue building a fairer, greener and more prosperous London for everyone, making public transport more affordable and appealing will continue to be a key part of my plan.\"\n",

      "The Metropolitan Police has warned those behind the attack to \"stop immediately\", which comes after a separate Ulez camera was blown up by an explosive device last year.  In this instance, the Ulez camera was pulled down at the junction of Old Priory Avenue and Court Road in Orpington, at around 6.30am on Thursday.  It came just hours after five different sets of traffic lights were cut down near a similar location.  Chief Inspector Prita Shoma said: “Two police units, who should have been available to answer 999 calls, were instead required to spend the morning managing traffic. “The people who are carrying out this criminal damage are putting the public at risk. This morning, there has been a collision between two cars on Court Road, at the location of one of the damaged traffic lights, in which a child was injured. “I would urge the people carrying out these crimes to stop immediately.” Read More: Millions of pounds in Ulez fines challenged by European drivers who say rules weren't made clear Read More: Sadiq Khan calls on government for help to send cars from Ulez scrappage scheme to ‘provide vital support to Ukraine’ “Police were called shortly before 8.30am on Thursday, Jan 18.

      "RMT boss Mick Lynch has announced his retirement after four years as the union's general secretary.\n",
      "The 63-year-old, who was elected general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) in 2021, has become somewhat of a tailismanic figure amongst the left in the UK, leading his union through a series of pay strikes over the past two years. Mr Lynch said he was “incredibly proud” to have served the union both as its chief and a rank-and-file member. \"It has been a privilege to serve this union for over 30 years in all capacities, but now it is time for change,” he told members. \"This union has been through a lot of struggles in recent years, and I believe that it has only made it stronger despite all the odds.

The union told members it will now begin the process to select a new secretary general, with a new official set to be in post by May. Outside of the RMT, Mr Lynch has become a central voice in pushing for more unionisation across the British workforce. Speaking in September last year, Mick Lynch called for a “return to the 1970s”. The fiery rail union leader called for “the complete organisation of the UK economy by trade unions” as he slammed Keir Starmer’s Labour Party. Mr Lynch said: “The problem at the moment is that the unions are not in every sector, effectively. “We’re not in every workplace. We’re not able to influence non-union recognised workplaces, whereas up to the 1970s and 80s, we were. “So if you went on a job as a construction worker that wasn’t organised, you tended to get the union agreement anyway, because it was enforceable by those workers.” He continued: “And that’s the prize we’ve got to keep our eyes on – that union influence is universal across the United Kingdom, completely universal. “The complete organisation of the UK economy by trade unions – that’s our aim.” Mr Lynch added: “We never step back from organising workers and we won’t do so under a Labour Government, no matter how diluted this Act may become.”\n",

      "The Rail, Maritime and Transport union said its members working as train managers will strike on New Year's Eve, January 2 and Sundays between January 12 and May 25. An RMT spokesperson said: \"Our members have resoundingly rejected Avanti's latest offers in two referendums and sustained strike action is now the only way to focus management's minds on reaching a negotiated settlement with the union.\" The RMT said up to 400 of its members are involved in the dispute.

      "RMT Transport Union members are set to walk out after train managers at the rail company voted to strike on December 22nd, 23rd and 29th. Following the strike announcement, Lord Hendy, the rail minister, said he was concerned about \"several train operators\" as Avanti's strike action could put increased pressure on other operators over the festive period. He said to the Commons Transport Committee: “Generally as a system, we’re over-reliant on overtime working for train crew. A revised timetable will be released on December 14.  Mick Lynch, the RMT’s general secretary, said to The Telegraph: “Avanti West Coast’s proposals have been decisively rejected by our train managers, sending a clear message to management that the current arrangements are unacceptable.“ Train managers are being treated unfairly compared to senior managers, who receive significant payments for covering these roles.

      "London Underground Tube drivers will deliberately reduce speeds to below 50mph to protest against 'extreme noise levels' of trains.\n",
      "The move comes as the RMT Union, which represents Tube drivers, voted to participate in industrial action against 'extreme' noise levels on the Victoria line. TfL said that it was working to remedy the problem but confirmed that the extreme noise levels are unlawful and have \"exceeded the legal limit\". In recent weeks, the noise levels have reportedly intensified, causing frustration among impacted Tube drivers. However, TfL has stated that the noise levels are not the same levels experienced by passengers. Tube drivers along the Victoria line have allegedly been asked to wear ear defenders until the problem is fixed. Read more: HS2 independent review launched in bid to get 'spiralling costs' back on track Read more: TikTok's 'Tube Girl' warned by TFL over sponsored videos The RMT Union described the \"noisy\" trains as \"extremely uncomfortable and distressing for drivers\". RMT general secretary Mick Lynch said: \"The fact that members have voted by a massive majority for action over this matter should alert London Underground to the strength of feeling and act upon in accordingly. \"If London Underground workers are impacted by these unacceptable noise levels the general public are also being affected by it.\" The complaints against Tube noise levels are not the first. TfL data shows that, between January 2020 and August 2022, there were more than 1,300 noise complaints made against Tube services. A TfL spokesperson said: \"We regularly measure noise levels across the Tube network, and recent results identified an increase in the level of noise exposure that Victoria line train operators are exposed to during the course of their shift. \"We have plans in place to address this through further improvements to the infrastructure along the Victoria line... \"We are encouraging our trade unions to work with us to fix this issue, so we can avoid unnecessary and disruptive industrial action that will impact Londoners.\" RMT union has not announced any dates for the 'go-slow' protests.  It comes after Aslef, another union representing Tube drivers, announced that 24-hour strikes will take place on November 7 and November 12.  RMT plans to strike on separate days between November 1 and November 8.  The strike action comes as RMT members rejected a pay offer that they \"deemed wholly inadequate\". But London Mayor Sadiq Khan is reportedly 'confident' that the Tube strikes won't happen. Aslef has supported RMT Union's complaints about the noise levels, stating that TfL has merely used a \"band-aid approach\" rather than thoroughly investigating the root cause of the noise, according to the BBC. The union says that the Central, Northern and Jubilee lines are also impacted by the noisy trains.  If the issues aren't resolved, the union added that it may ballot Aslef members for industrial action against TfL. According to City Hall data, TfL has spent nearly £30 million on 'rail grinding' in an attempt to decrease Tube noise levels.\n",

      "Members of the Public and Commercial Services union (PCS) will walk out for 14 days from October 28. The workers, employed by ISS and G4S, voted overwhelmingly for strike action. PCS general secretary Fran Heathcote said: \"This escalation reflects the anger of our G4S and ISS members. They are particularly incensed by the insulting pay offers and the unacceptable fact that many receive no company sick pay. \"Ministers must settle these disputes and work towards the insourcing of these contracts to end this perpetual race to the bottom on pay and conditions. \"Our members deliver vital services that keep the civil service functioning and deserve to be treated as civil servants, not second class citizens in their own workplaces.\" The action will affect the Department for Business and Trade, the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology, and the Cabinet Office, all based in London. This comes after cleaning staff at the Department of Education won a pay rise after a dispute over working conditions that rumbled on for over a year. Speaking earlier this month, Petros Elia, general secretary for UVW, said: “These brave workers have closed the gap between themselves and the civil servants they serve food to and clean up after by standing up for themselves. “The only way we will end the structural inequality created by outsourcing is through strike action. “Wealthy multinationals like ISS make billions off the backs of workers like our members and it takes strikes to get them to get them to cough up. “Every time DfE workers took strike action their numbers grew and we are organising outsourced workers across government offices now.”\n",

The ballot result ends what Aslef called the longest train drivers’ strike in recent history, during which drivers took 18 days of strike action. Aslef had accused the previous Conservative government of “sitting on its hands” and refusing to negotiate. Mick Whelan, Aslef’s general secretary, said: “It is with great pleasure that we can announce the end of the longest train drivers’ strike in history. “The strength and resilience and determination shown by train drivers to protect their hard-won and paid-for terms and conditions against the political piracy of an inept and destructive Tory government has prevailed. “It was not a fight we sought, or wanted. All we sought after five years without a pay rise, working for private companies who, throughout that period, declared millions of pounds in profits and dividends to shareholders, was a dent in the cost of living. “We are grateful that Louise Haigh, the Secretary of State for Transport, and the adults entered the room and sought an equitable way forward so that trains will perform and run in the interest of the passenger, of the taxpayer and of those who work in and are dedicated to this industry. “Those who have been lying about this pay offer, and conflating the deal offered to train drivers with decisions on the winter fuel allowance, should be ashamed. Transport Secretary Louise Haigh said: \"After two years of chaos on our railways under the Conservatives, this is an important step towards fixing our railways and getting the country moving again. “It will ensure a more reliable service by helping to protect passengers from national strikes, and crucially, it clears the way for vital reform – including modernising outdated working practices – to ensure a better performing railway for everyone. “We have inherited a £22billion blackhole in the nation’s finances. Every decision taken is to stabilise the economy and protect working people. The cost of not settling would significantly outstrip the cost of this below-inflation deal. “We won’t make the same mistake as the Conservatives, who deliberately prolonged disputes resulting in the longest strike in the history of the railways - costing our economy and the taxpayer more than £1bn. “This Labour Government will always put passengers and taxpayers first.” “Although it seems to be the work of those who would not accurately report anything about train drivers over the past two years. “Now we will get back to our day job of seeking a green, well-invested, vertically-integrated and safe public railway.”\n",

      "LNER train drivers have called off more than 20 days of planned strike action after successful union negotiations over work practice agreements.\n",
      "Members of Aslef were due to walk out on Saturday after the union claimed there had been a breakdown in industrial relations. The industrial action was set to take place over weekends for the next few months, heavily impacting people travelling between London and the northeast. Train drivers on LNER were due to be on strike on Saturdays from August 31 to November 9, and Sundays from September 2 to November 10, over a dispute about the breaking of agreements on work practices. The dispute is separate from the long-running pay row involving train drivers across the country. This specific issue looks set to be resolved after a new long-term pay offer was made.

The development follows meetings between the union and the company. Mick Whelan, general secretary of Aslef, said: “Once again we have demonstrated that by sitting round the table and negotiating, issues on the railway can be resolved in a way that means better workplace practices for rail workers and a better service for the travelling public. “Aslef will continue to campaign for a fully staffed railway that doesn’t rely on excessive use of driver overtime. “We continue to operate in good faith and we are pleased to have finally resolved this long-standing issue with LNER of abuse of our agreements. We look forward to normal working resuming.” Secretary of State for Transport Louise Haigh said: “For too long our railways have been brought to a standstill by industrial disputes with no end in sight. This is a constructive step forward to fixing our railways and getting the country moving. “Our priority is to deliver the vital reforms our broken railways need, but we cannot deliver reform if services aren’t running, and industrial disputes are left unresolved. “It’s very welcome that LNER and ASLEF have found a resolution to this dispute at no extra cost to the taxpayer and that will deliver an improved service for passengers.” An LNER spokesperson added: “After constructive talks with Aslef we are pleased that strikes planned to commence from this Saturday 31 August have been called off. “We will be looking to strengthen the timetable published for this weekend and advise customers to check for the latest information in advance of their journey.”\n",

      "Ministers have been accused of ‘favouring unions over pensioners’ as GPs are set to become the next to receive payouts after a deal was made with train drivers.\n",
      "The government has refused to say how much taxpayers will have to contribute towards the 15 per cent pay rise for rail workers. The deal, which was tabled on Wednesday, is expected to cost more than £100 million - but transport secretary Louise Haigh said it was better value for taxpayers than allowing industrial action to continue. GPs are now expected to be next in line to receive a pay rise. Health Secretary Wes Streeting has urged doctors not to “punish” patients by continuing with industrial action when the government wants to work with them to “rebuild the NHS”. He is said to have been seeking funding as part of the October Budget to help provide a solution to “general practice sustainability”, according to the Telegraph. Read more: Train drivers offered bumper pay deal to end strikes after two years of rail misery Read more: Junior doctors 'could strike again next year' despite 22% pay rise as union leader considers 'long sustained action' The paper said leaked letters revealed that the government had agreed to an above-inflation increase of 7.4 per cent - but the British Medical Association (BMA) wants more. It is pushing for a 10.7 per cent rise in one year, in a bid to bring real-terms income back to levels in 2018/19. It follows a \"major breakthrough\" in the long-running rail dispute, which saw train drivers offered a nearly 15 per cent pay rise over three years. The offer made to Aslef is a 5% pay rise for 2022/23, 4.75% for 23/24 and 4.5% for 24/25. Drivers are now set to vote on the multi-year pay offer, potentially putting an end to industrial action across the rail network. However, the RMT union - which represents workers such as guards, station staff and signallers - is now expecting the same offer as Aslef, according to the Times. A senior government source said they could not comment on “live talks” but insisted a negotiated settlement with the unions was in the best interests of taxpayers and passengers. “The cost of this deal is significantly less to the taxpayer than the cost of the ongoing strikes,” they said.  “It was spectacularly poor value to allow the strikes to drag on and on, causing huge disruption to the economy by provoking the unions again and again.” RMT's negotiations with the government are set to resume next week. The union previously accepted a four per cent pay deal from the previous government. “All things being equal, we are expecting a parallel, synchronised offer to that of Aslef,” RMT general secretary Mick Lynch said.  “We are meeting with the department on Tuesday on behalf of our members who work for train operating companies and there is another meeting on Thursday for staff who work for Network Rail.  \"All the indications are that we will be offered the same terms as Aslef. And we are expecting that it will be delivered.” Mr Lynch went on to warn that there could be “problems” if the same deal is not put on the table. But after Chancellor Rachel Reeves' decision to scrap the winter fuel allowance for most pensioners, Age UK's Caroline Abrahams told the Times: “We have been inundated with messages from pensioners who are angry and upset about the impact on them of losing their winter fuel payment this winter and, in the light of news stories about various industrial disputes being settled, some are also commenting that they feel they are being treated as a lower priority and that this is unfair.” Meanwhile, shadow transport secretary Helen Whately said: “The government has chosen to prioritise the unions over passengers and taxpayers — and pensioners, too.” She added that it was “deeply disappointing that this government has chosen not to include working practice reforms in their deal”. “Pensioners are being deprived of the winter fuel allowance, taxpayers are facing tax hikes and passengers are facing higher fares — all as a result of this government’s choice to put the unions first,\" Ms Whately went on to say. A government spokesman said: “We said we would be honest with the public and, with the dire state of the public finances that we have inherited, we must take difficult decisions to fix the foundations of the economy. “We are accepting the Review Body on Doctors’ and Dentists’ Remuneration pay recommendation of six per cent uplift to pay.  \"We are consulting on the implementation of the Review Body on Doctors’ and Dentists’ Remuneration for GPs and will announce further detail in due course.”\n",

      "The \"major breakthrough' in the long-running dispute follows a series of \"positive\" talks led by the government. Drivers are now set to vote on the multi-year pay offer, potentially putting an end to industrial action across the rail network. The offer made to Aslef is a 5% pay rise for 2022/23, 4.75% for 23/24 and 4.5% for 24/25. Union members have been advised to accept the offer, which is not conditional on changes to terms. Over the past two years, there have been several strikes and overtime bans due to the dispute.

This Labour Government is doing the right thing and putting passengers first.  “If accepted, this offer would finally bring an end to this long-running dispute, and allow us to move forward by driving up performance for passengers with the biggest overhaul to our railways in a generation.” Aslef's general secretary, Mick Whelan, said: \"We are pleased that after being treated with utter contempt for the last two years by the privatised train companies, and the previous government that was pulling their strings, we finally have a new government that listens and wants to make the railway work for staff, for passengers, and for the taxpayer. \"The offer is a good offer, a fair offer, and it is what we have always asked for - a clean offer, without a land grab for our terms and conditions that the companies, and previous government, tried to take in April last year. \"We will put it to members with a recommendation for them to accept.\"\n",

Mr Streeting added that the previous government failed to recruit enough doctors, leaving GPs \"overburdened\". There are fears any industrial action could bring the NHS to a 'standstill' as Brits are forced to turn to other services.  “If all GPs implemented the patient cap, that could have a catastrophic effect on the entire healthcare system”, Matthew Taylor, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, told The Guardian. “General practice is now supporting more patients than before the Covid pandemic, so any reduction in their activity will put more pressure on other services, including A&E.”\n",

      "Robert Laurenson, co-chairman of the junior doctors committee of the British Medical Association (BMA), said that the \"window of opportunity [for strikes] is about 12 months away\" because Labour is in a \"honeymoon period\". It comes after the BMA recommended that its members accept the government's offer, which includes a backdated pay rise of 4.05 per cent, in addition to an increase between 8.8 and 10.3 per cent. Junior doctors will then be given a further pay rise of six per cent for 2024-2025, in addition to an extra £1,000 cash boost (seven to nine per cent overall). Across the two years, junior doctors will see their wages rise by around 20 per cent - 15 per cent less than the 35 per cent they had asked for. Read More: Rachel Reeves 'to sell off Government buildings' - as she blames Tory cover-up for £20bn black hole Read More: Millions of Brits could be forced to turn to A&E as GPs threaten to ‘bring NHS to standstill’ with industrial action The government has said that the pay rise for junior doctors is meant to avert further strikes, which have caused over a million operations and appointments to be cancelled and delayed. But the BMA junior doctors' chief appeared to suggest that \"long sustained\" strikes could be ahead. Laurenson said in a WhatsApp message to colleagues: \"I would consider striking with a low threshold for 25/26 when Labour’s honeymoon period ends and they make some sort of mistake that leaves them politically vulnerable.\" He added in messages, seen by the Times, that \"the power dynamic has swung too far towards [the Labour government] for us to successfully achieve anything via strikes right now\". “Now the last two years the strategy was based on a general election and trying to extract a deal from a desperate chaotic government in decline.  \"I think the only way to extract a better deal would be to take long sustained action for probably the next 12 months.\" Laurenson said that for the past two years the BMA's strategy was \"based on a general election and trying to extract a deal from a desperate chaotic government in decline.\"  He added: \"I think the only way to extract a better deal would be to take long sustained action [strikes] for probably the next 12 months.\" A BMA spokesperson said in response: “The BMA’s junior doctor committee is recommending the pay deal to members in England and we believe the deal will bring an end to the strike action by junior doctors in England.  \"The offer is a start towards restoring the value of junior doctors and this government has shown it can learn from mistakes of the past.” Wes Streeting, the health secretary, has repeatedly said ending the strikes would be key to bringing down the waiting lists. There are currently 7.6 million people on the waiting list.  Meanwhile Chancellor Rachel Reeves told LBC's Nick Ferrari on Tuesday: \"We are in a situation where last year alone, the cost of industrial action in our national health service cost our economy £1.7 billion, and it cost 1.4 million cancelled operations and appointments. \"We couldn't continue to go on like this, so it was the right thing to do to accept those independent pay review bodies.\" Overall, some public sector workers will get a pay rise that will cost the taxpayer of over £9 billion, following a recommendation by an independent pay review body. At the same time, Ms Reeves has said this week that she was planning to raise taxes in October’s Budget to plug a £22 billion \"black hole\" in the country's finances. Ms Reeves says the previous Conservative government allocated money for programmes that it did not have. And she told the News Agents podcast that “I think that we will have to increase taxes in the Budget.”\n",

Teachers will also be given an above-inflation pay rise, it is understood. It comes as the Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, prepares to lay bare to Parliament and the nation the state of the public finances. The Government has insisted the state of the nation’s finances are worse than they anticipated, despite institutions such as the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) claiming the books were already open to analyse. But Ms Reeves will tell Parliament in a speech today that the previous Tory government had covered up the dire state of the UK economy. She will also announce the date of her first Budget, which is due later this year. Ministry of Defence sites and unused NHS site are set to be offered to try and fill what Ms Reeves has claimed is a £20bn funding hole that needs to be filled, according to the Telegraph. The newly-installed Labour Treasury chief will make the speech while confirming the findings of her departments' spending audit into previous administrations. But some fear that the speech will mark a departure from Labour promises not to raise taxes.  She is also expected to announce the formation of the Office of Value for Money to \"challenge government to deliver better value for money for taxpayers\".  Labour will also be worried by the prospect of facing fresh strikes in the coming days, this time by GPs who are protesting against their budget. Family doctors who run GP surgeries will vote today on whether they reduce the care they provide, including by limiting the number of patients they see every day. The British Medical Association (BMA) launched the vote in protest against the previous government increasing their budget by 1.9% for this year. Doctors are expected to vote in favour of taking industrial action, without partaking in full-scale strikes.\n",

      "A Treasury minister has hinted that public sector workers, including teachers and nurses, could receive a recommended 5.5% pay rise.\n",
      "Independent pay review bodies, representing 514,000 teachers and 1.36 million NHS workers, both recommended the above-inflation pay rise as it is in line with increases in private sector pay. It is a big jump from the three per cent the government has budgeted for, creating a further challenge for Rachel Reeves ahead of her first budget. But speaking to LBC, Treasury minister James Murray said there would be a cost even if the government does not strike a deal. \"The response to the recommendations involves a cost but as the Chancellor made very clear, there’s also a cost to not striking a deal,\" he said. \"There is a cost in terms of further industrial action, in terms of difficulties recruiting and retaining public sector workers and so there’s a cost to not getting a deal agreed as well. \"There is a process. By the end of July, [Ms Reeves] will come to Parliament and set out our response and that’s what she’s considering at the moment.\" Read more: Government to begin formal talks with junior doctors to end long-running pay row Read more: Average water bill to go up £94 over five years - see how much more you are set to pay Economists have warned £3.5 billion extra will be needed to fund teachers and nurses alone, potentially meaning more tax rise, spending cuts or increased borrowing. When asked how the government would fund the pay rise, Mr Murray said \"it is a difficult inheritance\" but Labour would stand by its commitments to not raise income tax and VAT. \"The Chancellor will set out all tax policy at the budget in the normal way but we're very clear that it’s a very difficult inheritance and it means some tough decisions,\" he said.  \"The position that we’re in is very constrained by the state of public finances.\" Keir Starmer previously said that he is ready to face down the demands of unions. Speaking during his first week as PM, he said: “The finances are in a very poor state. “I think that is obvious. And that’s why we’ve been careful in what we said going into the election and we’ll be careful what we say coming out of it.” But the ongoing pay dispute could result in more industrial action in coming months. Union leaders have warned of a \"big row\" if they are offered less, with it also likely to impact the government's attempt at resetting relations with them. Other public sector workers, including doctors, dentists, civil servants and police, are expected to see similar recommendations.  Certain frontline workers have been calling for an above-inflation rise after they were forced to settle for a 5 per cent pay rise last year - despite some senior doctors getting up to 19 per cent and junior doctors being in talks for 12 per cent. \"5.5 per cent is better than we thought and you’d struggle to argue against it,” one health union source told the Times. \"But if the government offered less than that we would get angry. They would really struggle to justify deviating from the independent process. \"It would get things off to a very bad start and the constructive spirit of working together that you could get with a new government would very quickly fall away. Ultimately, they need to find the money or have a big row with the unions.\" A government spokesman said: \"We value the vital contribution the almost 6 million public sector workers make to our country.  \"The pay review process is ongoing, and no final decisions have been made.  \"We will update in due course; however, we are under no illusions about the scale of the fiscal inheritance we face.'\n",

He delivered on his promise to call junior doctors in England on \"day one\" of a Labour Government.  \t It comes as health leaders have urged the government to resolve the long-running dispute over pay as a \"priority\" after it emerged that tens of thousands of appointments were postponed as a result of the latest strike. \"I have just spoken over the phone with the BMA (British Medical Association) junior doctors committee, and I can announce that talks to end their industrial action will begin next week,\" Mr Streeting said in a statement.  \t \"We promised during the campaign that we would begin negotiations as a matter of urgency, and that is what we are doing.\" Read more: Starmer unveils new cabinet as he appoints Angela Rayner deputy prime minister and Rachel Reeves as chancellor Read more: Joe Biden looks forward to strengthening 'special relationship' as he congratulates Keir Starmer on becoming PM Medics in training across the NHS went on strike for five days from June 27, with 61,989 appointments, procedures and operations postponed as a result of the industrial action.  \t It marked the 11th strike by junior doctors in 20 months.  \t Junior doctors in England have said their pay has been cut by more than a quarter over the last 15 years and have called for a 35% increase.  \t Mr Streeting previously said he would not meet the 35%, adding that if he gave in to the demand then \"any trade union worth their salt\" would come back the following year with the same request.  \t He said there is \"space for a discussion\" on pay, as well as negotiations on how to improve working conditions for medics in training.  \t BMA junior doctors committee co-chairs Dr Robert Laurenson and Dr Vivek Trivedi said in a statement: \"We were pleased to speak to the new Health Secretary Wes Streeting today, as he made good on his commitment made during the election campaign for JDC (the junior doctors' committee) to be his first call and get the ball rolling on negotiating a solution to the junior doctors' dispute.  \t \"We expect talks to begin properly next week.  \t \"As we have always been clear, only a credible offer, acceptable to our members, will end this dispute and we hope this will be made by the new government as soon as possible.\"\n",

      "Fears have been raised about the impact of the latest junior doctors strike, which comes amid a heatwave that has seen temperatures rise to over 30C in parts of the country.\n",
      "The latest five-day walkout that began on Thursday marks the 11th strike by junior doctors in England since their dispute began some 20 months ago. The junior doctors have said their pay has been cut by more than a quarter over the last 15 years and have called for a 35% salary increase. But NHS leaders have raised concerns about the \"major disruption\" the strike will cause in the aftermath of a heatwave which prompted a yellow \"heat-health alert\" across much of the country. Public health leaders warned earlier this week of an increased risk to life because of the heat. Meanwhile some doctors at hospitals in London that have recently been targeted by cyber attacks have agreed to stay on.  Read more: Brits bask in 30C scorcher as heatwave continues, but health alert issued amid fears of 'increase in mortality' Read more: 'Cut-price doctor' physician associates and anaesthesia associates acting illegally in one in eight NHS trusts Doctors have said that they don't want to be on strike, but feel they have no choice. Dr Kashif Cheema, of the doctors' union the British Medical Association, said: \"Patients are waiting ten hours in A&E corridors because there aren't enough of us to see them\". He added that \"the key reason for this is that people are going abroad where they can get paid better [and] have a better quality of life.\" And more strikes could take place in the summer if the next government does not progress negotiations with junior doctors in a \"timely manner\", the BMA has warned. The union said it had already begun talks with the Labour Party ahead of next week's General Election. Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting has promised talks on July 5 if his party wins, the BMA said. But Mr Streeting has said he will not meet the 35% ask, saying that if he gave in to the demand then \"any trade union worth their salt\" would come back the following year with the same request.  \t He has said there is \"space for a discussion\" on pay, as well as negotiations on how to improve working conditions for medics in training. Junior doctors said they would call off the strike if Prime Minister Rishi Sunak made a credible commitment to restore their pay. \"We were hoping that maybe this would allow him to see how this could be a mutual win for both,\" said Dr Vivek Trivedi, co-chair of the BMA's junior doctors' committee. He said the current strike mandate ends on September 19, adding: \"If talks do not move in a timely manner, then of course our members would expect us to call for strike action. \"We have had three 98% 'yes' votes to our ballots for industrial action to restore their pay because they know, unfortunately, words don't mean anything unless it's written down and action is taken to achieve something.\" Asked about talks with Mr Streeting, committee co-chair Dr Robert Laurenson said: \"He is talking about things like 'journey, not an event' - we're happy to have a multi-year pay deal. He has seemingly heard that and (his remark of) 'journey not an event' matches that.\" Dr Trivedi added: \"The main thing that I've taken away from discussions is that there does seem like there is a willingness to try and at least engage in constructive and meaningful (talks).\" The BMA's chairman of council Professor Philip Banfield said: \"It's got to a point where doctors felt completely disempowered and what has happened is the juniors have got together and power of social media and WhatsApp, they started talking to each other and saying: 'You know what, enough is enough'. \"The junior doctors are really good at communicating with each other via WhatsApp and that has been the key to the success of their strike action because the junior doctors committee can talk almost instantaneously with their membership - they can talk to 50,000 people really quickly and get instant reports back. I'd love to have an organisation that actually can do that. \"You've seen industrial action now go on for well over a year. It's incredibly disappointing that this has gone this far.\" He added: \"We have met with Labour several times over the last two years - we haven't always agreed, we've had disagreements. So, do I expect the conversation to take place? Yes. Do I expect that conversation to be one that is easy or tough? It'll be a tough conversation.\" Prof Banfield said Mr Sunak's government \"felt that although there was a probably a deal to be done with consultants and specialist doctors, that the junior doctors weren't interested in a deal at all\". \"It just has felt as if government has wanted to do a deal with consultants first, which has cost them a considerable amount of money. Then done the specialists and they've just procrastinated over the juniors.\" Siva Anandaciva, chief analyst at The King's Fund think tank, said: \"An immediate challenge facing the next government will be resolving industrial action in the NHS which has lasted for well over a year now.  \"It is difficult to comprehend how either the Conservative Party or the Labour Party can deliver on their manifesto commitment to recover NHS performance over the next parliament without first ending the dispute.\"\n",

They will also refuse to work overtime for three weeks from June 4. It comes after officers who work in terminals 2, 3, 4 and 5 took four days of action last month.

The union said it had written to the Home Office after previous industrial action to ‘highlight the many problems raised’ with the new system. PCS general secretary Fran Heathcote said: \"We are keen to resolve this dispute but the Home Office must first put something on the table for our members to consider. \"The Home Office has said it is 'open to discuss' a resolution but it only responded to our request for a meeting after we threatened further action. \"Until it comes back with changes to the roster that will benefit our members then the dispute will continue.\" Read more: World No1 golfer Scottie Scheffler charged with assaulting police officer outside US PGA Championship Read more: Who is Scottie Scheffler and why has he been arrested?

That means their union BALPA will go back to negotiating with Easyjet, with the threat of industrial action a possibility. Pilots who have ten years' experience earn around £164,000 currently, and the new deal would have raised that to £190,000 in October and close to £200,000 next April.

Some 96% of pilots at the airline voted for strike action.

      "Train strikes on Monday morning brought much of the railway network to a standstill, causing chaos for commuters.\n",
      "The strike by train drivers' union Aslef is the latest walkout in their long-running dispute with train operators over salaries. Monday's action was the third strike in four days, with services into London from the south-east of England and East Anglia particularly hard hit. The strike hit c2c, Gatwick Express, Greater Anglia, Southeastern, Southern, South Western Railway, Great Northern and Thameslink. Read more: Tube strikes called off after talks between union and TfL Read more: Border Force strike at Heathrow Airport suspended South Western Railway said reduced services would run on a small number of lines between 7am and 7pm, with much of the network closed. Southern said a shuttle service would be running between London Victoria and Gatwick Airport, but the vast majority of its trains would not run No Thameslink services will operate, apart from a limited shuttle between Luton, Luton Airport Parkway and London St Pancras, and a limited non-stop train between London Kings Cross and Cambridge.  Great Northern and Gatwick Express will not run any services at all, but Gatwick Airport will continue to be served by the limited non-stop Southern shuttle.  \t Southeastern advised people not to travel, and said most of its routes and stations would be closed, with an extremely limited service where trains are running. A statement said: \"If you do travel, expect severe disruption, plan ahead and allow much more time for your journey.  \t \"Trains that are running will be extremely busy, they start later and finish early. You may be unable to board trains at some stations, and we estimate that there could be queues for up to two hours due to the very limited service. Only 29 out of 165 Southeastern stations will be open. No rail replacement buses will serve stations that are closed.\"  \t No c2c trains will run. Rob Mullen, c2c managing director, said: \"I'm really disappointed that an agreement with Aslef hasn't been reached. The impact of this ongoing action is significant for our customers and colleagues. \"I'm hopeful that further meetings with the unions are productive and see progress made toward concluding this challenging time for the railway.\" Greater Anglia said its first trains would start later and last trains finish earlier than usual, apart from the Stansted Express. An hourly train service will operate on routes between Norwich/Colchester and London Liverpool Street; Southend Victoria and London Liverpool Street; Stansted Airport and London Liverpool Street. A bi-hourly train service will run between Cambridge and London. A Rail Delivery Group spokesperson said: \"Train companies are working through plans to manage the unnecessary disruption to our passengers caused by this damaging industrial action. \"Minimum service levels are one potential tool for that but they are not a silver bullet. In the meantime we remain committed to resolving this dispute and our offer, which would take average driver salaries to £65,000 for a four-day week without overtime, remains on the table.\" A Department for Transport spokesperson said: \"Aslef is the only rail union continuing to strike, targeting passengers and preventing their own members from voting on the pay offer that remains on the table. \"Having resolved disputes with all other rail unions, the Transport Secretary and rail minister have ensured that a pay offer is on the table - taking train drivers' average salaries from £60,000 up to £65,000.\" National Express was adding thousands of extra seats across its UK-wide coach network. It comes after an Aslef Tube strike for Monday and May 4 was called off last week when the union and Transport for London reached an agreement over working conditions.\n",

      "Consultants in England have voted to accept a government pay deal - bringing to an end the dispute which had led to strike action.\n",
      "The British Medical Association (BMA), a trade union which has been representing senior doctors during the year-long pay dispute - put the offer to its members, with 83 per cent voting in favour. Consultants who are members of the British Medical Association (BMA) and the Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association (HCSA) have backed a fresh pay deal.  The offer will mean some consultants will receive a pay increase of nearly 20% for the financial year 2023-24.  Junior doctors in England remain in dispute with ministers over pay, and have a fresh mandate to strike.  Read More: Tube strikes called off after talks between union and TfL Read More: Schools could face teacher strikes in autumn term over pay, union leader warns The BMA said the offer includes important changes which represents \"significant progress\" in returning the pay review body to its \"original purpose and independence\".  It said that from next year, there will be changes to the way the review body will appoint members, and the Government will no longer be able to constrain its remit with reference to inflation targets and economic evidence.  The BMA added that the changes mean the doctors' pay review body can \"no longer ignore the historical losses that doctors have suffered or the fact that countries abroad are competing for UK doctors with the offer of significantly higher salaries.  \"The offer also improves on the previous proposal to reform the consultant pay scale.\"  The deal includes a 2.85 per cent (£3,000) uplift for those who have been consultants between four and seven years, who under the original offer received no additional uplift, said the BMA.  The offer is in addition to the six per cent awarded last summer.  Dr Vishal Sharma, chairman of the BMA consultants committee, said: \"The last year has seen consultants take unprecedented strike action in our fight to address our concerns about pay and how the supposedly independent pay review process was operating.  \"After years of repeated real-terms pay cuts, caused by Government interference and a failure of the pay review process, consultants have spoken and now clearly feel that this offer is enough of a first step to address our concerns to end the current dispute.  \"However, it's now imperative that the DDRB (pay review body) utilises its independence to restore doctors' pay and prevent any further disputes from arising.  \"We've reached this point not just through our tough negotiations with the Government, but thanks to the resolve of consultants, who took the difficult decision to strike, and did so safely and effectively, on multiple occasions, sending a clear message that they would not back down.  \"At the heart of this dispute was our concern for patients and the future sustainability of the NHS. Without valuing doctors, we lose them. Without doctors, we have no NHS and patients suffer. \"But the fight is not yet over. This is only the end of the beginning, and we have some way to go before the pay consultants have lost over the last 15 years has been restored. Therefore, all eyes will be on this year's pay review round, recommendations from the DDRB and response from the Government.\"  Members of the Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association (HCSA) also voted - by 83% - to accept the offer. President Dr Naru Narayanan said: \"Our members' resilience and courage has seen them secure long overdue improvements to pay. \"This is the best deal available right now and a step firmly in the right direction. \"We will continue to ensure that consultants' enormous contribution to the NHS is properly recognised. This will include holding the Government to account on the implementation of reforms to the pay review body.  \"It is now time for the Government to step up and make our junior and SAS doctor colleagues fair pay offers.

The BMA has a fresh six-month strike mandate after talks collapsed late last year. However, no new strike dates have been announced yet.

      "Rail passengers across the country were hit by fresh strikes this morning as another walkout by train drivers got under way.\n",
      "Aslef members, who are paid an average of around £60,000 a year, will also strike tomorrow, affecting several rail operators.  This includes Avanti West Coast, CrossCountry, East Midlands Railway, West Midlands Railway and London Northwestern Railway, all of which ran no services this morning.  Commuters were told not to bother trying to travel as a ban on overtime also took effect at 16 companies until tomorrow. It comes as part of a long-running dispute over pay and working conditions.   The latest round of industrial action by train drivers is expected to cause economic damage to the hospitality industry, too.  UKHospitality has estimated that the latest action will cost the sector £387million, adding that strikes this year have lost the sector around £750million.  The dispute dates back to 2022 and there is currently no end in site after Aslef rejected an eight per cent pay rise spread across two years. This would have taken the average salary of members up to around £65,000. Read More: Tube strikes called off after talks between union and TfL Read More: Schools could face teacher strikes in autumn term over pay, union leader warns The strike will continue into tomorrow, with more operators to be affected, before pausing on Sunday.  There will be no services from Chiltern Railways, Great Western Railway, Northern, London North Eastern Railway (LNER), Heathrow Express and TransPennine Express on Saturday.  Meanwhile, on Monday, a strike will hit c2c, Gatwick Express, Greater Anglia, Southeastern, Great Northern, Southern, Stansted Express, South Western Railway and Thameslink Another walkout will occur on April 20, when LNER drivers go on strike.  There has been relief for some commuters in London, however, with planned Tube strikes for April 8 and May 4 now not going ahead.  Aslef general secretary Mick Whelan said: \"Train drivers are fed up with the bad faith shown by this company, probably at the behest of the Transport Secretary, Mark Harper, and the rail minister, Huw Merriman, and we are not prepared to put up with being bullied and pushed about by a company that thinks it can break agreements whenever it feels like it. \"We honour the agreements we make, because we are honourable people. Train companies should do the same. \"It's two years since P&O sacked its workforce in a disgusting and disgraceful action that the Government allowed. But train companies in this country are not going to change our terms and conditions on a whim.\"\n",

      "Teachers represented by the National Education Union have overwhelmingly voted in favour of strike action in an indicative ballot over pay and funding. \n",
      "An overwhelming majority of National Education Union (NEU) teacher members in England and Wales who voted in the preliminary ballot were in favour of a strike to secure an above-inflation pay rise and additional funding for staffing.  Over 150,000 NEU teacher members in state schools and sixth forms took part in the electronic ballot.  The union consulted 300,000 of its teacher members working in maintained schools and sixth forms across England and Wales as part of the ballot. The ballot, which launched on March 2 and closed on Thursday March 28, asked members if they would vote yes to strike action for a fully funded, above-inflation pay rise and further funding to provide improved levels of staffing provision. The NEU, the largest education union in the UK, has said it will consider next steps at a special executive meeting on Tuesday. In England, which saw 50.3% of members turn out to vote, more than nine in 10 (90.3%) of participants said they would vote yes to strike action.  In Wales, where 54.1% of teacher members turned out to vote, 87.2% said they would vote yes to strike action over pay and funding. Nearly two-in-three (65.3%) members in Wales who took part in the indicative ballot also said they would support strike action if the Welsh Government reduced the summer break to four weeks.

The results of the consultative ballot are expected to be announced at their annual conference in Harrogate, Yorkshire over the Easter weekend. The ballot results come after the Department for Education (DfE) said in evidence to the School Teachers' Review Body (STRB) that teachers' pay awards should \"return to a more sustainable level\" after \"two unprecedented years\". Four education unions called off strike action last summer after the Government agreed to implement the STRB's recommendation of a 6.5% increase for teachers in England.  A DfE spokesperson said: \"The independent STRB is currently considering evidence for this year's pay award, unions should engage with this process instead of striking before they even know what the pay recommendations are. \"It is therefore extremely disappointing that the NEU has voted to proceed with a formal ballot for industrial action. \"Further strike action would cause more disruption to pupils who have already lost over 25 million school days due to last year's industrial action. \"Overall school funding is rising to over £60 billion in 2024/25, its highest ever level in real terms per pupil - and teachers have already benefited from two historic pay awards totalling over 12% in just two years.\"\n",

Members of Aslef - one of the largest rail workers unions - will hold a rolling programme of one-day walkouts between April 5 and 8, coupled with a six-day ban on overtime. The union said it wanted to increase the pressure on the \"intransigent\" train companies and the \"tone-deaf\" government following a series of strikes stretching back 20 months. Train drivers have now not had a pay rise for five years, since April 2019, said Aslef.

Those votes show a clear rejection by train drivers of the ridiculous offer put to us in April last year by the Rail Delivery Group (RDG) which knew that offer would be rejected because a land grab for all the terms and conditions we have negotiated over the years would never be accepted by our members. \"Since then train drivers have voted, time and again, to take action in pursuit of a pay rise. That's why Mark Harper, the Transport Secretary, is being disingenuous when he says that offer should have been put to members. \"Drivers wouldn't vote for industrial action, again and again and again, if they thought that was a good offer. That offer was dead in the water in April last year and Mr Harper knows that. \"We asked Mr Harper, or his deputy, the rail minister Huw Merriman, to come and meet us. We asked the Rail Delivery Group and the Train Operating Companies (TOCs) to come and talk to us. \"We haven't heard from Mr Harper, Mr Merriman, the RDG, or the TOCs since those new mandates were announced four weeks ago. \"In fact, Mr Harper hasn't deigned to talk to us since December 2022. Mr Merriman hasn't talked to us since January 2023 and the RDG has not seen fit to join us in the room since April last year. \"We have given the government every opportunity to come to the table but it is now clear they do not want to resolve this dispute. They are happy for it go on and on.\" The April 8 strike coincides with a strike by train drivers on London Underground in a separate dispute over terms and conditions. A Rail Delivery Group spokesperson said: \"Nobody wins when industrial action impacts people's lives and livelihoods, and we will work hard to minimise any disruption to our passengers. \"We want to resolve this dispute, but the Aslef leadership need to recognise that hard-pressed taxpayers are continuing to contribute an extra £54 million a week just to keep services running post-Covid. \"We continue to seek an agreement with the Aslef leadership and remain open to talks to find a solution to this dispute.\"\n",

Since March last year there have been a total of 10 junior doctor walkouts, with more set to come following the announcement of today's vote. Junior doctors part of the BMA are asking for a 35 per cent pay rise - which they have called \"perfectly reasonable\". The government believes the BMA's demands are unreasonable, however, with the health secretary calling for a \"reasonable solution” to end the action.

Announcing the result of the re-ballot junior doctors committee co-chairs Dr Robert Laurenson and Dr Vivek Trivedi thanked their colleagues for voting for the new mandate. They called on the health secretary to come forward and make a new offer \"as soon as possible\". Junior doctors are asking the government to increase their pay so it reflects what they were paid in 2008 in line with real-term inflation - calling their demands \"perfectly reasonable\". “It has now been a year since we began strike action”, they said in a statement. “That is a year of too many strikes. The government believed it could ignore, delay, and offer excuses long enough that we would simply give up. “We ask the health secretary to come forward as soon as possible with a new offer - and make sure not a single further strike day need be called.” Junior doctors have had a nine per cent pay rise this financial year. Addressing the demands after junior doctors rejected a pay offer in February, Victoria Atkins, the health secretary, said: “We already provided them with a pay increase of up to 10.3 per cent and were prepared to go further. “We urged them to put an offer to their members, but they refused. We are also open to further discussions on improving doctors’ and the wider workforce’s working lives.”\n",

A grassroots group of couriers, who have organised the action, say they want to draw attention to poor pay and working conditions. \"They think we are nothing. They don't respect us,\" Delivery Job UK wrote in a post on Instagram announcing the strike. \"Sacrificing a few hours for our rights is essential, instead of continuing to work incessantly for insufficient wages.\" \"Our request is simple: we want fair compensation for the work we do.

It's time for our voices to be heard.\" Read More: BMA offers to call off action in return for increased strike mandate Read More: Pensions Regulator staff to stage fresh strikes in dispute over pay The group posted the call for industrial action in Portuguese and is orgnaised by predominantly Brazilian couriers.  Deliveroo however said: \"Deliveroo aims to provide riders with the flexible work riders tell us they value, attractive earning opportunities and protections. Rider retention rates are high and the overwhelming majority of riders tell us that they are satisfied working with us. We value dialogue with riders, which is why we have a voluntary partnership agreement with a trade union, which includes annual discussions on pay. We are pleased to also be able to offer riders free insurance, sickness cover, financial support when riders become new parents and a range of training opportunities.” Riders who deliver takeaway food and groceries across the country for Deliveroo, Uber Eats, Just Eat and Stuart.com are all expected to take part in the strike. Delivery Job UK said its drivers are paid between £2.80 to £3.15 for each delivery. A spokesperson for the group told the BBC that Deliveroo riders wanted this payment to rise to at least £5. This would vary for other apps that use different payment structures. Delivery app riders and drivers are not officially unionised. GMB, the general trade union in the UK which has over 560,000 members, has an agreement with Deliveroo, however,  The industrial action is expected to go beyond the UK, with Uber and Lyft drivers set to strike in the US for two hours. Some 130,000 drivers could take part in the US, Justice for App Workers said. Deliveroo, in a statement, told the BBC: \"Riders always earn at least the national living wage, plus vehicle costs, for the time they are working with us, though the vast majority earn far more than this. \"Riders are also automatically insured for free, covering them if they are in an accident or injured while working and receive income protection if they are unwell and cannot work.\" Uber Eats told the corporation: \"We know that the vast majority of couriers are satisfied with their experience on the app, and we regularly engage with couriers to look at how we can improve their experience.\" Just Eat added that it had provided workers \"a highly competitive base rate to self-employed couriers and also offer regular incentives to help them maximise their earnings\". \"We continue to review our pay structure regularly and welcome any feedback from couriers.\" Stuart.com said it is \"committed to providing competitive earnings opportunities for courier partners\".\n",

      "Rishi Sunak has claimed the ‘impact of Covid’ is still affecting the quality of NHS services.\n",
      "Speaking to LBC News, the Prime Minister said: \"We are still dealing with the impact of Covid on the NHS and the backlogs that has created - but we are making progress. “The performance of ambulances and A&E this winter is better than it was last winter. “On waiting lists, we are not making as much progress as we’d like, but waits for the longest waiters have been virtually eliminated. “We saw in November the waiting list declined by around 100,000 because there were no strikes at all.” “There’s more work to do but the plan we’ve put in place is working,” the PM said.

The British Medical Association (BMA) said the Government had \"failed to meet the deadline to put an improved pay offer on the table\". Thousands of medics will now go on strike in England from 7am on February 24 until 11.59pm on February 28. The BMA has also not ruled out further strike action. Junior doctors in England staged the longest strike in NHS history in January, for six full days from January 3 to January 9. BMA junior doctors committee co-chairs Dr Robert Laurenson and Dr Vivek Trivedi said in a statement: \"We have made every effort to work with the Government in finding a fair solution to this dispute whilst trying to avoid strike action. \"Even yesterday, we were willing to delay further strike action in exchange for a short extension of our current strike mandate. \"Had the Health Secretary agreed to this, an act of good faith on both sides, talks could have gone ahead without more strikes. \"Sadly, the Government declined.\" Health and Social Care Secretary Victoria Atkins said planned strike action by junior doctors from February 24 to February 28 showed that they are not \"ready to be reasonable\". In a statement, she said: \"I want to find a reasonable solution that ends strike action. This action called by the BMA Junior Doctor Committee does not signal that they are ready to be reasonable. \"We already provided them with a pay increase of up to 10.3% and were prepared to go further. We urged them to put an offer to their members, but they refused. We are also open to further discussions on improving doctors' and the wider workforce's working lives. \"I want to focus on cutting waiting times for patients rather than industrial action. We have been making progress with waiting lists falling for three months in a row. \"Five days of action will put enormous pressure on the NHS and is not in the spirit of constructive dialogue. To make progress I ask the Junior Doctors Committee to cancel their action and come back to the table to find a way forward for patients and our NHS.\" LBC also learned the devastating story of a mother, 39, who collapsed under her coat after a seven-hour wait at A&E after she went there complaining of a severe headache. The 39-year-old had been waiting for at least seven hours at Queen’s Medical Centre in Nottingham before she was discovered unconscious under a coat. 'Shocked' staff at A&E have said they believe the long waiting times at the department may have contributed to her death. The woman first attended A&E in the late hours of January 19 complaining of a severe headache. She was triaged and observed three times by nurses and while her case was escalated, she was not seen by a doctor before being discovered. When the mother was eventually called to see a doctor, she failed to respond multiple times, so it was assumed that she had left due to the duration of her wait. She died on January 22, a few days after she had been transferred to intensive care. Former NHS trust chairman Roy Lilley told LBC that the case is likely to be “escalated”. “What will happen now is that the medical director will start an internal inquiry. My guess is they will also bring in an independent doctor from another hospital or maybe one of the royal colleges to look at the processes and protocols to see what happened. “It will be escalated. It is a reportable event. It will go forward to NHS England and they may well want a further independent inquiry. On top of that, the woman will be subject to a coroner’s inquiry.” Dr Keith Girling, Medical Director at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust said: “I offer my sincere condolences to the family at this difficult time. “An investigation, which will involve the family, will now take place and until this has been concluded, we are unable to comment further.” The Department of Health and Social Care has been approached for comment.\n",

      "'I don’t believe they want to resolve this,' union boss tells government as strike cripples trains and sparks travel chaos\n",

      "A fresh strike has been announced by rail workers as train services were crippled on Tuesday because of a walkout by drivers.\n",
      "Aslef staged another strike in their long-running dispute over pay and conditions, bringing misery for commuters making their way to work today. But General Secretary of Aslef Mick Whelan told LBC this morning: \"They [the government] created a problem on the railways they didn’t need to create. \"I'm at a stage now where I don’t believe they want to resolve this. “We’ve been dealing with these companies for 23 years and it’s our members’ policy that we don’t put deals out that we don’t recommend or that have been rejected.” Read more: Ministers warned new minimum service levels was doomed to fail as rail networks grind to a halt Read more: Teenage boys stabbed to death in Bristol were 'innocent victims' who were 'in the wrong place at the wrong time' Services across southern England were cancelled or reduced as members of Aslef staged another strike in their long-running dispute over pay and conditions. The strike forced people to drive to work, which led to huge traffic jams on roads including the M25. The Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) announced a strike by London Overground workers in a separate dispute over pay. More than 300 union members will walk out for 48 hours on February 19 and again on March 4. Security, station, revenue and control staff are among those taking industrial action. The RMT said that Arriva Rail London (ARL), which has the contract on London Overground, has offered a below inflation pay offer. Union members overwhelmingly voted for action in response. RMT general secretary Mick Lynch said: \"London Overground workers do an important job delivering services for Transport for London and supporting passengers on journeys throughout London. \"Our members are furious that they have been given a below inflation pay offer and want to see an improvement that represents the value they bring to the company. \"If this dispute cannot be resolved then RMT is more than prepared for a sustained period of industrial action to get London Overground workers the pay rise they deserve.\" Rail services are already being affected by a nine-day ban on overtime by Aslef members which started on Monday. On Tuesday, drivers went on strike at Southeastern, Southern/Gatwick Express, Great Northern, Thameslink and South Western Railway followed by walkouts at Northern Trains and TPE on Wednesday, at LNER, Greater Anglia and C2C on Friday, at West Midlands Trains, Avanti West Coast and East Midlands Railway on Saturday February 3 and at Great Western, CrossCountry and Chiltern on Monday February 5. South Western Railway urged passengers to only travel if \"absolutely necessary\" on Tuesday, warning that a significantly reduced service will operate on a limited number of lines. A statement said: \"Large parts of our network will be closed and trains will only run between 0700 and 1900. There will be no services outside of these times.\" There will be similar levels of disruption at other train operators embroiled in the dispute. Where services do run they will start later and finish earlier than usual. Picket lines were mounted outside railway stations. Aslef's general secretary Mick Whelan says some drivers have not had a pay rise for almost five years. He has accused the Government of \"giving up\" trying to resolve the row. The strikes were expected to be the first test of the minimum service levels legislation, aimed at ensuring train operators could run 40% of services. However, none of the train companies are using the new law, which the Government is also planning to extend to other sectors. Labour has said it will repeal the law if it wins the next general election. Downing Street expressed disappointment at rail operators who are not using the legislation. The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: \"It's something the rail operators called for many months ago and the public would rightly expect them to be used if strike action is taking place.\" Asked if No 10 is disappointed with the operators, he said: \"Yes, it's something that we and the public expect them to use. \"It's ultimately up to train operators to effectively manage their services, we have been as clear as possible that they should be as ready to use all powers available to them to reduce the impact of rail strikes on passengers.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "Police said they were called to 32 Portland Place, known for notorious sex parties, at 7am on Sunday morning following reports of an assault. A group of men used knives to stab party-goers during the fight, according to The Sun. The mansion is where OnlyFans star Bonnie Blue recently slept with more than 1,000 men in 12 hours. A source told The Sun: “There was blood everywhere with people lying injured all over the place. “It looked like a battle scene rather than a sex club.” Met officers attended along with the London Ambulance service and four people were taken to hospital. Three of the victims had been stabbed, police said. Their injuries are not believed to be life threatening. Three men were arrested, one on suspicion of GBH and possession with intent to supply, one man on suspicion of GBH and another man on suspicion of possession with intent to supply.  Police said they had imposed a Section 76 Closure Notice “to prevent further disruption to the local area,” which allows them to shutter the property for up to 48 hours.

Magistrates were told last year that police had been dispatched to the address 63 times over the last few years. Neighbours have said they have suffered years of extremely loud music, revellers taking drugs and vomiting in the street. Last December, Davenport flew back from Thailand to successfully challenge the closure order at City of London Magistrates’ Court. He denies hosting all-night parties, saying he hosts art shows there every months with around 100 people, but that gatherings do not go on beyond midnight. He also denied any drug-taking at the mansion. “I am very anti-drugs, I don’t drink, I have had two kidney transplants,” he said. “Nobody would be smoking marijuana in my house. “I am absolutely certain there is no illegal activity (at the parties).” Magistrate Mr Gowlett said at the time: “We do not find the case for closure has been proved on balance of probability, and therefore refuse the order that is sought.”\n",

Speaking to LBC's Nick Ferrari at Breakfast, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said: \"There's been a huge increase in street theft, a 50% increase in two years, a lot of that driven by mobile phones, the huge frustration people have when they can say, 'I can track my phone, I can see where it is'. \"Yet there's huge delays in police having powers to step in, so this will give the police powers for warrantless entry where there is electronic evidence so they can move much faster\".

Deliveroo, Pizza Express, Dishoom, Morrisons and Pho are among the businesses to have told her to send a “clear message\" that abuse against delivery riders \"will not be tolerated\". Their letter reads: \"There are real people behind these numbers - people who face physical and verbal assault, racism, sexism and theft. \"The Government has rightly committed to creating a standalone offence of assaulting or threatening our retail workers when they're at their place of work, but this stops short of protecting delivery riders when they are on a delivery.\" Measures to close a loophole around the online sale of knives to under 18s, which would see tech executives being held personally responsible, are set to be introduced to the Crime and Policing Bill at a later date. The proposed law also seeks to improve accountability processes for serving police officers and promises to reform the way the IOPC watchdog investigates serving officers. A presumption of anonymity for armed officers accused of shooting a person dead on the job is also due to be added to the Bill.\n",

      "The fully functional 18-carat solid gold toilet worth £2.8 million was stolen in less than five minutes in an 'audacious raid' in Blenheim Palace, a court heard.\n",
      "The toilet, which was created by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan, was a star attraction in an exhibition when it was stolen by sledgehammer-wielding thieves who smashed their way into the palace. The men had apparently planned the raid in detail, and stole the fully functioning toilet weighing 98kg in less than five minutes. Within days of the raid, two men were using \"car\" as a codeword for the stolen gold via WhatsApp messages, and contact was made with a Hatton Garden jeweller, the prosecution said. It is believed that the distinctive toilet, entitled America, which had been installed as an artwork at the Oxfordshire country house where Sir Winston Churchill was born, has now been split up and disposed of, Oxford Crown Court was told. Prosecutor Julian Christopher KC said the raid took just five minutes, adding: \"This case concerns the theft of a work of art from Blenheim Palace in September 2019. Read more: Teenager who admitted killing his mother and siblings in Luton flat was planning a school shooting, police reveal \"It was an unusual work of art, being a fully functioning toilet made of 18 carat gold, entitled America. \"It weighed approximately 98kg and was insured for the sum of six million dollars (£4.75 million) \"The gold it was made from was itself worth in the region of £2.8 million at the time.\" Michael Jones, 39, from Oxford, pleaded not guilty in January to stealing artwork in an overnight raid in the early hours of September 14 2019. Frederick Sines, 36, also known as Frederick Doe, of Winkfield, Windsor, Berkshire, and Bora Guccuk, 41, from west London, each deny one count of conspiracy to transfer criminal property. The court heard that the sledgehammers were left at the scene. Read more: Pope 'resumes some work' after 'slight improvement' in health as night-time prayers begin Mr Christopher said: \"The burglary was carefully planned and swiftly carried out. \"The men, five of them it appears, drove through locked wooden gates into the grounds of Blenheim Palace shortly before 5am in two stolen vehicles, an Isuzu truck and a VW Golf. \"They drove across a field, up to the front steps and smashed and broke in through a window. \"They knew precisely where to go, broke down the wooden door to the cubicle where the toilet was fully plumbed in, removed it, leaving water pouring out of the pipes, and drove away. \"All in all they spent just five minutes in the building. \"Clearly such an audacious raid would not have been possible without lots of preparation.\" A photograph was taken about 17 hours before the toilet was stolen and the prosecution allege that Jones had taken it while he was \"there as part of the reconnaissance for the burglary\". Mr Christopher added: \"The work of art was never recovered. It appears to have been split up into smaller amounts of gold and never recovered.\" It is alleged that Doe and Guccuk agreed to help one of the men who carried out the burglary - a defendant called James Sheen - to sell some of the gold in the following weeks.

In a WhatsApp voice message to Doe on September 16, Sheen said: \"I'll link up with ya, I got something right up your path.\" Doe replied: \"I do know just the man you need to see once you see me, the word on the street about the car, so I have the man there for you.\" The prosecution said the jewellers that Doe rang was Pacha of London in Hatton Garden, London, a business owned by Guccuk. They also exchanged messages about loose lips sinking ships, the court heard. There was no description of what sort of car was involved. Mr Christopher said: \"They both knew full well what was being talked about in this way because it was hot property. It is stolen property.\" The prosecution allege they spoke about the gold from the burglary and Sheen said that \"boys car is getting offered 26 and half\". Read more: MP Mike Amesbury jailed for 10 weeks for punching man in street in 'unprovoked drunken' assault It is alleged this is a reference to a price which others involved had been offered for their share of the gold, namely £26,500 per kilo. Official data suggests the normal price at the time for a kilogram of 18 carat gold was about £29,000, which would be the price for gold being sold legitimately on the open market. Sheen told Doe that he had \"20 cars\", which could been seen as reference to 20kg of the gold, according to the prosecution. It is alleged that Doe later told Sheen \"I'll find out now mate, I'll get some numbers now for you\". Mr Christopher said he \"then rang not a second-hand car dealership, but rather a jewellers\", in Hatton Garden. Jones was arrested on October 16 2019 and police analysed his phone. He had allegedly been searching for newspaper reports about the stolen toilet on September 20. It was also suggested that mobile telephone data allegedly appears to put Sheen, Doe and Guccuk in the vicinity of the Hatton Garden jeweller on September 23. The trial continues.\n",

      "The cause of death of two sisters whose bodies were found in a Scottish river have been revealed.\n",
      "Two bodies were recovered from the River Dee earlier in February, and were identified as sisters Eliza and Henrietta Huszti. The sisters, both aged 32, were last seen on CCTV on Market Street at Victoria Bridge over the River Dee in Aberdeen at about 2.12am on Tuesday January 7. The police have now confirmed that their cause of death was drowning. A woman's body was recovered from the river near Queen Elizabeth Bridge just before 8am on Friday January 31 before the body of a second woman was found in an area of the river near to the Victoria Bridge at around 9.05pm that day. The force said there do not appear to be any suspicious circumstances. The siblings' disappearance sparked a major Police Scotland operation, with the force's extensive searches of the River Dee coming to an end three weeks later. The sisters, part of a set of triplets, had made an earlier visit to the bridge where they were last seen hours before they disappeared, CCTV footage previously revealed. Police Scotland said a text message was also sent to the women's landlady on the morning they vanished, indicating they would not be returning to the flat.

      "A young man who murdered his mother and siblings in their flat in a shotgun triple killing was planning a school shooting, police have said.\n",
      "Nicholas Prosper, 19, pleaded guilty at Luton Crown Court to the murders of his mother, Juliana Falcon, 48, and his siblings, Giselle Prosper, 13, and Kyle Prosper, 16, in September last year in Luton. Prosper, of Leabank in Luton, pleaded guilty to three counts of murder at Luton Crown Court on Monday. Police later revealed he was planning a school shooting and had armed himself with a shotgun and at least 30 cartridges. After he killed his mother, brother and sister with shotgun blasts to the head, police said he planned to commit a shooting at a local school, but was arrested before he could carry it out. Officers found the shotgun hidden in bushes near to the crime scene. Detective Chief Inspector Sam Khanna, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit, said: \"This was a truly tragic and shocking case in which three innocent members of the same family have been brutally killed by their son and brother.  \"No words can fully describe the tragedy their loved ones have experienced, and our thoughts continue to be with them at this difficult time. We are pleased that Prosper has pleaded guilty and will not put his family through the pain of a trial, and that he will soon face a significant jail sentence.  \"What was subsequently uncovered during our investigation left no doubt as to his intentions to carry out an attack at a school, but fortunately Prosper was apprehended before he could cause any further harm.\" Assistant Chief Constable John Murphy said: \"We understand the deep shock this case will have on people within Luton and across the country. \"Juliana, Kyle and Giselle were brutally murdered in their home by someone intent on causing the maximum harm and distress on not only his family, but to the wider community. \"We are extremely grateful to our officers who stopped him and prevented him from going through with his plans to target a school. \"We are working closely alongside Luton Borough Council to engage with schools in Luton to provide support, assistance and guidance to both schools and parents.\" Read more: MP Mike Amesbury jailed for 10 weeks for punching man in street in 'unprovoked drunken' assault Prosper also pleaded guilty to purchasing or acquiring a shotgun without a certificate, possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life and possessing an article with a blade or point. Judge Michael Simon told the defendant his sentencing will take place on March 5 and remanded him into custody. Police rushed to the flat at around 5.30am.  All three victims died from gunshot wounds to the head, an inquest heard. After the shooting, police said they recovered a firearm during searches close to the scene.   Det Supt Rob Hall, from the region's major crime unit, previously described the scene officers faced in the flat as “awful circumstances”. After his guilty pleas, Councillor Hazel Simmons MBE, Leader of Luton Council, said: \"First and foremost, we must remember the three innocent victims of these senseless murders. Our thoughts and prayers are very much with them today, along with their family, friends and the wider community who are still deeply impacted by what happened last year. \"The revelation that the perpetrator had plans to cause further harm in one of our schools is extremely shocking, distressing and upsetting; and we don’t underestimate the emotional difficulty this news will have on children, staff, parents and carers across our school community. \"Our schools have robust systems in place to keep children safe and security is constantly reviewed and monitored. Just recently we asked our schools to further review security and for increased vigilance following the incident in a school in Sheffield. We will be asking schools to further review security measures in light of what came out in court today. \"On behalf of the town I would like to thank and praise the excellent work of Bedfordshire Police for apprehending the perpetrator before he attempted to cause more harm. However, we know this case will be unsettling for parents which is why the council is working with schools to put support in place in our schools to anyone who needs it.\"\n",

      "DC Gordon Irikefe has been dismissed after throwing a pyrotechnic into the crowd at a Bayern Munich v Arsenal match in Munich. A misconduct hearing last week heard that his behaviour was \"unacceptable\". “DC Irikefe has shown an unacceptable pattern of behaviour at football matches, for anyone, let alone a police officer who should uphold the highest of standards whether on or off duty,\" said Detective Superintendent Emma Bond, in charge of policing for the Central South area. The hearing found he had breached the standards of professional behaviour for discreditable conduct at the level of gross misconduct. Arsenal supporter DC Irikefe was also arrested by German police, at the Bayern Munich v Arsenal match, for wearing a full balaclava and sunglasses inside the stadium. The officer attended Westminster Magistrates’ Court today in relation to his disorderly and anti-social behaviour at Arsenal matches between October 2022 and April 2024. He has been heard 'tragedy' chanting at a Leicester City march, shouting 'helicopter', in reference to a helicopter crash that killed five people - including Leicester City club owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha. Other allegations included making lewd gestures, shouting abuse at players, and intimidating other fans. Reports claim that he wore a mask to conceal his identity at matches.

He cannot go within one mile of the Emirates stadium if Arsenal are playing four hours before and after the match, nor visit any town, city or London borough four hours before and after an away match. He must not go without two miles of any stadium where the England national team are playing four hours before and after the match.\n",

      "Hundreds of teenagers caused chaos in Carnaby Street, Soho after seeing an advert for a “free pop-up” by streetwear brands Poser London and Up In Flames. Shocking footage from the event shows crowds swarming a van as free clothes are thrown from it. Things quickly took a turn for the worse when the teens swarmed the police vans in attendance, with one boy seemingly stealing a police officer’s jacket and wearing it as he jumped up and down on a car. Chats of “f*** the feds” could be heard as the boys took control of the emergency vehicle.

At least two boys under the age of sixteen have been arrested on suspicion of theft, criminal damage and affray. One teen told the Metro he was “crushed” and “couldn’t breathe” as the mob of teenagers tried to get their hands on the free clothes. Others posted on TikTok claiming boys were punching each other in a bid to get an item. A Met spokesperson told LBC: “Police were called at 12:09hrs on Saturday, 22 February following reports of a large crowd gathering in Soho in relation to an apparent marketing stunt that had been advertised online. “During the incident, some of the crowd caused damage to an unattended police vehicle. Officers have since arrested two boys under the age of 16, on suspicion of theft from a motor vehicle, criminal damage and affray. They have been bailed whilst enquiries remain ongoing. “A Section 35 Dispersal Order for the borough of Westminster was put in place throughout the evening and no further related issues were reported.” Members of the public flooded social media with reactions to the scenes, with one X user writing: “What you're seeing in this video from London yesterday is the result of parental neglect, entitlement, and sheer stupidity fuelled by so-called ‘influencers’ who push reckless ideas - like giving away their tacky clothing lines (Poser X, Up In Flames, etc.)” Another said: 'The police are now reaping what they sow. Well done for being so weak!” While a third fumed: “Need to bring in the army and sort these animals out.” Poser London and Up in Flames are both “anti-fast fashion” brands that have held a number of these free pop-ups in recent months. This is the first to cause such shocking scenes.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The MP, who has been sitting as an independent since he was suspended by Labour following his arrest, was caught on camera punching a constituent near a taxi rank in the village of Frodsham last October. He pleaded guilty at a hearing in January to assaulting 45-year-old Paul Fellows. The court heard Amesbury had been drinking before he arrived at the rank, where Mr Fellows approached him to remonstrate about a bridge closure in the town. Footage showed Amesbury punch Mr Fellows to the head, knocking him to the ground, then follow him onto the road and start to punch him again, at least five times. The 55-year-old has been sitting as the independent for Runcorn and Helsby since his arrest - it could lead to a by-election for the constituency. If 10% of his constituents sign a recall petition it would force a by-election. However, an MP losing their seat as a result of a recall petition does not stop them from standing in any resulting by-election. People are disqualified from standing as an MP if they receive a prison sentence of over a year.  Alison Storey, Senior Specialist Prosecutor with the CPS Special Crime Division, said: “This was a persistent assault by Mike Amesbury which continued while the victim was on the floor, offering no aggression.    “The victim was alone and not part of a group and CCTV footage showed that he was not being threatening or aggressive towards Mike Amesbury.    “After the initial punch which knocked the victim to the ground, Mike Amesbury struck the victim at least a further five times while he was on the floor.    “The CPS will always seek to prosecute violent offences in accordance with our legal test regardless of who the perpetrator is.” Sentencing deputy senior district judge Tan Ikram said: \"In this case an immediate custodial sentence is, in my judgment, necessary as a punishment and a deterrent.\" After passing sentence Richard Derby, representing Amesbury, asked the judge: \"Is that an immediate sentence?\"  \t The judge nodded, replied: \"Yes,\" and left the courtroom.  \t Amesbury was joined in the dock by two security guards to take him down to the cells.  \t From there he will be taken to HMP Altcourse in Liverpool.  Unlike many defendants, he did not appear to have a brought a bag of belongings with him.  \t But Mr Derby then requested the judge come back into court as he wished to make an application for bail for Amesbury, pending an appeal against his sentence.  \t Judge Ikram returned to court, sat down, paused briefly and said: \"Application refused.\"\n",

      "Axel Rudakubana, 18, murdered Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine, Bebe King, six, and Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, at a Taylor Swift-themed class in the Merseyside town in July last year, when he was 17.  Rudakubana - who was jailed for a minimum of 52 years in January - attempted to murder eight other children, who cannot be named for legal reasons, as well as businessman John Hayes and class instructor Leanne Lucas.  In a new interview, Ms Lucas described how she was able to get herself and several children out of the room, despite suffering stab wounds to her spine, head, ribs, lung and shoulder blade.  She told the BBC: \"(Rudakubana) opened the door and just grabbed a child. I didn't know what he was doing.  \"He then grabbed the next child. And the next child. And then I shout: 'Who is that?'  \"Then I struggle to get that part of the memory back because he moves from the girls at the table and he moves over to right next to me.  \"I just felt something go in my back ... and my brain just said: He's got me. So he got me and then he got me again.  \"But I just knew that if I didn't get out, everyone was going to die.\"  Ms Lucas sustained five stab wounds to her spine, head, ribs, lung and shoulder blade.  Despite this, the yoga instructor and her friend, dance teacher Heidi Liddle, were able to get several children out of the room. Last year she told LBC the attack made her ‘lose faith in the world’. She shared her story with LBC at a candle-lit vigil in memory of the women and girls who have lost their lives to male violence in Merseyside. She had never previously spoken about the attack. “It has just made us feel very unsafe,\" she admitted. “My purpose was creating wellbeing events for children and families, and for that to happen where I was, and for the words I spoke and the children spoke, for that to be trampled over has really dampened all of our spirits. “It left us feeling unsafe, feeling like we just lost faith in the world.\" Read more: British husband 'likely killed ex-pat wife in France during staged home burglary gone wrong,’ prosecutors say Read more: Zelenskyy hails 'absolute heroism' of the Ukrainian people on third anniversary of Russian invasion  Rudakubana's 52-year jail term is one of the highest on record, and is thought to be the longest punishment handed to a killer of his age. Sir Keir Starmer said the atrocity in Southport was \"one of the most harrowing moments in our country's history\", and \"this vile offender will likely never be released\". He added: \"We owe it to these innocent young girls and all those affected to deliver the change that they deserve.\" Police discovered a number of devices during a search of Rudakubana's home in Banks, Lancashire. The 18-year-old cleared his internet history before he left to travel to The Hart Space just after 11am. A search on social media site X for the stabbing of Bishop Mar Mari Emmanuel, made minutes before he left home, was the only thing that remained, police have said. The FBI and US Department of Justice have since agreed to help UK police investigate Rudakubana.  Speaking about life since the attack, Ms Lucas said: \"I found out he'd pleaded guilty on the news ... it's hard, because I felt so angry. \"We knew he did it. He knew he did it. Every single person knew he did it. And he waited until the day of trial to say: 'Guilty', and put every single family, victim, witness, everyone in that position. \"It's so shocking at how much evidence they had on him, at how he slipped through the net. Like, you know, when he was found with a knife on a bus. \"I mean I struggle to hear that and I don't imagine what the bereaved families feel when they hear stuff like that.\"\n",

      "Cyclists in Regent's Park are being attacked by gangs of thieves who forcibly remove them from their bikes, they say - and police won't do anything early in the morning.\n",
      "Cyclists in the central London park are being attacked by balaclava-clad men on motorbikes in the darkness - leaving many now terrified to go out. Regent's Park is closed to cars from 5.45-7.45am, which previously made it a haven for biking clubs, of which there are now over 30. But in recent years, bike thieves have started operating at this time, when it is still dark and cyclists are easier to prey upon. In the year to December 2023, some 768 violent attacks on cyclists were recorded each week across London - the equivalent of 15 such assaults every week.

Sean Epstein, of the Regent's Park Cyclists group, said: \"What is special about Regent's Park is that it's shut to cars in the morning. There are main through roads [to the park] in the mornings. \"Mopeds just stand and wait - two people on a moped of motorbike - plates removed, with masks or balaclavas. 'Most robbers kick riders off their bikes while they're riding and wrestle their bikes off them.'Last winter the robberies kept increasing.  \"Our clubs were getting hit on a weekly basis. \"It's always the same method and the same response from the police: treating it like stolen property, shrugging and saying, \"Sorry, we've got no leads.. You should get insurance\". \"It has led to a general fear and inability for people to feel safe.\" Last month LBC's Johnny Jenkins recounted how he had been attacked by 'bikejackers' in the park. \"Two masked thugs on electric bikes approached me, demanding I hand over my bike,\" he wrote. \"I let out a piercing scream – I couldn’t believe this was happening. It felt like I’d been thrown into a nightmare I couldn’t wake up from.\" Police were no use and so he was left out over £1,000 out of pocket because of the stolen bike. Another cyclist told of how he was attacked by men on a moped. I was meeting some friends in the park and was a bit early so did a lap by myself,\" he told The Times. \"A moped pulled up with two men on and one started looking at the brand. I knew I was in trouble so turned around and so did they. They told me to \"get off the f***ing bike\" \"Someone called the police and they were there in about five minutes. They said it was the third or fourth call that morning.  \"Cyclists are really scared.\"\n",

      "A British man found dead alongside his wife at their home in rural France likely killed her during a botched staged burglary, police believe.\n",
      "The bodies of Andrew Searle and his wife Dawn were found in the hamlet of Les Pesquies, near Toulouse. Mrs Searle was found on February 6, lying dead in their garden with jewellery scattered around her. Mr Searle was found dead inside the house. Police initially believed that Mrs Searle had tried to run away from an attacker and was beaten to death.  However an investigator has now disputed this theory, saying neighbours would have heard screams if this was true. “What is very likely is that the victim was killed inside the house, with doors and windows shut on a winter's night, and then her body dumped in the garden,” an investigator told The Sunday Post.

He said that if the couple had been attacked by a stranger, they would have probably shouted, alerting their neighbours. He claimed that Mr Searle may have hoped he could explain the crime to the police by organising a staged burglary before changing his mind and taking his own life. No arrests have been made in connection with the couple's deaths.\n",

      "A man attacked people with a knife at a canal market in Mulhouse, near the German border in Eastern France on Saturday afternoon. The attack, which has left a Portuguese man dead and several others injured, has been called an Islamist terror attack by French President Emmanuel Macron. Seven police officers were wounded, including a parking control agent admitted to hospital with serious injuries, the prosecutor's office said.

The interior minister described him as an Islamic extremist with a schizophrenic profile. Two of his family members and a person who lodged him were also detained, the prosecutor's office said. Macron said the government has \"complete determination\" to respond to the attack, which he blamed on ''Islamist terrorism\". The attacker repeatedly said \"Allahu akbar\",  \"God is great\" in Arabic, the prosecutor said. He was armed with a knife and a screwdriver.

Police experts had \"detected a schizophrenic profile\" in the suspect, he added. After several months in prison for that conviction, the suspect was confined to house arrest as authorities sought to expel him to Algeria. Mr Retailleau criticised Algeria for resisting the return of criminals France is seeking to deport. The French government will convene a special meeting on Wednesday about immigration in the wake of the attack, foreign minister Jean-Noel Barrot said on Sunday. They will notably study 19 countries \"where we have the most difficulty in returning people without papers\", Mr Barrot said on Europe-1 radio.

Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau has said that Amra had connections with Marseille's organised crime syndicates and was suspected of heading a drug trafficking network. Amra's first offences occurred between the ages of 11 and 14, according to the prosecutor. Nicknamed La Mouche (The Fly), Amra has also been referred to by other aliases such as Yanis, Momo and Schtroumpf (Smurf).

An officer was also seen tending to his colleague lying on the floor and surrounded in blood.

      "Natasha Conneely was working as part of the offender management unit at Bedfordshire Police in May 2023 when it was discovered she had started a relationship with a known burglar, the force said. Bedfordshire Police said its Professional Standards Department investigated and found messages between the pair, and that Conneely had removed the offender's electronic tag in April so he could visit her home without being traced. Afterwards, Conneely would check the systems to ensure their whereabouts had not been tracked, the force said. Read more: Vatican releases update on the Pope as he remains in hospital It was later discovered the pair had spent the night together in a hotel in Leeds in June. Conneely was charged with corrupt or other improper exercise of police powers and privileges, in breach of Section 26 of the Criminal Justice and Courts Act 2015. She admitted the charge and on Friday was sentenced to 18 months in prison at St Albans Crown Court. Bedfordshire Police said Conneely resigned from the force and a November 2023 tribunal found her behaviour amounted to gross misconduct and ruled she would have been dismissed had she not already quit. Conneely was put on the College of Policing's Barred List, banning her from returning to policing, the force confirmed. Chief Constable Trevor Rodenhurst said: \"Natasha Conneely was part of a team responsible for the monitoring and management of offenders who are in our community. \"The team manages the risk of these individuals through tagging and other means to deter reoffending and assist their rehabilitation into society. \"Becoming involved in a sexual relationship with such an offender was totally inappropriate and her actions to allow them to spend time together undetected were entirely selfish and had real potential to leave the offender free to further offend with no safeguards in place.

      "A man who had his credit card stolen is appealing to the thieves to come forward, so they can split the winnings. The scratchcard won them €500,000 (£414,000). They bought the winning tickets in Toulouse, France. The victim had his backpack stolen from his car in early February, and was identified by police as Jean-David E. He reportedly asked his bank to block the credit card, but it has already been used to buy the scratchcard. \"It's an incredible story, but it's all true,\" he said.

He said \"Time is working against us. \"You risk nothing... we will share with you. \"And you would be able to change your lives.\"\n",

      "The suspect in a stabbing attack at Berlin's Holocaust Memorial that seriously injured a Spanish tourist is a Syrian refugee who apparently wanted to kill Jews, investigators said.\n",
      "The Spanish tourist was sustained life-threatening injuries after being stabbed in the neck with a knife at Berlin's Holocaust memorial at around 6 pm on Friday. The 19-year-old suspect was arrested on Friday evening, nearly three hours after the attack, when he approached officers with blood on his hands and clothes. The 30-year-old victim underwent an emergency operation and was put into an artificial coma for a while, and his life is no longer in danger, investigators said. The suspect arrived in Germany in 2023 as an unaccompanied minor and successfully applied for asylum, investigators said. He lives in Leipzig. The attack took place two days before a German national election in which migration has become a top issue, pushed to the forefront by five deadly attacks involving immigrants over the past nine months. The investigation so far points to a link between the attack and the conflict in the Middle East, police and prosecutors said. Read more: Ukraine has 'no cards left to play' Trump claims as he slams Starmer for 'doing nothing' to end Russia's war They added that evidence so far, particularly from what he told police in questioning, suggests that he had decided in the last few weeks to kill Jews. That was apparently why he chose to mount the attack at the memorial dedicated to the six million Jews killed in the Holocaust. At the time of his arrest, he was carrying a backpack containing a prayer mat, a Koran, a sheet with verses from the Koran as well as Friday's date, and the knife apparently used in the attack. Investigators were working to determine whether the suspect suffered from mental illness. They said he was not previously known to police or judicial authorities in Berlin. He is under investigation on suspicion of attempted murder and bodily harm. The memorial first opened in 2005 and is made up of more than 2,700 concrete slabs of varying heights paying tribute to the six million Jewish victims of the Holocaust. This comes just days after more than 30 people were injured and two died after a Mini Cooper was driven into a crowd of activists in Munich. The woman, 37, and her child passed away after being rushed to hospital following the incident. \n",

      "Pregnant prisoners have given birth handcuffed to male officers, in a breach of the Ministry of Justice policy.\n",
      "At least two women were made to give birth while handcuffed between 2021 and 2023. According to an investigation by The Times, both incidents occurred at HMP Bronzefield in Surrey.  The women allege they were handcuffed sometimes during antenatal appointments, vaginal examinations, and during labour. One female prisoner said she was restrained during antenatal appointments, and for 48 hours while in labour - sometimes handcuffed to male staff. \"Being handcuffed and without any privacy, including being chained to a male prison officer, made me feel humiliated and degraded. \"Yes, I had broken the law, but I was still a pregnant woman. I feel I was treated as less than an animal,” she told The Times. She added: “My treatment during labour has had a lasting impact on me; so much so that I feel I am not the same person any more. No matter what I do, I feel as though I will never be able to move past this.” The newspaper said that lawyers, from Bhatt Murphy Solicitors, believe a number of other women have been affected also, in a systematic issue inside the female prison. The women are calling for an independent investigation into their treatment by the justice secretary, Shabana Mahmood. The Ministry of Justice policy rules that pregnant women must not be restrained while attending medical appointments - unless there are exceptional circumstances. \"Escort chains\" are permitted if required, for women to have confidential interactions with health professionals. Read More: Three brothers jailed for sexually abusing and grooming dozens of young girls in Leeds Read More: Urgent hunt for missing runner, 23, as police become 'increasingly concerned' for her safety One woman in HMP Brozefield, speaking to Channel 4, said that she was \"doubled over\" having contractions, \"sobbing\" to be released from the handcuffs. She said she was handcuffed to an officer while showering, sleeping, and using the toilet. She said: “By the time they took the handcuffs off me, I was screaming, begging for an epidural, which I really didn’t want. \"I feel like my birth was taken away from me. It was evil and it was awful and I would like them to stop doing that to women.” Co-director of the campaign group Level Up said: “The government must end the imprisonment of pregnant women.  \"Cuffing was outlawed in 1996, yet prison officers still continue to abuse their power over vulnerable women.  \"Several other countries have laws against imprisoning pregnant women and mothers and England must urgently catch up.” Sodexo Justice Services, the contracted management of HMP Bronzefield, told The Times: \"These are historical claims relating to the security arrangements surrounding pregnant prisoners whilst on escort outside of the prison. These claims are subject to ongoing legal proceedings, which means that we are unable to provide any specific comment on individual cases. “We take the safety and wellbeing of the women in our care, and of the general public, very seriously and have robust assurance systems in place to ensure that current practice is fully within the guidelines appropriate to these situations.” A Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said to the newspaper: “The Lord Chancellor has launched the Women’s Justice Board so that fewer women end up in prison, particularly those who are pregnant or mothers. “Our policy is pregnant women should not be restrained unless a risk assessment has deemed it essential to do so and we are looking into what has happened in these cases.”\n",

      "Jenny Hall, 23, was last seen leaving her home in Barracks Farm, Tow Law, shortly after 3pm on Tuesday. In an update on Friday, Durham Constabulary said her last known location was on the B6278 between Stanhope and Eggleston - where her red Ford Focus was parked. Police are now using specialist drones to search for Hall - and have asked volunteers not to join. Officers are now saying they are becoming \"increasingly concerned\" for her safety, with the runner described as a white female, 6-foot tall and has dark brown hair. Several expert mountain rescue search teams and air support have joined the operation, with police dogs and mountain rescue teams searching for a missing runner in County Durham. Durham Police said it would be working in Hamsterley Forest and the surrounding areas, where \"Jenny likes to run through\". Read more: Mystery of ‘severed hand’ found near school in Dublin Read more: Three brothers jailed for sexually abusing and grooming dozens of young girls in Leeds Digital intelligence officers have also conducted enquiries on Ms Hall's mobile phone, smart watch and running apps, with the hope they may reveal her location. However, the force has said \"none have yielded any results unfortunately\". Police say the search continues despite the \"challenging weather conditions and terrain\". Teeside and Wearside Police are searching a 100 mile area for any sign of the runner, with the local community out in force as they attempt to locate her. In a statement posted to facebook, Durham Constabulary said: \"A major search continues today for missing Jenny Hall.  Specialised sniffer dogs are being used in the area around Jenny's last known location where her car was parked, on the B6278 between Stanhope and Eggleston. \"The search today is concentrating on running trails Jenny frequently uses between Eggleston and Hamsterley.  The force added: \"Her family have now confirmed she may have also been carrying a green jacket and had her hair up in a ponytail. Chief Inspector Dean Haythornthwaite, of Durham Constabulary, said: “We have become increasingly concerned for Jenny since she was reported missing on Tuesday and have been exploring all lines of enquiry, including dozens from members of the public. “We are focussing our search on areas we know Jenny likes to run through and we are determined to do everything we can to find her. “I would like to thank everyone who is working around-the-clock in our search and efforts to reunite Jenny with her family.”  Anyone who believes they may have seen Jenny or has any relevant information about her whereabouts is asked to contact police immediately on 999.\n",

      "The haunting finals words of the man suspected of shooting his wife dead on Valentine’s Day have been revealed. Lisa Smith, 43, from Slough, was killed in Knockholt near The Three Horseshoes pub just after 7pm last Friday, Kent Police said. A man, thought to be Edvard Stockings, fled the scene in a car and is believed to have entered the River Thames shortly after Smith’s death. Stockings reportedly called his best friend, Leslie Thompson, to confess to shooting his wife, according to MailOnline. \"She's dead. I can't live - we've all gone together. I'll see you on the other side.\", the suspect told Thompson. Stockings told his friend that he \"loved him\" and sobbed uncontrollably.  Thompson said: 'He told me what he had done and I could not speak.' Read more: Three brothers jailed for sexually abusing and grooming dozens of young girls in Leeds This comes as a body, believed to be Stockings, was spotted in the River Thames yesterday. The force believes the man fell from the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge which crosses the Thames at Dartford 17 miles away. A car containing a handgun was found abandoned on the bridge and a man was seen on the wrong side of the barrier, but his body has yet to be found. DCI David Higham told KentOnline the force has “good, reliable witness evidence” that the alleged killer had entered the River Thames. He added there had been a sighting of the body last Saturday but it \"became submerged again\" before police could begin a recovery. “It gives me total confidence the suspect has fallen into the river. We had a very large search parameter under the Dartford Crossing,” he continued. At around midday last Saturday, we did have a sighting of a body. \"Unfortunately, we were unable to recover it before it became submerged again but I am confident from the description that it is the suspect for our offence.” Read more: Mystery of ‘severed hand’ found near school in Dublin In a statement, Detective Chief Inspector Higham said: \"This murder has led to the senseless loss of a beloved daughter and mother and our thoughts remain with Lisa's family.\" The landlady of The Three Horseshoes Michelle Thomas described customers \"screaming, shouting and crying\" as they realised what had happened. About 30 people were at the pub for dinner, while 20 more were in the bar as the incident unfolded just after 7pm, she said. Landlady Michelle Thomas, told LBC: \"I heard two bang bangs. I say 'bang bang' because that's what I heard and I thought it was fireworks. She added: \"But then my son came in and said, \"something's going on in the car park\".\n",

      "The mastermind of an armed robbery that ended in the murder of Pc Sharon Beshenivsky has died in jail, less than a year after he was sentenced.\n",
      "Piran Ditta Khan was jailed last May. He was the final member of the gang responsible for the armed raid which ended in Pc Sharon Beshenivsky's murder to be convicted - having spent nearly 15 years on the run. A Prison Service spokesperson confirmed his death on Friday, saying: \"HMP Wakefield prisoner Piran Ditta Khan died on Friday February 21. As with all deaths in custody, the Prison and Probation Ombudsman will investigate.\" Pc Beshenivsky was murdered on her daughter's fourth birthday while interrupting a robbery at family-run Universal Express travel agents in Bradford, West Yorkshire, in November 2005. Khan had fled to Pakistan after the killing at the age of 57, and evaded justice until he was caught in 2020. Read more: Donald Trump says Putin and Zelenskyy 'need to work together' as he denies he's planning 'trip to Moscow' Read more: Man seriously injured in stabbing at Berlin Holocaust Memorial as police hunt suspect Pc Beshenivsky and her colleague Pc Teresa Milburn, who were both unarmed, were shot at point-blank range by one of the three men who had just carried out the raid as he emerged from the door of the business. In April 2024, Khan became the last of seven men involved in the robbery to be convicted. The 76-year-old was found guilty at Leeds Crown Court of murdering Pc Beshenivsky, as well as two counts of possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life and two counts of possession of a prohibited weapon. Last May, Mr Justice Hilliard jailed Khan for life with a minimum term of 40 years. During his trial, jurors heard Khan was the only one of the group who was familiar with Universal Express and had used the firm in the past to send money to family in Pakistan. He flew to Pakistan two months after Pc Beshenivsky's death and remained at liberty there until he was arrested by Pakistani authorities in January 2020 and then extradited to the UK in 2023. Sentencing him last year, Mr Justice Hilliard told Khan: \"You will inevitably spend the remainder of your life in custody, but that is a consequence of sentencing a man of your age for a crime of this particular gravity.\" In a statement to the court, Paul Beshenivsky, who had been married to Pc Beshenivsky for four years when she died, said: \"The way we lost Sharon was in the most brutal, callous and futile way. \"She never came home due to the actions and organisation of one person - Piran Ditta Khan.\"\n",

      "Hadi Matar, 27, has been found guilty of attempted murder and assault in the August 2022 attack at the Chautauqua Institution in western New York and could now face more than 30 years behind bars. Sir Salman, 77, survived the attack but suffered damage to his liver, loss of vision in one eye and damage to nerve endings in his arm. During the two-week trial, the Booker Prize-winning author told jurors he thought he was dying when a masked stranger ran onto the stage and stabbed and slashed at him until being tackled by bystanders. Sir Salman showed jurors his now-blinded right eye, usually hidden behind a darkened lens. Jurors also heard from a trauma surgeon who said Sir Salman's injuries would have been fatal without quick treatment, and a law enforcement officer who said Matar was calm and co-operative in his custody. Read more: Man seriously injured in stabbing at Berlin Holocaust Memorial as police hunt suspect They were shown video of the assault and aftermath that was captured from multiple angles by Chautauqua Institution cameras. The recordings also picked up the gasps and screams from audience members who had been seated to hear Sir Salman speak with City of Asylum Pittsburgh founder Henry Reese about keeping writers safe. Mr Reese suffered a gash to his forehead. From the witness stand, institution staff and others present that day pointed to Matar as the assailant. Stabbed and slashed more than a dozen times in the head, throat, torso, thigh and hand, Sir Salman spent 17 days at a Pennsylvania hospital and more than three weeks at a New York City rehabilitation centre. He detailed his long and painful recovery in his 2024 memoir, Knife. Throughout the trial, Matar often took notes with a pen and sometimes laughed or smiled with defence attorneys during breaks in testimony. His lawyers declined to call any witnesses of their own and Matar did not testify in his defence. Public Defender Nathaniel Barone said Matar likely would have faced a lesser charge of assault were it not for Sir Salman's celebrity. \"We think that it became an attempted murder because of the notoriety of the alleged victim in the case,\" Mr Barone told reporters after testimony concluded on Thursday. \"That's been it from the very beginning. It's been nothing more, nothing less. And it's for publicity purposes. It's for self-interest purposes.\" Matar’s sentencing has been scheduled for 23 April.\n",

Samantha Yelland, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said: “Our thoughts remain with Elijah and Marley’s family and friends who have been completely devastated by their loss.  “It is unimaginable to think what those poor children went through in their final moments. It is a parent’s job to keep their children safe and Kara Alexander not only failed to do that, but robbed them of their lives.” \tDetective Chief Inspector Paul Waller, who led the investigation, said: \"Our thoughts are with the family, especially the boys' father who found them dead when he went to collect them for the weekend after Kara Alexander had failed to return his messages.  \t\"No parent should have to go through such a horrific experience, and then have to listen to the detailed evidence highlighting what led up to these events.  \t\"I would also like to praise those who were first on scene - our colleagues and the paramedics - who also experienced this traumatic event first-hand.  \t\"This has been a difficult investigation for everyone involved. This guilty verdict cannot turn back the clock but it does provide the children's family with some form of resolution.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "Charles will travel to the death camp to mark the 80th anniversary of its liberation as the world pays tribute to victims and survivors on Holocaust Memorial Day. He will join survivors and other dignitaries invited to a service at the site of the former concentration camp in Poland on Monday, also meeting the country's President Andrzej Duda during his brief visit. It is not Charles’ first time visiting Poland but it will be the first time a reigning monarch has visited the site of one of the Nazi regimes’ most despicable crimes. Charles’ son, the Prince of Wales, will attend commemoration services in London in the King’s absence. It comes as Sir Keir Starmer is set to speak of the \"collective endeavour\" to defeat the \"hatred of difference\" on Holocaust Memorial Day. In a statement, the PM will pay tribute to the six million Jewish people murdered by the Nazi regime and renewed his commitment to ensure all schools across the country teach students about the genocide. \"The Holocaust was a collective endeavour by thousands of ordinary people utterly consumed by the hatred of difference,\" Sir Keir is expected to say. \"That is the hatred we stand against today and it is a collective endeavour for all of us to defeat it. \"We must start by remembering the six million Jewish victims and by defending the truth against anyone who would deny it.\" “As we remember, we must also act,\" the PM is expected to add, pointing other atrocities in Cambodia, Rwanda, Bosnia and Darfur which followed the Holocaust. \"Today, we have to make those words mean more. We will make Holocaust education a truly national endeavour. \"We will ensure all schools teach it and seek to give every young person the opportunity to hear a recorded survivor testimony, because by learning from survivors we can develop that empathy for others and that appreciation of our common humanity, which is the ultimate way to defeat the hatred of difference. \"It happened, it can happen again: that is the warning of the Holocaust to us all. And it's why it is a duty for all of us to make 'never again' finally mean what it says: never again.\" The Prime Minister has also visited Auschwitz earlier this month, where he vowed to fight the \"poison of antisemitism\". On Wednesday, he welcomed a group of survivors and their families to Downing Street, describing the meeting as \"an incredible privilege\" and praising their \"sheer and remarkable courage\". Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch highlighted the importance of combating the “resurgence of antisemitism today” as she reflected on the “unique evil” of the Holocaust. Meanwhile, Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey called on Britain to guard against “antisemitism, hatred, discrimination and oppression.”\n",

      "Like all families who celebrate the occasion the Royals have their own Christmas traditions and quirks.\n",
      "From black-tie dinners to traditional Christmas games, here is how the Royal Family spends the festive season. We also look at the familiar faces that may be missing from this year’s festivities be it from family feuds or from bizarre connections to alleged Chinese spies. Read more: Prince Andrew won't join Royal Family at Sandringham Christmas amid Chinese ‘spy’ scandal For the King Charles and his sprawling family, celebrations begin on Christmas Eve. Most of the family, not including Prince Andrew this year due to his latest scandal, will arrive at Sandringham before 4pm on Christmas Eve. As the different members of the Firm arrive, the King, Queen and their relatives will enjoy a traditional afternoon tea. In a nod to their German heritage, the Royals will then open some, but not all, of their Christmas presents. After that, it’s time for dinner. It will be a black-tie affair, according to Prince Harry’s bombshell memoir Spare, where the royals gather at what he described as a \"long table covered with white cloth and white name cards.\" At the dinner, the Royal staff will serve the late Queen’s favourite cocktail - Zaza. On Christmas morning, the Royals enjoy a traditional English-cooked breakfast and with as many as 45 relatives in attendance, it’s sure to be a feast. Some family members sometimes prefer to eat their breakfast alone or with their children, including the Prince and Princess of Wales. According to reports, Will and Kate will spend the early morning with their three children, George, Charlotte and Louis. After breakfast, the children will be given the rest of their Christmas presents. Now it’s time for the Royals to head to church and do their traditional Christmas day walkabout. Every year you will see pictures of the Royal Family making the short walk to St Mary Magdalene church in Sandringham. The King and the rest of the Firm arrive at the famous chapel at 11am - as hundreds of Royals fans gather outside to get a glimpse of them. After the church service, it’s time for lunch. And the Royal Family’s Christmas dinner is just as extravagant as you may expect. From turkey to roast potatoes, pigs in blankets and Christmas Pudding, the meal will feature all the traditional dishes we’ve come to expect over the years. In his book, Prince Harry explained that the children usually eat separately from the adults - a quirk some may find strange in this day and age. \"It was the same meal every year. They're actually boring when it comes to festivities! They didn't do hams or anything, just traditional turkeys,” former chef Darren McGrady told Hello! Magazine. \"We did three turkeys for the Queen and her family in the royal dining room, one for the children's nursery and then more for the 100 or so staff, so everyone had a Christmas lunch.” Once everyone is full, the Royals, like so many families across the UK, will sit down to watch the King’s 3pm speech. As evening approaches, the Royals usually sit down together to play games and enjoy each other's company, with the late Queen being partial to a round of charades, according to reports. While around 60 Royals once attended Christmas celebrations at Sandringham, that number has fallen in recent years. King Charles’ estranged son Harry, his wife Meghan and their two children Archie and Lilibet, will be spending Christmas in the United States. The Duke of Sussex reportedly hasn’t even received an invite to join the rest of his family. The King’s brother Andrew will also be missing this year. It comes as he once again found himself in hot water after being linked to an alleged Chinese spy. Last Christmas, Andrew walked from Sandringham to church with the other royals - symbolic of his gradual rehabilitation within the monarchy. But this year, Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, Duchess of York, will reportedly miss the celebrations after being linked to a Chinese ‘spy’ who was his ‘close confidant’, staying at his home Royal Lodge instead. According to MailOnline, King Charles’ brother has voluntarily decided not to attend the celebrations so as not to embarrass the King any further. Both Andrew and Fergie’s daughters Beatrice and Eugenie had already excused themselves, opting instead to spend Christmas with their respective in-laws.\n",

      "Charles and Camilla attended a reception in the neighbourhood of Walthamstow, and greeted crowds who had gathered outside. The royal couple attended a celebration of community cohesion at Waltham Forest Town Hall. Asked \"How are you?\" by Sikh faith representative Harvinder Rattan, the King smiled as he replied: \"I'm still alive.\" The King was diagnosed with cancer after receiving treatment for a separate issue. He had undergone treatment for an enlarged prostate, and while Buckingham Palace has not clarified what form of cancer the monarch has, it is not prostate cancer. The King underwent treatment throughout 2024 with it set to continue into 2025, according to reports.

During the visit, Camilla donated 25 toys to Citizens UK, to be passed on to children living in asylum hotels, and a donation to a food bank was left on the King's behalf. The donation included Waitrose cartons of long-life milk, Christmas puddings, custard and mince pies. After listening to a performance by a children's choir, A Little Choir of Joy, Charles told them: \"I do hope you have a very happy Christmas.\" He then joked that the children in the choir, made up of eight to 12 year-olds from schools in the borough, should \"make the most of it\" for the \"poor teachers\". Charles was presented with a Christmas card from the choir, with messages written inside which included \"Your majesties, thank you so much for visiting us today\" and \"hope you enjoyed our singing\". Refreshments for the reception were provided by Haven Cafe, whose owner Usman Khalid is a former asylum seeker who trains refugees to be baristas. After disorder across some parts of the UK, thousands of people gathered in Walthamstow for a counter-demonstration on August 7, and those planning to protest outside an immigration centre failed to turn up. A Palace source told Sky News: \"His treatment has been moving in a positive direction and as a managed condition the treatment cycle will continue into next year\". The source added the Royals are optimistic about King Charles’ health, as he continues to undertake royal duties and attend engagements. Writing at the time of his diagnosis, the Palace said: \"During The King's recent hospital procedure for benign prostate enlargement, a separate issue of concern was noted. Subsequent diagnostic tests have identified a form of cancer. \"His Majesty has today commenced a schedule of regular treatments, during which time he has been advised by doctors to postpone public-facing duties. \"Throughout this period, His Majesty will continue to undertake State business and official paperwork as usual.\" 2024 has undoubtedly been a hard year for the Royals, with both the King and the Princess of Wales being diagnosed with cancer. Prince William has said that he had \"the hardest year\" of his life, branding his experience \"dreadful\". When asked about his year, William replied: \"Honestly, it's been dreadful. It's probably been the hardest year in my life. \"So, trying to get through everything else and keep everything on track has been really difficult. \"But I'm so proud of my wife, I'm proud of my father, for handling the things that they have done. \"But from a personal family point of view, it's been, yeah, it's been brutal.\"\n",

      "King Charles’ coronation cost British taxpayers £72 million, official account records have revealed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The coronation of King Charles in May 2023 was described as a “once-in-a-generation” event and, despite being scaled back from previous crownings, saw all the pomp and circumstance one would expect from a royal coronation. The £72 million figure includes £50.3 million of Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) costs and £21.7 million for the Home Office for policing the event. Dignitaries from across the globe attended the ceremony at Westminster Abbey, with a star-studded concert in Windsor following the next day. According to the foreign office, representatives from 90 countries attended the ceremony, including the First Ladies of Ukraine and the United States. The concert saw acts Take That, Olly Murs, Katy Perry and Lionel Richie perform to a massive crowd. The DCMS annual report and accounts said the department \"successfully delivered on the central weekend of His Majesty King Charles III's Coronation, enjoyed by many millions both in the UK and across the globe\". DCMS was the lead government department working with the royal household on the coronation, which it described as a \"once-in-a-generation moment which provided an occasion for the entire country to come together in celebration, and offered a unique opportunity to celebrate and strengthen our national identity and showcase the UK to the world\". King Charles’ crowning cost significantly less than the Queen’s funeral and the events surrounding it. According to account documents Queen Elizabeth’s funeral cost  £162m - £74m for the Home Office and £57m for the DCMS as well as extra cash for devolved governments. At the time, the King’s coronation had been described as a “slimmed-down affair” with the royal family looking to avoid flaunting its wealth in the wake of the rapidly worsening cost of living crisis. Prior to the crowning, a poll carried out by YouGov showed 52% of Londoners felt the taxpayer should not foot the bill for Charles’ coronation.\n",

      "King Charles shared a traditional greeting with a Maori advocate as he launched a new environmental charity on Thursday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Charles, 76, shared a hongi - a traditional Maori greeting where two people press their noses together - with Mere Takoko, the co-founder of Pacific Whale Fund. It came as he launched his environmental charity, the King's Circular Bioeconomy Alliance (CBA). The gesture was described as “hugely symbolic” by Ms Takoko. Speaking after she greeted the King, Ms Takoko, who came from Gisborne in the upper North Island of New Zealand, said it was \"vitally important\" for her to greet Charles. \"I came here in the spirit of reconciliation, friendship, and unity,\" she said. Talking about the late Maori King Tuheitia, who died in August this year, Ms Takoko said: \"From the Maori king's perspective, they enjoyed a very strong friendship and this legacy must be maintained. \"We are two peoples but bound together through the treaty of Waitangi, which his ancestors signed, and my ancestors signed.\" The CBA was originally established in 2020 but became officially recognised as a charity last year. It aims to aid the move to a “climate neutral economy” across the globe. Talking about the late Maori King Tuheitia, who died in August this year, Ms Takoko said: \"From the Maori king's perspective, they enjoyed a very strong friendship and this legacy must be maintained. \"We are two peoples but bound together through the treaty of Waitangi, which his ancestors signed, and my ancestors signed.\" She added that she wanted to \"continue to celebrate that relationship at a time which is quite divisive\". It comes amid massive protests by the Maori people in New Zealand over a controversial law seeking to reinterpret the country's 1840 Treaty of Waitangi between British colonisers and Maori people, which many critics say is an attempt to take rights away from Maori people. During the reception, Charles greeted the CBA's founders and trustees in the Throne Room of St James's Palace, before moving on to the Entree room to speak to attendees. At one point, the King stopped to admire a pashmina produced by the fashion brand Brunello Cucinelli using fine wool from Ladakh in the Indian Himalayas that has been produced through regenerative farming. \"It's amazing, isn't it?\" he said, touching the fabric. Charles was also shown cotton grown in Puglia, southern Italy, to produce T-shirts made by Armani. One of these T-shirts has been sent to the King as a gift, along with one of the pashminas.\n",

      "Charles, 76, was reportedly in good spirits as he arrived at the Commando Training Centre Royal Marines in Lympstone, near Exeter, Devon on Friday. He attended the training centre in 1974 to complete three days of commando training there as part of his pilot training. The King, who is Captain General of the Royal Marines, met his troops and presented the King's Badge and a Green Beret to two trainees. Addressing the recruits, he said: “As your Captain General, I can only express my pride in each and every one of you, together with my admiration for passing such a demanding course. “We are fortunate indeed to be able to rely on you, as well as on those families here today who so loyally support you.” It was the first time a king has presented the badge since his grandfather, King George VI, in 1939.

Marine Stephens, 20, was selected despite previously picking up a serious injury. After ten months recuperating, he resumed his training this autumn and completed his final five weeks to earn the badge. “This moment will stay with me forever. I know the last time a King presented the King's Badge was back in 1939, it's quite daunting to think that I will be only the second Royal Marine to enjoy that honour,” he said. The King also met 100-year-old D-Day veteran Norman Ashford, a coxswain on a landing craft who did numerous runs up Gold Beach. Mr Ashford said: “It was a great honour to meet the King, I haven't met royalty before and I just turned 100 on the 10th. It was a great pleasure to be back at the Commando Training Centre.” His Majesty was also presented with a picture of himself tackling the high ropes at the training centre, while he watched recruits perform the same manoeuvre.\n",

      "William and Kate posted online: \"Wishing a very Happy Birthday to His Majesty The King!\" alongside a picture of Charles smiling while wearing a garland and sunglasses on a recent royal trip to Australia and Samoa with The Queen. Charles is celebrating his 76th birthday, marking the occasion with a visit to a surplus food festival. He is treating the day as a normal working one and carrying on with his duties despite facing a personally challenging year in which both he and the Princess of Wales were diagnosed with cancer. The monarch will open the first two Coronation Food Hubs on the first anniversary of the launch of his Coronation Food Project, designed to bridge the gap between food need and food waste in the UK amid the cost-of-living crisis. He will head to Deptford in south London to formally unveil the first hub, tour the centre with London Mayor Sadiq Khan, and attend the surplus food festival being staged to celebrate the royal visit, before virtually opening another hub in Merseyside. The event will be a solo one for Charles, with the Queen, who had hoped to join him, still recovering from a nasty chest infection. The King, in black tie, walked the red carpet on the eve of his birthday, meeting stars Denzel Washington, Paul Mescal and Pedro Pascal at the glitzy global premiere of Gladiator II. On Wednesday afternoon, he hosted a special celebrity reception at Buckingham Palace in honour of the UK's film and television industry, where he and Camilla, who attended for part of the event, chatted with a host of famous faces including actors Damian Lewis, Emily Mortimer and Lucien Laviscount, and Gladiator director Sir Ridley Scott. Gun salutes will be fired in Green Park by The King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery and at the Tower of London by the Honourable Artillery Company as part of the military's traditional celebrations on the sovereign's birthday, and bells will be rung at Westminster Abbey where the King was crowned in 2023. Pharmacies could close on evenings and weekends as owners protest over funding Polish inmates languishing in UK jails face being sent back home in bid to free up prison space Charles, like his late mother Elizabeth II, has two birthdays, his actual one on November 14, and his official one, which falls on the second Saturday in June. Since 1748, the monarch's official birthday has been marked by the parade known as Trooping the Colour, which was usually held on the king or queen's actual birthday. Edward VII, who reigned from 1901 to 1910, was born in the month of November. But he celebrated officially in May or June because there was less chance of it being cold and drizzly during the outdoor event. Charles's grandfather George VI, who was born in December, reintroduced the idea, and the late Queen Elizabeth II continued it, as has the King. Prince Charles Philip Arthur George was welcomed into the world on November 14 1948 at Buckingham Palace, the first child of the future Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh. As the Prince of Wales, he was the nation's longest serving heir to the throne, and he became King on September 8 2022 on the death of his mother, the late Queen. News of Charles' cancer, undisclosed in its form, came in February, after it was discovered while he was treated in hospital for an enlarged prostate in January. He cancelled all face-to-face public duties but returned in April and has since travelled to France for D-Day commemorations, hosted an incoming state visit for the Emperor of Japan, and undertaken a recent hectic tour to Australia and Samoa with the Queen, despite still undergoing outpatient cancer treatment.\n",

      "Prince Andrew is said to have come up with the money to stay in his home after King Charles cut him off financially.\n",
      "The King had earlier made the decisive move to cut his brother off, instructing the Keeper of the Privy Purse, the official in control of royal finances, to end his annual allowance, believed to be worth around £1 million. Andrew will also lose his multi-million-pound 24-hour private security deal. To keep his allowance, Charles had demanded Andrew leave his Royal Lodge and move into Frogmore Cottage, the former home of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, or be cut off. Andrew, however, refused to leave the lodge. Now he has found his own money to stay in the 30-room Windsor mansion and keep it up - an expensive undertaking.  The Keeper of the Privy Purse is satisfied that the money comes from legitimate sources, the Times reported. A source told the paper: “If Andrew can pay for his own upkeep with legitimate means, then it is not an issue.  \"But the King’s patience has run out when it comes to funding his brother’s lifestyle in a way that does not fit his status.” Read more: King axes disgraced Duke's security team as pressure mounts on Prince Andrew to leave Royal Lodge mansion Andrew's private security has been privately funded by Charles after he lost publicly-funded police protection in 2022 amid allegations of sexual assault. “The duke is no longer a financial burden on the King,” a source told the MailOnline. Andrew, who has seen his public standing plummet in recent years due to his friendship with the infamous sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, allegedly tried to call his older brother’s bluff in a failed attempt to keep the cash. A source told the Times in May: \"The King’s kindness is not without limit and there is a very good option for Andrew to move into Frogmore Cottage, recently vacated by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, which also has the benefit of being within the Windsor Castle security cordon hence reducing the need for alternative round-the-clock security for Royal Lodge. \"He is taking longer than desirable to recognise the reality of the situation, even though it is clearly the most sensible course of action. \"If he doesn’t agree to move to a property better suited to his needs, then the King may have to reconsider the levels of support he is willing to provide.” In January, reports suggested Andrew would have to fund the multi-million-pound security costs at Royal Lodge himself if he wanted to stay in Royal Lodge. Pressure has mounted on Andrew following the unsealing of hundreds of pages of court documents connected to the Jeffrey Epstein scandal. The legal papers detailed how Epstein's former housekeeper Juan Alessi claimed the duke had daily massages when he spent \"weeks\" at the paedophile financier's Florida home. Juan Alessi, who worked at Epstein's Palm Beach residence, said the duke and his ex-wife Sarah, Duchess of York, were friends with Epstein and the now-convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell. Previous allegations Andrew sexually assaulted Virginia Giuffre three times when she was 17 including during an orgy resurfaced in the court documents. Andrew strenuously denies the claims and in 2022 paid millions to Ms Giuffre to settle a civil case out of court, saying he never met her.\n",

Juan Alessi, who worked at Epstein's Palm Beach residence, said the duke and his ex-wife Sarah, Duchess of York, were friends with Epstein and the now-convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell. Previous allegations Andrew sexually assaulted Virginia Giuffre three times when she was 17 including during an orgy resurfaced in the court documents. Andrew strenuously denies the claims and in 2022 paid millions to Ms Giuffre to settle a civil case out of court, saying he never met her.\n",

      "King Charles' lifelong friend and renowned huntsman Ian Farquhar died after becoming trapped between his bed and a wall while drunk, an inquest has heard.\n",
      "Mr Farquhar died at the age of 78 at the King's Highgrove estate in Gloucestershire on March 6 of this year. The inquest heard that Mr Farquhar, who was not only a huntsman but the Queen Mother's equerry, was found with his legs in the air above his head behind a bedside table. The royal companion, who had previously served in the Queen's Own Hussars - a cavalry regiment of the British Army, is said to have developed a drinking problem in later years. Speaking at the inquest at Salisbury Coroner's Court, his daughter Victoria said: “He would drink a litre of gin and a couple of bottles of wine in a day.” The coroner heard how Farquhar’s blood alcohol level was 4.5 times over the drink-drive limit at the time of his death. A bottle of gin, two empty wine bottles and a half-empty bottle of whisky were also discovered at the country property.  The inquest heard how on March 6, care worker Beth Gillingham arrived at his home near Chippenham, Wiltshire, to find Mr Farquhar unresponsive. During her daily visit, the coroner heard how Ms Gillingham went upstairs when the guest did not respond to her calls. She recounted how she did not spot Mr Farquar until she peered down the side of the bed and saw him wedged against the wall. Upon finding no pulse, she described how she immediately called the police, with officers pronouncing him dead just after 1pm.

He was married to Pammie-Jane Chafer and had three daughters, one of which - Rose Farquhar - briefly dated Prince William in 2000. He's a character described by Camilla's ex-husband, Andrew Parker Bowles as “wild as a hawk in his youth, but always great fun”. Leading tributes to Mr Farquhar, Mr Bowles said he had been in poor health in recent months. He told the Mail that his friend was \"wild as a hawk in his youth, but always great fun\". He added that Mr Farquhar, who was known as 'The Captain', will be \"judged by history as one of the great Master of Hounds\". Mr Farquhar was Master of the Beaufort Hunt for over 30 years. Paying tribute on Instagram, the hunt said: \"It is with broken hearts we send our love and condolences to the family and friends of our own Captain Ian Farquhar, who so brilliantly piloted us for 34 years and passed away peacefully this week. \"‘Captain’ as he was known by many was loved and cherished by the entire hunting community, as someone who was supportive, kind and always there with excellent forward thinking advice for anyone who asked him. \"He had a wicked sense of humour and anyone who was lucky enough to be in his company and listen to tales of his extremely varied and adventurous life both in the army and the hunting world will hold onto those memories forever. \"Captain’s passions in life were hounds, his family and dogs - of which we know there’ll be a whole pack waiting for him up there thrilled to be in his company again. \"A true countryman and a true gent - he will be hugely missed.\"\n",

      "King Charles has submitted plans to hold weddings at Balmoral, the royal family's Scottish residence.\n",
      "The King wants to convert the Queen's building, which is close to the main castle, into a wedding venue. Charles has applied to the local council for permission to hold “weddings, dinners, meetings and other events” there. Rules for holding weddings in Scotland are more lax than in the rest of the UK. Venues do not need a licence, which is provided by the officiant themselves. Charles has increasingly opened up Balmoral to visitors since coming to the throne two years ago. The castle, acquired by the royal family in the mid-19th century, costs around £3 million to run each year - a third of which goes on wages. Read more: Queen's family persuaded her to spend final days at Balmoral, despite monarch's fears dying there was 'more difficult' Read more: King Charles to open up Balmoral Castle to public for first time Some 75,000 people help offset that each year by visiting the castle, paying a total of around £500,000 them for tickets. This summer, an extra tour went on sale to show visitors through the heart of the castle, with tickets selling for £100 a head. Those who wanted afternoon tea paid an extra £50. Despite the high price of a ticket, the tour sold out within 24 hours. A further tour has also gone on sale for November and December, including a seven-course locally-sourced meal with wine pairings, for £250. Charles was given permission last year to extend and make alterations to the Queen's building, originally built in the 1980s. The building is currently used largely as a function room for staff - but the new plans submitted will increase capacity from 250 to 277 on the inside and from 40 to 144 on the outside. The Queen’s building part of the premises may be used for \"weddings, dinners, meetings and associated events,\" the planning application to Aberdeenshire Council reads. \"These events may involve live performances and dancing where alcohol may be sold up to 12.30am,\" Charles' team adds. The application says that no one would be disturbed by any music playing at the wedding, given Balmoral's remoteness. It also says that the music will be kept at a \"low level\". Staff will be \"trained and supervised to ensure that no alcohol will be sold to children or young persons”. The royals have owned Balmoral for 176 years, after Queen Victoria bought the lease for the 50,000 acre estate. The castle was rebuilt by 1855. Balmoral was thought to be the favourite residence of Queen Elizabeth II, and she died there in 2022.\n",

Ms Thorpe, who has Aboriginal Australian heritage, said: \"You are not our King, you are not Sovereign... you have committed genocide against our people. \"Give us our land back. Give us what you stole from us... Our babies, Our people. You destroyed our land.\" She continued: \"Give us a treaty - we want a treaty with this country...

Protests continued throughout Charles’ stay down under, with a statue of Queen Victoria doused in red paint during his visit to Sydney. A spokesman for New South Wales Police said: “About 5.30am today [Oct 22], police were called to Queen Victoria Building, Market Street, Sydney CBD, following reports a statue had been vandalised. “Officers attached to Sydney City Police Area Command have established a crime scene and an investigation has commenced. “As inquiries continue, anyone with information about this incident is urged to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.”\n",

      "King Charles has shared his \"great joy\" at being back in Australia as he greeted cheering crowds.\n",
      "The King and Camilla met members of the public to kick off their first full day of their Australian tour.  The royals attended a church service in north Sydney before Charles went on to deliver a speech at the New South Wales parliament. He joked about the passing \"sands of time\" after presenting an hourglass he dubbed a \"speech timer\" to an Australian assembly to mark the 200th anniversary of its upper house.  \t Read more: King Charles and Camilla touch down in Australia for first overseas tour since becoming monarch Read more: King Charles to be snubbed by senior Australian politicians in major overseas trip The King, who attended commemorations marking the 150th anniversary of the Legislative Council in 1974, said in a speech to guests: \"Democratic systems must evolve, of course, to remain fit for purpose, but they are, nevertheless, essentially sound systems, as I said in this building 50 years ago.  \t \"When underpinned by wisdom and good faith, democracy has, I believe, an extraordinary capacity for innovation, compromise and adaptability, as well as stability.  \t \"Moreover, strong parliamentary systems, like the one we celebrate on this special occasion, are fundamental to the democracies that serve today's diverse societies; and are even more vital, given the ever-changing natural, social, economic and technological environment.\" Charles made the guests laugh with a quip about time: \"With the sands of time encouraging brevity, it just remains for me to say what a great joy it is to come to Australia for the first time as Sovereign, and to renew a love of this country and its people which I have cherished for so long.\"  \t The tour marks Charles' first major foreign trip since being diagnosed with cancer. Before he and Camilla joined the churchgoers at St Thomas' Anglican Church, its Rector Michael Mantle made them laugh when he told them: \"Jesus said you will not know the day nor the hour when the King will come.\"  \t When the couple first arrived they met some of the younger members of the congregation at the church door as a group of protesters could be heard shouting \"not my King\" but were drowned out by shouts of \"hip hip hooray\".   The Rector's wife, Ellie Mantle, had ushered the children out to meet the royals and brought a rugby ball, cricket ball and stuffed koala, gifts for the King's grandchildren Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis.  \t She said: \"It's a great honour for us as it's the first opportunity for the public to see the King and Queen.\"  \t After the service the royal couple went outside the church to shake hands with the well-wishers, who numbered around two hundred people, with some waiting since 5am to catch a glimpse of the royals.\n",

      "The King and Queen have arrived in Sydney for the start of their historic visit to Australia. Charles and Camilla were greeted by Australia's governor-general Sam Mostyn, the King's representative, and prime minister Anthony Albanese and his partner Jodie Haydon. As the royal couple landed on the tarmac, photos of the pair on past trips to the country were projected onto the exterior of the iconic Sydney Opera House.

The King and Queen posted a message on social media before their arrival in Australia for a tour, praising the country and its people. Charles and Camilla said on X, formerly Twitter: \"Ahead of our first visit to Australia as King and Queen, we are really looking forward to returning to this beautiful country to celebrate the extraordinarily rich cultures and communities that make it so special. See you there! The six-day trip to Canberra and Sydney is Charles' first to a commonwealth country since he became King following the death of Queen Elizabeth II. The King and Queen will also travel to Samoa for a three-day state visit and meet world leaders taking part in a Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting which Charles will formally open. The historical nature of the trip is underlined by the fact that this is the first trip King Charles has taken since his cancer diagnosis in February. He will be pausing cancer treatments for the tour and dropped a visit to New Zealand from the already streamlined itinerary on advice from doctors. LBC News reporter Will Chalk said it's impossible to \"overstate\" the importance that the King's cancer diagnosis plays in this trip. He said: \"You can't really overstate this part of the trip- a 75-year-old dealing with a cancer diagnosis, traveling for a working week on the other side of the world.\" The tour has attracted some controversy in Australia, stirring up debate over Australia's status as a Commonwealth country.  King Charles and Queen Camilla will not meet any State Premiers during their tour of Australia - in a snub by the key member of the Commonwealth. It comes after The King told anti-monarchists he will not intervene if a vote is held to remove him as head of state. Republican campaigners are calling it his \"Farewell Oz\" tour - amid ongoing calls for a referendum about Australia severing its ties with the monarchy.

      "Alex Salmond's 'final words' have been revealed after the Scottish “political colossus” died suddenly, aged 69.\n",
      "\n",
      "The former Scottish National Party leader signed off his final post with \"Scotland is a country not a county\" ahead of his sudden passing on Saturday. The comments, published to X a matter of hours before his death, saw Salmond fittingly  \"Tony Blair used to whine that he never really compared the Scottish Parliament to an “English Parish Council”, it was only the nasty Scottish press who twisted his remarks! In fact, he did so compare,\" he said. \"Part of becoming independent is about thinking independently, not subserviently. John should have politely declined the meeting with the words 'Scotland is a country not a county'.\" Salmond, who served as First Minister of Scotland from 2007 to 2014, passed away following a speech at an event in North Macedonia. The former party leader died after suffering a suspected \"heart attack\". It comes as Scotland's First Minister John Swinney paid tribute to a \"very significant player\" as he spoke with Lewis Goodall on Sunday.  The leader had fiercely campaigned for devolution over the course of 25 years, finally securing a referendum for Scottish independence in 2014 under Tory Prime Minister David Cameron. Salmond is credited with bringing the fight for Scottish independence to the mainstream of British politics, with the SNP describing him as a \"titan\" of their movement. The former SNP leader led the “Yes Scotland” campaign, championing Scottish independence in the lead-up to the 2014 referendum. Read more: Alex Salmond achieved the impossible, British politics will miss him and I will miss my friend He resigned as a result of the nation's decision to reject independence, later founding the new, pro-independence, Alba Party in 2021. King Charles and Queen Camilla were among the leaders who paid tribute to Salmond following the news, saying: \"My wife and I are greatly saddened to hear of the sudden death of Alex Salmond. \"His devotion to Scotland drove his decades of public service. \"We extend our deep condolences to his family and loved ones at this time.\" Former SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon also paid tribute to her \"mentor\" noting he was a \"significant figure\" in her life. Born in Linlithgow in 1954, Alexander Elliot Anderson Salmond was educated at Linlithgow Academy and St Andrew's University, where he first joined the SNP. Graduating with a degree in economics and history, he worked as an economist for both the Government Economic Service and the Royal Bank of Scotland before being elected as an MP for the Banff and Buchan constituency in 1987. His election at Westminster followed a turbulent period for the SNP, which saw its number of seats fall from 11 to two in the 1979 general election. He characterised his early time at Westminster as \"a one-man campaign of parliamentary disruption\" - best illustrated when he was ejected from the chamber during the 1988 budget. As a young and brash newcomer, Mr Salmond played a role in the breakaway faction of the party known as the \"79 Group\" which sought to take a more left-wing stance. His brief expulsion as a result did not hinder his advancement within the party in the long term, with his election to leader coming in 1990. With the creation of the Scottish Parliament in 1999, he went on to serve as leader of the opposition at Holyrood, while retaining his seat at Westminster. In the wake of the Scottish independence referendum, Salmond had a very public fallout with his friend and successor Nicola Sturgeon, over her government’s mishandling of sexual harassment claims against him. He was later acquitted of serious sexual assault charges in 2020. Outside of politics, Salmond had a number of roles in the media, including a radio show on LBC. LBC's Iain Dale described Salmond as a \"titan\" as he looked back on his time in UK politics as well as his career in radio with LBC. Following the news of his death, his political ally turned bitter rival Nicola Sturgeon praised his contributions to Scottish nationalism, but said she could not forget what led them to turn on each other. Her statement read: \"I am shocked and sorry to learn of Alex Salmond’s death. \"Obviously, I cannot pretend that the events of the past few years which led to the breakdown of our relationship did not happen, and it would not be right for me to try. \"However, it remains the fact that for many years Alex was an incredibly significant figure in my life. He was my mentor, and for more than a decade we formed one of the most successful partnerships in UK politics. \"Alex modernised the SNP and led us into government for the first time, becoming Scotland's fourth first minister and paving the way for the 2014 referendum which took Scotland to the brink of independence. He will be remembered for all of that. My thoughts are with Moira, his wider family and his friends.\" Tributes from all sides of the political aisle have poured in following his death. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer described him as a “monumental figure” of British politics. The Prime Minister said: \"For more than 30 years, Alex Salmond was a monumental figure of Scottish and UK politics. He leaves behind a lasting legacy. \"As First Minister of Scotland he cared deeply about Scotland's heritage, history and culture, as well as the communities he represented as MP and MSP over many years of service. \"My thoughts are with those who knew him, his family and his loved ones. On behalf of the UK government, I offer them our condolences today.\" Scotland's First Minister John Swinney said: \"I am deeply shocked and saddened at the untimely death of the former first minister Alex Salmond, and I extend my deepest condolences to Alex's wife Moira and to his family. \"Over many years, Alex made an enormous contribution to political life - not just within Scotland, but across the UK and beyond. \"Alex worked tirelessly and fought fearlessly for the country that he loved and for her independence. He took the Scottish National Party from the fringes of Scottish politics into government and led Scotland so close to becoming an independent country. \"There will be much more opportunity to reflect in the coming days, but today all of our thoughts are with Alex's family and his many friends right across the political spectrum.\"Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said Mr Salmond was \"a central figure in politics for over three decades\". In a statement, Mr Sarwar said: \"The sad news of Alex Salmond's passing today will come as a shock to all who knew him in Scotland, across the UK and beyond. \"Our thoughts are with his family and friends at this difficult time and on behalf of Scottish Labour I offer our sincere condolences to all who will be mourning his loss. \"Alex was a central figure in politics for over three decades and his contribution to the Scottish political landscape can not be overstated.\" Former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak added: \"Alex Salmond was a huge figure in our politics. \"While I disagreed with him on the constitutional question, there was no denying his skill in debate or his passion for politics. May he rest in peace.\" Scottish Conservative leader Russell Findlay said: \"I am shocked and saddened to hear of Alex Salmond's sudden passing. \"No matter our political beliefs, we can all respect his dedication to public service as an MSP, MP and First Minister of Scotland. \"He will be remembered as a formidable and impressive politician who made a lasting impact on our country. \"The thoughts of everyone in the Scottish Conservative Party are with his family and friends.\" Douglas Ross, former leader of the Scottish Conservatives, wrote on X: \"Alex Salmond made a huge impact in the North East and across the whole country. \"While we had opposing political views, he was a towering figure in Scottish politics which he dominated for many years. \"My thoughts are with Moira and his family and friends at this difficult time.\" Reform UK leader Nigel Farage described him as “a very engaging figure who could talk to anyone” and said “he made Scottish nationalism a force.” While former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn wrote: “Very sad to hear of Alex Salmond’s passing. “He was formidable, determined and principled to his core. “We will miss his tenacity and humour most. My thoughts are with his family and friends in Scotland and around the world.”\n",

The Australian Republic Movement (ARM) wrote to Buckingham Palace to request a meeting with him when he arrives. In response, his assistant private secretary said the monarch had \"deep love and affection\" for Australia. He commended the group's \"thoughtfulness\" at writing, adding that it was \"warmly appreciated\".

But in their letter, they said it was time for their country to stand \"on an equal footing with other nations\". The group said there was mounting support for the move. It comes after Charles' representative in Australia, Governor General Sam Mostyn, recently said he had a \"huge regard\" for Australia. \"He wants to see modern Australia, engage with communities broadly though within a tight time frame, given his health,\" she said. A referendum on the issue was last held in 1999 - with almost 55 per cent voting no to axing the monarchy. In January, the Australian government said it had put any plans for a new vote on hold, claiming it is \"not a priority\".\n",

      "King Charles is set to miss the COP29 climate summit as he continues his cancer treatment.\n",
      "Charles is expected to miss the event in Azerbaijan next month as he continues to pace himself while undergoing cancer treatment. The monarch is well known as an environmentalist, with organisers of the conference having hoped he would be able to attend. At the previous summit, he said the world remains \"dreadfully far off track\" when it comes to meeting climate targets. But the government is understood to have chosen not to ask him to represent the country this year. Sources said that No10 felt \"an abundance of caution\" was needed with the monarch's current schedule.

Other members of the royal family have stepped up over the last year as the King and Princess Kate have received cancer treatment.  Prince William has followed in his father's footsteps when it comes to his love for the natural world. In a video address at the UN General Assembly last month, William spoke of the \"grave threat\" the planet is facing. He also announced finalists of the annual Earthshot Prize awards. Despite Charles not attending the summit this year, doctor are understood to have allowed him to \"pause\" his cancer treatment to fly to Australia for a royal visit next week. He is expected to continued his treatment cycle as soon as he returns to the UK.\n",

      "The Duke of Sussex is celebrating the achievements and resilience of seriously ill youngsters and their families during his brief UK visit. Harry is WellChild's patron, a position he has held for more than 15 years. The visit will raise speculation about whether Harry and his estranged brother the Prince of Wales will see each other, or if the duke will make a trip to Scotland to spend time with his father the King. But it remains unlikely that William and Harry will make contact after the pair reportedly did not talk when they attended a family funeral in August in the UK. Read More: King Charles and Queen Camilla visit Holyrood to mark 25 years of Scottish Parliament Read More: Prince Harry to honour seriously ill children and families in UK charity visit - but unlikely to reunite with family The King, meanwhile, is believed to be spending time at Balmoral. It is thought that Charles has not seen Harry since the duke rushed to his father's side after his cancer diagnosis was announced in February. During Harry's visit to the WellChild awards, he chatted with Noah Nicholson, 6, who at one point threw his cuddly toys at the prince. Harry quickly noticed that one toy was a small giraffe named \"Raffy.\"  He said: \"Is this the same one? No way! Every parent has a spare. I've got at least six spares. \"My daughter Lili has these Lovies.\" The WellChild awards this evening celebrated the seriously ill young people and the dedication of those who care for them, including health, social care and education professionals. Harry regularly attends the annual event hosted by WellChild, the national charity which provides a nationwide network of nurses, home makeover projects and family support programmes. Before the big event the duke is attending a reception to meet the category winners and their families before joining guests for the private awards ceremony. He will later present the Most Inspirational Child (aged four to six) award and deliver a short speech. In past years Harry has been joined by wife Meghan but travelled alone to London from their home in the celebrity enclave of Montecito in California where the couple established a new life for themselves and their children Archie, five, and Lilibet, three. Speaking ahead of the ceremony, WellChild chief executive Matt James said Harry's involvement with the charity was \"huge for us\". He added: \"It does two things, it allows us to give our inspiring winners a night they will never forget, a night that will always stay with them. \"But also, it provides us with a platform to tell their stories which is really important for a group of families whose challenges often go unrecognised and misunderstood.\"\n",

      "The former PM and deputy PM are said to be on resignation watch to quit the Commons by the end of the year, after the Tory leadership race concludes on November 2. And the former defence secretary is eying up Mr Dowden’s seat in Parliament if he goes, multiple sources have told LBC. When grilled by LBC last night, Mr Shapps, who lost his Welwyn Hatfield seat narrowly in July, refused to rule it out.

If you ask has the itch been eradicated, no, I really enjoy public service, it is something I may come back to in future. When asked about rumours the former PM or his deputy could quit, he added: “All I’d say is, I’m in no rush, I’ve been very happy to adjust to spend a bit. More time doing the things I love. I’m in no rush and I’m not thinking about any of that at the moment.” Sources close to the former PM dismissed suggestions that he was poised to quit, describing the claims as “ridiculous”. And a source close to Mr Dowden described the suggestion as “b*****t”. Mr Shapps also told LBC that Israel has the right 'not be fired at' by Hezbollah in defence of incursion into Lebanon He said: “Israel is in a terrible situation, they have got rockets being fires by Hezbollah on a daily basis, it doesn’t get reported in our news. What is this tiny, small democracy, the size of Wales, supposed to do? Just allow these rockets to continually fire at them with no action? They’ve been suffering this for a very long time. Hezbollah haven’t complied with the UN resolution 1701 to pull back from the border. I hope this can be over, I support the calls for a ceasefire, but a ceasefire has to work in both directions, the rockets can’t continue.  “I understand their right not to be fired on all day long by a bunch of terrorists. Hezbollah are recognised by Britain as a bunch of terrorists.”\n",

Dozens of migrants entered the water at Gravelines and pulled themselves onto an already packed boat.  It comes as the latest figures show there had been a record number of crossings for the first seven months of a calendar year.  \t According to the Home Office, 255 migrants made the journey on Sunday, taking the provisional total for the year so far to 16,457.  \t The previous record for arrivals in the seven months from January to July was 16,420 in 2022, with 14,732 making the journey in the same period last year.  \t Men, women and young children, some wearing life jackets, could be seen appearing from sand dunes and walking across the beach.  \t Some youngsters were carried on shoulders, but families turned back from the sea as others walked out into the water to be picked up by the inflatable boat.  \t Police patrolled the beach and appeared to approach families before they turned away.  \t In the Commons, Reform UK's Ashfield MP Lee Anderson accused France of being \"complicit\" in migrant Channel crossings in light of the latest activity, asking Yvette Cooper: \"Does the Home Secretary agree with me it's time now to stop paying the French any more money until they stop being complicit in this evil trade?\"  \t Read More: People smugglers jailed after cramming migrants under campervan bed, on same day as foreign criminals deported Read More: Keir Starmer vows to tackle migrant crisis 'at source' as he announces £84 million in aid for Africa and Middle East Ms Cooper said the crossings were \"extremely dangerous\" as she mentioned the latest death, adding: \"Criminal gangs are deliberately cramming boats to maximise their profits, and they have been getting away with it for far too long.  \t \"That is why we need a new border security command in place, but it is also why we need to work not simply with the French police but also with police forces and organisations right across Europe, and beyond, in order to pursue the gangs and to prevent the boats reaching the French coast in the first place\", she said.  \t Last year, 29,437 migrants made the journey to the UK, down 36% on a record 45,774 arrivals in 2022.  \t Monthly data comes from the most recent Home Office quarterly update on irregular migration to the UK, which presents the \"final and authoritative statistics on small boat arrivals\".\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I wholeheartedly agree,\" is not usually a phrase which gets bandied about too much, neither is \"I can assure him that the opposition will support him\". But this was a different occasion for the PM's first outing, where both sides focused on areas of agreement, rather than difference.  Full to the rafters with Labour MPs forced to crane their necks to see into the chamber due to their sheer numbers, the usual roar greeted Sir Keir as he sat down to see his huge majority laid out before him for the first time. On the Labour benches there were bright smiles and even brighter coloured outfits, and a warm sense of occasion for these keen, bright young things. Read more: Starmer says crisis in public finances 'more severe than we first thought' in first PMQs since entering No10 Read more: Keir Starmer suspends seven rebel Labour MPs who voted to get rid of two-child benefit cap And the Commons chamber had a spirit of unity and calm, collegiate, collaboration in it for the first time in many weeks. Sunak, with the weight of the world now firmly off his shoulders, broke the ice from the start with a gentle rinsing of his own. He wished Team GB good luck in the Olympics, though admitted: \"I am probably not the first person they want to hear advice from on how to win.\" A ripple of laughter echoed around the room. This was not a man about to go in for the fight. The former PM chose not to go in for the kill - he will leave that scrapping now to his own side as they battle it out to wear his crown. Instead he chose to spend his questions pressing the PM on serious, statesmanlike issues of which there was broad cross party support built, and which was in the spirit of this new, \"serious\" PM, to straight bat back. The emergency Jeremy Corbyn button didn't need to be pressed, nor an insult about Liz Truss' economic record.  Ukraine and national security dominated the session, without the sparring, jibes and insults that are usually peppered between barbs. Both sides praised the other's leadership and commitment to Ukraine, to long-range missiles, to financial aid, and to the support of NATO and other global alliances. If Starmer was confused at having swapped over to the Government green benches on the opposite side, he didn't seem it. It did appear a bit harder, however, for Rishi Sunak to say the words \"'prime minister\". Even the biggest government rebellion over a King's Speech since the 1950s couldn't halt Starmer's stride. The PM might not regret suspending a crop of his most problematic and embarrassing MPs this week, but whether the new awkward squad cause him problems in future is a question of when, not if. Despite a few tricky questions on trans puberty blockers, a ceasefire in Gaza, and the two child benefit cap, the new PM emerged unscathed and in a position of strength as he marks nearly three weeks in power. No winners, because there aren't any when one of them refuses to even go into battle at all. This interim leader is already out.\n",

      "Rishi Sunak will serve as acting leader of the Conservative Party until November, allowing the Tories nearly four months to find  a successor. \n",
      "While Mr Sunak has formally resigned as Tory Party leader, he will temporarily remain as Leader of the Opposition until a replacement is selected on November 2.  Those wishing to join the race to replace the former Prime Minister will need to secure the backing of a proposer, a seconder, and eight nominations in order to make it onto the ballot.  Priti Patel, the former Home Secretary, will run to be the next Tory leader, according to The Telegraph. Other Tories who are considering leadership bids include the former Foreign Secretary, James Cleverly, and the Shadow Security Minister, Tom Tugendhat.  Kemi Badenoch, the former Business Secretary, is the bookies' favourite to be the next Tory leader.  Earlier today, the former Work and Pensions Secretary, Mel Stride, also said he was considering throwing his hat into the ring.  He told LBC's Nick Ferrari: “There's been a lot of speculation, the reality is it is something I am considering, it's something colleagues are discussing with me.” Nominations will open at 7pm on Wednesday, closing at 2.30pm on Monday, July 29.  Tory MPs will then narrow the race down to four MPs, who will have until Conservative Party Conference - likely to be in October - to make their case.  Once conference is over, MPs will then whittle the race down to two candidates. Tory Party members will then select the next leader in a head-to-head vote.  Read More: Who is left to lead the Tory party? Badenoch and Braverman among favourites to become new leader Read More: Planning reform blitz, ban on zero-hour contracts and Sunak’s smoking bill revived: the King’s Speech in brief Mr Sunak resigned as Prime Minister and announced his intention to step down as Tory leader after leading his party to its worst-ever election result.  The party, which won 365 seats in 2019, was left with just 121 MPs following the recent General Election.  There had been rumours Mr Sunak would quit before the end of summer, but he has agreed to stay on.  Mr Sunak said: “It’s in the national interest for us to have a smooth and orderly transition to a new Leader of the Opposition so I will stay in post until November 2nd, and the result of our leadership election.   “This will allow our party to fulfil its role as the official opposition professionally and effectively. I believe this is what is best for the Conservative Party and, most importantly, our country.     “It would be inappropriate for me to make any comment about the leadership campaign or candidates. I am confident that this timetable decided by the Party Board and the 1922 Committee will allow for a thoughtful, professional and respectful contest.”    Bob Blackman MP, Chairman of the 1922 Committee, added: “Following discussions between the Party Board and the 1922 executive, the timetable for the election of a new leader of the Conservative Party has been agreed.     “Over August, candidates will be able to engage with the voluntary party before in September, the parliamentary party selects 4 candidates to go to conference.   “The parliamentary party will then pick the 2 candidates who go forward to the members ballot with the new leader elected on the 2nd of November.   “I am determined that our party will have a respectful and thorough leadership debate. I believe that this timetable will allow for this.     “While there are significant debates to be had about our party’s future, we must remember that the country—and our members—want to see us engaged in proper debate not personal attacks.    “I am confident that this process will allow for this. I am delighted that Rishi Sunak will remain in post until the 2nd of November and the election of a new leader. This will allow for a smooth and orderly process.”   Richard Fuller MP, Chairman of the Conservative Party, said: “This process has party members at its heart.    “I very much welcome Rishi Sunak’s decision to remain as leader until the election of a new leader thereby enabling this full engagement of candidates with members.     “Party conference will be a great opportunity for our hard working volunteers to meet the leading candidates and make their views known to MPs before the final two candidates are put to a final vote by Party members.   “Party members will be the voice of this leadership campaign.”\n",

      "Rishi Sunak ‘trashing my record’ is to blame for the Conservatives' disastrous election result, the former Prime Minister Liz Truss has claimed. \n",
      "Writing in The Telegraph, Ms Truss admitted she stayed quiet during the election campaign “to prevent further damage to the party” but said she must “speak out now”. The former Prime Minister said: “More than 250 of us paid the electoral price for this. Regrettably, over the course of the next five years it will be the British people who have to bear the cost of this failing.” Ms Truss then singled out Mr Sunak, who she claims “abandoned” Conservatives principles by claiming that “cutting taxes did not generate growth”.  This morning, former Tory MP Conor Burns unleashed on Ms Truss following her comments, saying those around her are \"letting her down.  He told LBC's Sunday with Lewis Goodall: \"I don't think she's actually well and those who are close to her are letting her down by not telling her the truth, she is preposterous, she is toxic, she needs to be quiet!\" “This abandonment of Conservative principles not only led to him getting no credit from the voters for cutting National Insurance,” she continued. “But also led to an even larger general election defeat as he continued to trash my record and promote Labour’s false narrative that the global rise in mortgage rates was somehow my fault.”  Read More: ‘We did it’ says Starmer: Labour sweeps to power as senior Tories including Truss and Mogg ousted in election bloodbath Read More: Shellshocked Liz Truss motionless on stage as she loses to Labour by just 600 votes Ms Truss became the first former Prime Minister in nearly a century to lose their seat at last week's general election. Labour recorded the biggest swing in election history to take Ms Truss' seat in South West Norfolk by just 600 votes. Mr Sunak and Ms Truss went head-to-head in the Tory leadership contest in 2022, with the former Chancellor repeatedly claiming his opponent's tax-cutting agenda would not work.  Mr Sunak was vindicated in the end after Ms Truss' mini-budget crashed the pound and sent mortgages spiralling.  In the end, Ms Truss lasted just 49 days in office, and was replaced by Mr Sunak.  Mr Sunak is not the only former Prime Minister Ms Truss had in her sights, but also blamed Tony Blair.  The ex-MP claimed “the seeds of this defeat go right back to 1997 and the way that the Conservative Party responded to the New Labour project, both in opposition and in government”.  She added: “Rather than taking on the Leftist agenda, far too often it was bought into – and the election result was our punishment for having done so.” In total, the Conservatives were reduced to just 121 seats in last week's General Election, with Labour storming to victory in old Tory heartlands, including Norfolk.\n",

      "Rishi Sunak has officially stepped down as Prime Minister after a catastrophic election that saw the Tories slump to their lowest ever number of MPs.\n",
      "The ex-PM flew back to London from Yorkshire where he conceded. He delivered a statement at Downing Street today where he said 'I'm sorry.' Mr Sunak told the nation today in his resignation speech: “I am sorry.  “I have given this job my all but you have sent a clear signal that the government of the United Kingdom must change.  “I have heard your anger. Following this result I will step down as party leader, not immediately , but once the formal arrangements for selecting my successor are in place.” He said Sir Keir Starmer is a \"decent, public spirited man, who I respect.\" Mr Sunak and his wife and his wife Akshata Murty were then driven to meet with King Charles at Buckingham Palace where the outgoing Tory leader formally gave his resignation to the monarch. The couple were greeted at the King's door by Sir Clive Alderton, principal private secretary to the King and Queen, and the King's equerry Commander William Thornton, Royal Navy.  \t He is expected to leave privately and unseen with his family after the audience with the King. A statement from Buckingham Palace said: \"The Right Honourable Rishi Sunak MP had an audience of The King this morning and tendered his resignation as Prime Minister and First Lord of the Treasury, which His Majesty was graciously pleased to accept.\" Mr Sunak now faces the prospect of trying to rally the Conservative Party with a leadership contest widely expected in the coming weeks or months. Mr Sunak shouldered the burden for a \"sobering verdict\" at the election, as competing Tory factions began their battle over the diminished party's future. The outgoing Prime Minister said it had been a \"difficult night\" and apologised to Conservative candidates who had lost their seats, as he held onto his own Richmond and Northallerton constituency. General Election LIVE - Britain Decides: Labour landslide wipes out Tories as Liz Truss loses seat Shellshocked Liz Truss motionless on stage as she loses to Labour by just 600 votes Andrew Marr: Voters gave Labour a blank cheque but they have to deliver otherwise the backlash will be ferocious Mr Sunak's apology was echoed by Suella Braverman, but the Tory leadership challenger was sorry for her party's record in Government, suggesting it had not listened enough to the electorate. Elsewhere, Liz Truss lost her Norfolk South West seat, which she won with a thumping 26,200 majority in 2019, to Labour. The former prime minister, who during her short time in Downing Street oversaw the disastrous mini-budget that spooked markets, said the Tories had not \"delivered sufficiently\" on voters' priorities including curbing immigration. Ms Truss declined to give a concession speech. Meanwhile, former justice Sir Robert Buckland warned that a lurch to the right would be \"disastrous\" for the party after he lost his Swindon South seat. Speaking at Northallerton leisure centre after his result came in, Mr Sunak said: \"The British people have delivered a sobering verdict tonight, there is much to learn... and I take responsibility for the loss. \"To the many good, hard-working Conservative candidates who lost tonight, despite their tireless efforts, their local records and delivery, and their dedication to their communities. I am sorry.\" The Prime Minister held onto his seat with a nearly 13,000 majority over his nearest rival, Labour's Tom Wilson, but conceded defeat for the Tories amid crushing results elsewhere for the party. Among the Cabinet ministers to lose their seats overnight were Defence Secretary Grant Shapps and Commons Leader Penny Mordaunt to Labour, and Justice Secretary Alex Chalk, Education Secretary Gillian Keegan and Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer to the Liberal Democrats. Jeremy Hunt won the Godalming and Ash seat in Surrey despite a threat from the Liberal Democrats. The outgoing Chancellor said the Conservatives' \"crushing\" defeat was a \"bitter pill to swallow\" for the party. Former home secretary Ms Braverman was elected to the new constituency of Fareham and Waterlooville. She said \"I'm sorry\" twice during her victory speech. \"I'm sorry that my party didn't listen to you,\" she said. \"(The) Conservative Party has let you down. You - the Great British people voted for us over 14 years and we did not keep our promises. \"We've acted as if we're entitled to your vote regardless of what we did, regardless of what we didn't do, despite promising time after time that we would do those things and we need to learn our lesson because if we don't, bad as tonight has been for my party, we'll have many worse nights to come.\" Thanking voters in her constituency, Ms Braverman said they were \"patriotic, common sense, kindly, dedicated, enterprising\". Outgoing Home Secretary James Cleverly, who held his seat in Braintree, Essex, warned that \"there is nothing honourable in presenting simple and thin solutions to challenging and complex problems\". Mr Shapps, who lost his Welwyn Hatfield seat to Labour, said his party had an \"inability to iron out (its) differences\" amid and endless \"soap opera\". And in Portsmouth, outgoing Tory MP Ms Mordaunt said the Tories had lost because they \"failed to honour the trust that people had placed in it\". She added: \"Our renewal as a party and a country will not be achieved by us talking to an ever smaller slice of ourselves but being guided by the people of our country. And if we want again to be the natural party of government, then our values must be the people's.\" Seats previously held by Tory big beasts, including Boris Johnson's Uxbridge and South Ruislip and Theresa May's Maidenhead, were taken by Labour and the Liberal Democrats respectively. Tory Northern Ireland minister Steve Baker, who had signalled his intention to launch a Tory leadership bid after the election, said \"thank God I'm a free man\" after he was defeated by Labour in Wycombe. Business and trade minister Greg Hands lost Chelsea and Fulham to Labour.\n",

The Prime Minister has revealed that his family “have a bit of a tradition\" when it comes to their General Election diet. \"One of my local butchers called Kitson’s in Northallerton High Street, always do a special election pie”, Mr Sunak said.

But will the outgoing PM be able to stomach a slice of humble pie come Friday morning?  Yesterday brought about a long-delayed admission of defeat from the Prime Minister, tweeting: “Stop the supermajority. Vote Conservative on 4th July.”  So is this more of a last supper rather than a jolly Yorkshire tradition? Well, Kitsons are more optimistic than most. On whether this will be the last election pork pie the butcher will be making for Mr Sunak, Kitson's remain hopeful, saying: “No - he’s our constituency MP”.  The butcher does however concede that Mr Sunak may not be picking up the pie himself adding: “I think he’ll be a bit busy today”.

Mr Sunak's former home secretary said the party needs to “prepare for the reality and frustration of opposition”.  “The fight for the soul of the Conservative party will determine whether we allow Starmer a clear run at destroying our country for good, or have a chance to redeem it in due course,” Ms Braverman said on Tuesday.  “Indeed, it will decide whether our party continues to exist at all.”  In her article, Ms Braverman also blasted her party for keeping the money donated by Frank Hester, who said looking at Diane Abbott \"makes you want to shoot all black people\".  \"Reform demonstrably failed to vet its candidates properly and these people should be nowhere near public life. I’ve been on the receiving end of racism myself and it’s right that the PM called it out,\" she said.   \"But cries of hurt and anger look less powerful when the Conservative Party was perfectly happy to take the money from Frank Hester.  \"Remarks about hating black women were glossed over in the name of filling our party coffers.

It is understood Mr Sunak will resign immediately should the Tories slump to defeat in tomorrow's General Election.  Ms Braverman has been touted as a potential future leader of the Tory party, though is reportedly struggling to gather support among prospective MPs and candidates.  Other potential leadership candidates include Kemi Badenoch, who recently set up a ‘Kemi4leader’ website, and Penny Mordaunt, who ran after Boris Johnson quit in 2022.  Steve Baker, a prominent Brexiteer, has been more open about his ambitions, throwing his hat in the ring on Monday when he spoke to Sophy Ridge on Sky.  “We’ve reached a position where we know Labour are most likely to come into power,” Baker said. However, Baker is predicted to lose his seat, according to a number of polls. Badenoch and Mordaunt, who are running for re-election in North West Essex and Portsmouth North, have also been predicted to lose their seats in some polls. \n",

      "The Conservatives brought out their last-minute secret weapon on Tuesday evening as Boris Johnson reunited with Rishi Sunak. It came as part of a final push before Brits head to polling stations on Thursday for the general election. The former PM was greeted by cheers, claps, whistles and chants of \"Boris, Boris, Boris\" as he made his way on stage.

Sunak seizes on England's win to insist there is still hope for Tories In an immediate jibe at Labour, he thanked attendees for \"coming so late, way past Keir Starmer's bed time\".  \t \"When Rishi asked me to come and help of course I couldn't say no,\" he said.  \t \"We're all here because we love our country.\" Mr Johnson went on to warn that a Labour supermajority would see the country \"lurch in diametrically the wrong direction\". He said those considering instead voting for Reform should \"draw back from the brink\" to stop Sir Keir's \"sledgehammer majority\". A Labour government would increase taxes and would not stand up to Vladimir Putin, Mr Johnson suggested.  \t \"They will scrap the Rwanda plan,\" he said before describing Labour MPs as \"Kremlin crawlers\".  \t Mr Johnson led the Tories to victory in 2019 against Jeremy Corbyn's Labour. He told crowds: \"They can achieve nothing in this election except to usher in the most left-wing Labour government since the war with a huge majority, and we must not let it happen.  \t \"Don't let the Putinistas deliver the Corbynistas. Don't let Putin's pet parrots give this entire country psittacosis - which is a disease you get by the way from cosying up to pet parrots.  \t \"Friends, if you actually - everybody if you actually want higher taxes next week, this year, if you feel you've got a few thousands to spare, then vote Labour on Thursday.  \"If you want uncontrolled immigration and mandatory wokery, and pointless kowtowing to Brussels again, then go right ahead, make my day, vote for Starmer.  \t \"But if you want to protect our democracy and our economy and keep this country strong abroad by spending 2.5% of our GDP on defence which Labour still refuses to commit to, then you know what to do, don't you, everybody?  \t \"There's only one thing to do - vote Conservative on Thursday my friends and I know you will. I know you will.\" Following Mr Johnson on Tuesday evening, Mr Sunak hailed the \"Conservative family united\". He claimed just 130,000 voters could help stem his party's predicted losses. It came after Survation pollsters found Labour is on course to win more seats than it did in 1997. But Labour leader Sir Keir has brushed off claims his party is on for a landslide, saying: \"Every single vote has to be earned.\" He told campaigners: \"People are saying the polls predict the future - they don't predict the future, every single vote counts, every single vote has to be earned and in places like this it'll probably go down to a few hundred either way and therefore the worst thing for people who want change is to think 'job done' and 'we don't need to vote because there's going to be a majority in any event'.  \t \"It isn't 'job done'.\" The Tory rally was one of the final events before voting takes place on Thursday. Lib Dem deputy leader Daisy Cooper described Mr Johnson's appearance as \"a desperate new low\" for Mr Sunak's campaign.  \t \"This is an insult to everyone who made heart-breaking sacrifices during the pandemic,\" she said.  \t \"Rishi Sunak has reached a desperate new low, turning to a man who discredited the office of prime minister and lied to the country time after time.  \t \"It is time to boot out this tired and sleaze-ridden Conservative party, and elect Liberal Democrat MPs who will stand up for their communities.\"\n",

      "On Tuesday, the Prime Minister will insist that the election “is not a foregone conclusion”, despite dire polling which suggests his party could slump to their worst-ever defeat.  But Mr Sunak is warning that if just 130,000 people in marginal seats changed their minds, Sir Keir Starmer's Labour Party would be denied a \"supermajority\".  Mr Sunak's warnings derive from a YouGov poll, which suggested Labour's predicted 200-seat majority would fall away if those people switched their votes to the Tories. If that, a hung parliament is the likely outcome.   The term 'supermajority' is largely associated with the Government in America and relates to a specific proportion of votes in excess of a simple majority. For example, needing 60 per cent of the vote to win.  Critics have suggested the term has no relevance to the UK political system, as a party with a majority of 20 or 200 is just as powerful.  Nonetheless, the Prime Minister has continued to urge voters not to hand Sir Keir a \"blank cheque\" this Thursday.

If just 130,000 people switch their vote and lend us their support, we can deny Starmer that supermajority. “Just think about that: you have the power to use your vote to prevent an unchecked Labour government.” Mr Sunak will go on to say that a \"huge\" number of seats at the election will be decided by hundreds of votes.  He continued: “So, every vote we move will have an impact and make it more likely that your Conservative candidate is returned to Parliament so that they can be your voice, represent your values and stand up for you.”\n",

      "From rallies to stump speeches, business visits to warehouse tours, leaders of all colours are pounding as much pavement as they can before polling day on Thursday in a last-ditch attempt to swing as many votes as they can. In the final days, the polls still look stubborn for the PM, and are barely budging.  Yet, with up to a third of people still yet to decide, there’s still supposedly all to play for. And so, LBC boarded the Tory battle bus brigade to see up close what could be the final days of the PM’s time in office, or the beginnings of the most spectacular comeback British politics has ever seen. Rishi Sunak hoped it would be the latter when we donned our hi-vis jackets to sit down with him for a media huddle in Stoke On Trent at a pharmaceutical warehouse. In a bid to emulate England’s nail-biting comeback against Slovakia on Sunday, the PM insisted to laughs around the room: “It’s not over 'til it’s over!” As he batted back questions on the party’s fate, the rise of the far right across Europe and whether he could have done more to combat Reform, there was a quiet acceptance to his demeanour about the week ahead. He even had a small spring in his step as he bounded on the stage to warn voters they could be seeing 15 years of Starmer if they weren’t careful – and to think about what they wanted. With the remnants of Gamble Gate behind him and no slip-ups to note, by the end of the day the PM had a genuine smile on his face as he batted cricket balls back from a girls’ team in Nuneaton, which the polls say is on a knife edge. And that was before The Guardian nearly got whacked by a runaway ball. The tee-total PM was even grinning as he handed out gin and whisky minis to the travelling media pack - and joked to his staff whether they were getting on it. Gin expert Ollie gave the PM a glimmer of good news as predicted the Stratford seat wouldn’t swing to the Lib Dems, even as he admitted there was no alcohol-free version of the tipples for the Tory leader. But he admitted that despite pressing the flesh with the PM in Stratford, he’s still not sure where his own vote is going.Sunak found a bit more luck in the waverers outside of Warwick. One keen cricketer told me he’d never be voting for Keir Starmer, and his partner said she’d still not made up her mind yet. Wannabe Tory MPs hope that in the cold light of day, swing voters like these two will look at the choice facing them in the ballot box and decide it’s better the devil they know with the Tories. They at least hope the warnings over racist and misogynistic candidates and fears over Nigel Farage’s stance on Ukraine will stem the flow of votes to Reform. In many ways the current electorate – which just five years ago swung to give Boris Johnson a huge 80 seat majority – has never been more volatile. But those MPs privately know that there’s a high chance they could be out of office for good come the end of the week. After a long gruelling campaign, beginning in the pouring rain, dogged by gaffes, scandal and a gruelling schedule which has seen many tempers lost, there is now a sense of calm that is settling into the Tory camp. Not a feeling of giving up, but perhaps at peace with throwing everything they've got at the final few days ahead and trying to enjoy the bumpy ride ahead. For the PM it may be sweet relief that the end, is finally in sight.\n",

      "The Conservatives look set to be ‘all but wiped out’ in London following Thursday's General Election, new polling suggests. \n",
      "A new poll by Savanta puts Labour on 49 per cent of the vote in the capital, while the Tories sit in second place on a meagre 19 per cent.  Reform UK are in third place, with 11 per cent of the vote, followed by the Liberal Democrats on 10 per cent.  Savanta's political research director, Chris Hopkins, has said if the results are replicated on Thursday, the Tories could be \"wiped out\" from London.  The Tories currently have 20 London seats, though this is likely to drop even further should the poll be replicated in Thursday's results. “Their party is deeply unpopular in the capital, leaking votes to Reform UK and facing threats from both Labour and the Liberal Democrats,” Hopkins said.  “Labour is seen by Londoners as most trusted on every policy issue important to them, from housing to the cost of living.  “That ultimately will be likely what drives Londoners on polling day, with our research also suggesting they’re looking forward to a London Mayor and a national government working together.” Read More: Labour planning to ‘change democracy to permanently keep themselves in power’, James Cleverly claims Read More: 'It's not over till it's over!' Sunak seizes on England's win to insist there is still hope for Tories The new polling comes as the parties enter the final week of campaigning ahead of Thursday's poll.  Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives are continuing their method of warning about a Labour \"supermajority\", as some polls suggest they could be left with less 100 seats.  Speaking on LBC this morning, the Home Secretary claimed Labour are planning to \"change democracy\" to keep themselves \"permanently\" in power.  Asked by Nick Ferrari if the Tories had conceded defeat, Mr Cleverly said: “We’re still fighting for every vote.“But look, Nick, we see the opinion polls. It would be ridiculous for us to not warn about the implications of a Labour victory.” Mr Cleverly went on to say that a Labour victory is not an inevitability but issued a warning about Labour's plans to extend votes to 16-year-olds. Elsewhere, Keir Starmer has been speaking at a campaign rally in Hertfordshire as the General Election campaign reaches a climax.  Speaking alongside Labour candidate Alistair Strathern, the Labour leader urged voters to “turn the page and start rebuilding our country”. “All of that comes to an end if Labour form a government and we return politics to service,” the Labour leader continued.  “Then we get on with our first steps, sleeves rolled up, getting on with those first steps, those extra appointments in our NHS, those extra teachers that we need in our schools, those extra police officers that we need.  “We get on with that straight away but the mindset changes, and we bring the country together.”\n",

      "Former Chancellor Jeremy Hunt told LBC that Starmer shouldn't sack Rachel Reeves, although her budget 'was a disaster'.\n",
      "Former Tory Chancellor Jeremy Hunt told LBC's Andrew Marr that Sir Keir Starmer shouldn't sack Rachel Reeves, but called for a new budget in March after a 'disaster' budget last year. Mr Hunt said sacking Ms Reeves as Chancellor \"wouldn't be the right thing for the country now,\" though mistakes have been made by the Labour government. He told Andrew Marr: \"I do think some of these problems have been made in Downing Street, the Budget was a disaster. \"But in the end what we really need is for the right decisions to be taken. We could still have that better Budget this year\". It comes as Ms Reeves continues to face pressure amid market turmoil, as the pound plunged in value, the lowest against the dollar since November, while concerns over increased government borrowing mount. On Monday, Keir Starmer appeared to waver in his support for The embattled Chancellor when he said he had confidence in her but refused to say she would keep her role until the next general election.

Mr Hunt was also asked about the recent tensions surrounding the ceasefire deal agreed between Israel and Hamas, saying it would be 'absolutely tragic' if the deal fell through. The Israeli cabinet has delayed their vote on the deal, which was supposed to take place today, as pressure from inside Netanyahu's cabinet mounts both from those in favour, but particularly from the far-right members who are against it. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu has claimed that Hamas is reneging on the Gaza ceasefire deal and causing a ‘last-minute crisis,' an accusation the group denies. Mr Hunt said: \"The whole world, including the whole American political spectrum from left to right, is hoping we get a deal over the line. All eyes are on the Prime Minister of Israel. \"He's a hardliner, and hardliners are often curiously people who can these deals over the line...I think we are just hoping we do get that vote through later today... \"I think this agreement is a good one, it's the only game in town, and I think it would be absolutely tragic if it doesn't at this late stage get through.\" Since the deal was announced on Wednesday, both outgoing US president Biden and president-elect Trump have taken credit for getting it over the line. Sources close to the negotiations have praised the collaboration of both administrations, but some officials reportedly said Trump's envoy to the talks was decisive in securing the agreement of both parties. When Mr Marr asked if Trump was right to take credit, Mr Hunt said: \"I think he is actually right.

Trump had previously threatened there would 'all hell would break out' if a ceasefire deal and a return of the hostages by Hamas wasn't agreed before his inauguration on January 20. Finally, Mr Hunt was asked about Kemi Badenoch's admission that the Tory party 'made mistakes' on Brexit and left the EU 'without a growth plan', in her combative first speech of the year. Mr Hunt said: \"She's honest, it's a difficult thing to say, I think it is true. The truth is, I've always thought we can make a success of Brexit but it's up to us, it's not automatic.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "Former Conservative Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has apologised to the families of Lucy Letby’s victims. He told the families he was sorry \"for anything that didn't happen that could potentially have prevented such an appalling crime\". Speaking at the Thirlwall Inquiry, which is examining how the former nurse was able to murder babies on a neonatal unit in Chester in 2015 and 2016, Mr Hunt admitted the killings happened on “his watch.” Lucy Letby, widely considered to be Britain’s most prolific killer of children, is currently serving 15 whole-life orders after she was convicted at Manchester Crown Court of murdering seven infants and attempting to murder seven others between June 2015 and June 2016. Read more: Liz Truss sends cease and desist letter to Keir Starmer over 'defamatory' claim she 'crashed the economy' Mr Hunt said while he wasn't responsible for everything “on every ward” in the NHS, he does take some responsibility for Letby’s crimes. Mr Hunt said: \"This terrible tragedy happened on my watch and although I don't bear direct personal responsibility for everything that happens in every ward in the NHS, you do have ultimate responsibility for the NHS. \"And insofar as lessons were not learned from previous inquiries that could have been, or the right systems were not in place that could have prevented this appalling tragedy, then I do bear ultimate responsibility and I want to put on the record my apologies to the families for anything that did not happen that potentially could have prevented such an appalling crime.  \"I think one of the things that could have potentially meant that what happened at the Countess of Chester was spotted earlier and the dots were joined up would have been having medical examiners.\"  He suggested medical examiners should be trained to see the signs or patterns of malicious harm in the work of a healthcare professional and that having \"malicious actors\" such as Shipman and Letby at the backs of their minds could make a \"big difference\".  The inquiry heard that a non-statutory rollout of medical examiners in England and Wales began in 2019.  Mr Hunt said: \"I think the medical examiner system when it works well is incredibly important to a healthcare system because I think it's not just important for learning from mistakes, it's also very important for families who have been bereaved to have someone independent that they can talk to and raise concerns.  \"Feedback from relatives was a very important clue for them as to where things might be going wrong.\" It comes as Conservative former minister Sir David Davis has called for Letby to be retried.  The senior Tory said there was no \"hard evidence\" implicating Letby and the case against her was \"built on a poor understanding of probabilities\".  He told MPs: \"If, as I believe it will, a retrial clears Lucy Letby she shall be released in her 30s, not in her 50s.\" Lawyers for Letby last month said they would make a fresh bid to challenge her convictions on the grounds that the lead prosecution medical expert at her trial was \"not reliable\". During an adjournment debate in the Commons, Sir David told MPs: \"There is case in justice, in my view, for a retrial. But there is a problem. One of the problems we face is that much of the evidence was available at the time.   \"What I have described is an expert analysis of the case notes, which were there at the time, but it was simply not presented to the jury. \"This means the Court of Appeal can dismiss it, basically saying the defence should have presented it at the initial trial. \"It is in essence saying, 'if your defence team weren't good enough to present this evidence, hard luck you stay banged up for life'. Now that may be judicially convenient, but it's not justice.\"\n",

      "Five former Health Secretaries are backing calls for a national memorial to remember the tens of thousands of stillborn babies buried in mass graves around England.\n",
      "An LBC investigation has unearthed a culture of parents being routinely lied to about where their stillborn babies were being buried, with at least 89,000 known to be piled up in unmarked, mass graves around the country. Former Health Secretaries Jeremy Hunt, Andy Burnham, Stephen Dorrell, Alan Johnson and Therese Coffey have all voiced their support for a memorial to remember the babies buried in these graves. Read more: More than 89,000 stillborn babies buried in mass graves across England as parents search for childrens' remains Read more: Mass grave of more than 300 bodies including hundreds of babies and children found in Oldham cemetery Jeremy Hunt was the Health Secretary between 2012 and 2018, he told LBC: \"It's utterly shocking. I, frankly, can see how thirty, forty, fifty years ago life was a bit cheaper and some awful things happened in health services all over the world, but I think this was going on until really quite recently, including, I fear, during the period where I was Health Secretary. It's very important that it's now come to light and will be dealt with. \"It's absolutely heart-rending. I wasn't aware of this issue. I was aware of a slightly different issue that it wasn't possible to get birth certificates for a stillborn child, and for many grieving parents a recognition that their baby existed. It's still not possible for stillborn children, but you can now get a baby loss certificate which allows you to formally register that this child existed, but there's clearly more to do. \"What needs to happen now is the department of health needs to talk to these parents and say, \"would it be something that would help you to have a 'tomb of the unknown baby' sort of thing, and if it would help them in their grief then we should absolutely pursue it.\" Former Health Secretary, and now Manchester Mayor, Andy Burnham, told LBC: \"I think it's a troubling revelation for everyone to take on board, that there are those graves with all of those lost lives. \"For any parent who's been through that experience, any mother who's had a still birth, it will be a traumatic thing for the rest of their life. Then to have these revelations it brings it back.  \"We are working closely with the leader of Oldham Council to start to find out everything that is possible to find out. I think that's the main thing isn't it, having honesty from the authorities as to why these graves were there, which organisations were using those sites, giving people as much truth as we can possibly get, and then perhaps supporting parents with a permanent location, an appropriate location to go. \"I think there's a lot more to come out on this and we need to work to get maximum disclosure, maximum transparency and then an appropriate solution that comes from it.\" In September we reported on the discovery of a mass grave in Royton Cemetery which contains the remains of 145 stillborn infants, 128 babies and young children and 29 adults.  Oldham Council has told LBC it now plans to place permanent memorials in the borough’s seven cemeteries to remember babies, children and adults who were buried in unmarked graves. \"Over the coming weeks, memorial plinths – each inscribed with a poignant verse – and benches where relatives and friends can sit peacefully with their thoughts, will be installed at council burial sites. \"The plinths and benches were chosen after conversations were held with several families, who have all requested privacy and confidentiality. Councillor Arooj Shah, Leader of Oldham Council, said: “The last few months must have been horrible for anyone who has discovered their relative was buried in an unmarked grave. “Our thoughts and sympathies continue to go out to them. “Sadly, the burying of people - including babies and children - in unmarked communal graves happened in cemeteries across the country for many years. “Thankfully, this no longer happens, but it is wrong there was no acknowledgement of this in our cemeteries. “Over the last few months, we have looked at a range of options for the memorials, including one in a central location. We’ve taken our time as we want to get it right. “After listening to the views of the affected families we believe having somewhere discreet at each burial site, where people can sit down and quietly reflect and remember is the best way.  “Hopefully families affected by the insensitive practices of the past can now take some comfort knowing that soon there will be a place for them to come where their loss is acknowledged and remembered.” Cemetery staff will put the first memorials in place over the coming weeks. A candlelit vigil for the babies will be taking place in Royton on Sunday at 3pm.\n",

In a recording obtained by The Guardian, Mr Hunt said Ms Truss \"accepted the mistakes she'd made with good grace\" and said he wanted to adopt her plans, though \"more gradually\".

Asked about her legacy last September, she said: \"I do want to challenge this phrase 'crashed the economy.' \"The fact is that since I left office both mortgage rates and gilt rates have gone higher than they were at the time of the mini-budget. \"So I do think you are repeating a line to take from the Labour Party when you say that.\" The Labour Party has said Mr Hunt's remarks show the Conservatives are “addicted to dangerous Trussonomics”. Mr Hunt's comments also represent a different reading of Ms Truss' time in office compared with Rishi Sunak, who previously said: “Two years ago I wasn’t afraid to repeatedly warn about what her economic policies would lead to”.\n",

      "The Chancellor of the Exchequer unveiled a new Conservative pledge not to raise capital gains tax and stamp duty, or increase the number of council tax bands. Mr Hunt called on Labour leader Sir Keir to match his party's \"family home tax guarantee\". It comes after a day when Labour and the Conservatives have been rowing about tax, which the Tories believe shows a divide between the two parties. Rishi Sunak repeatedly accused Sir Keir of wanting to raise households' taxes by around £2,000 in a debate on Tuesday night. Sir Keir said this was \"garbage\" and later accused Mr Sunak of breaking the ministerial code. Read more: Rishi Sunak ‘breached ministerial code’ over Labour tax hike claim in leaders’ debate, Keir Starmer tells LBC Read more: Reform UK just two points behind Tories in latest polls but ex-minister tells LBC it's just initial 'spike' On Wednesday evening, the Conservatives said that, if they won the election, they would not increase the number of council tax bands, re-evaluate council tax revaluation or cut council tax discounts. They said they would keep private residence relief, so people do not pay capital gains tax on their main home when they sell it. They also said they would not increase the rate or level of stamp duty, in a show of support for homeowners. Criticising Labour, the Tories pointed to a paper Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves wrote in 2018 advocating council tax re-evaluations, which could result in higher taxes for many. Mr Hunt said: \"We know that Keir Starmer is going to raise your taxes by £2,094 but he won’t tell you where that money is going to come from because he doesn’t have a plan.  “Rachel Reeves has previously called for a range of damaging new taxes on the family home just like Labour are looking at doing in Labour-run Wales; and that means she and Keir Starmer are coming for your family home.   “Only Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives will protect your family home to give you peace of mind with our guarantee that there will be no rises in such taxes for the whole of the next Parliament.” Labour did not address the claims directly, but a spokesman said: \"We will not be raising taxes on working people. The Conservatives cannot be trusted on tax and taxes are at a 70-year high on their watch. \"These are more desperate claims from Rishi Sunak who lied to the British people before and is lying to them again.\" It comes after the first televised debate on Tuesday, when Mr Sunak repeatedly accused Labour of planning to hike taxes for the average household by £2,000, claiming that analysis showed Labour has a £38.5bn blackhole in its spending plans Sir Keir told LBC on Wednesday that Mr Sunak breached the ministerial code in doing so. He said of Mr Sunak: \"He lied, and he lied deliberately. Because we have made clear that our plans our fully costed, fully funded, they do not involve tax rises for working people. So that’s no income tax rise, no national insurance rise, no VAT rise”. Sir Keir continued: “The Prime Minister with his back against the wall, desperately trying to defend his awful record in office, resorted to lies and he knew what he was doing, he knew very well what he was doing. He lied about our plans and that is a true test of character\".\n",

      "Jeremy Hunt has refused to rule out new taxes if a Conservative government is elected, but has insisted the party’s ‘direction of travel’ is to lower taxation.\n",
      "The Chancellor told LBC’s Nick Ferrari at Breakfast: “A future Conservative government will not increase income tax, national insurance or VAT.” Mr Hunt also confirmed the commitment to not raising VAT was for the lifetime of the next government, if elected. Asked if he could confirm that there would be no new taxes for the whole of the next parliament, Mr Hunt said: “What I can say is we will not increase those three major taxes and I can’t predict what’s going to happen on every single tax but if you look at my record as Chancellor I have started to bring down the overall tax burden.” Pressed again on whether this meant he could not definitively rule out any new taxes under a future Conservative government, he continued: “I’m not going to write every single budget of the next parliament but I can tell you that our direction of travel will be to bring taxes down.” Follow the LBC live General Election blog for all the twists and turns of the campaign train and listen live to LBC on Global Player, our official app It comes after both the Conservatives and Labour ruled out VAT hikes if either party wins the General Election. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt warned that rises to taxes on products and services could \"hammer families' finances”. On Wednesday, Mr Hunt called on Labour to make the same pledge as he claimed the party had repeatedly refused to rule it out when asked at campaign events.

Ms Reeves said: \"Labour will not be increasing income tax, national insurance or VAT. \"I want taxes on working people to be lower, not higher. That is why we opposed the increases to national insurance when Rishi Sunak put those forward as chancellor.\" Meanwhile, Mr Hunt urged Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer to make a similar commitment \"on camera\". Meanwhile, the health spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats, Daisy Cooper, also confirmed that her party could rule out any future VAT increases. She told LBC: \"We can definitely rule that out. We've said repeatedly that during a cost of living crisis, the Liberal Democrats would never be looking to raise taxes on struggling families.\" It comes after the Conservatives unveiled their first election poster on Wednesday, which shows a giant red piggy bank bearing the words: \"If you think Labour will win, start saving...\" It claims Labour's fiscal plans would cost working families £2,094. During speeches earlier this week, Ms Reeves said Labour has no plans to announce new tax rises beyond already announced policies, including a plan to charge 20% VAT on private school fees. Mr Hunt has since claimed credit for the commitment, claiming that Labour had \"buckled under pressure\" to rule out VAT rises. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said the next UK government will face the toughest fiscal inheritance in 70 years.

      "Jeremy Hunt told LBC this morning that he is ‘very cross’ at Thames Water.\n",
      "\n",
      "Asked about the rising cost of people’s water bills and the looming rescue of Thames Water, Jeremy Hunt told Nick Ferrari: “I represent constituents who have been very badly served by Thames Water. “I’m very cross at them asking to be bailed out by them with big increases in their water bills when their owners have ramped up debt in the company that has put them in a very bad state. “What is very clear is that we need to invest more going forward. “Water companies will be spending £99bn in operating expenditure over the next five years. “We’ve banned water company bosses from taking bonuses if their record on sewage leaks is too bad. “We’ve said all the money from fines is going to back into cleaning up rivers.” He said Ofwat will “not want to reward companies that have behaved badly.” Read more: UK inflation falls to 2.3% in April but Jeremy Hunt warns 'cost of living crisis not over' Read more: Bailiff usage soars by nearly 50% as council debt blackhole hits £2.4bn, figures show Last week Thames Water’s biggest investor slashed the value of its stake in the company to zero in the latest sign of an escalating financial crisis for Britain’s biggest water supplier. Canadian pension fund Omers issued a “full writedown” of its 31.7% stake in Thames’s troubled parent company, signalling that it believes its share is worth nothing. Weeks ago Omers and the company’s other shareholders refused to give Thames Water £500m of emergency funding after branding its business plan “uninvestable.” Other Thames shareholders include the British university staff pension scheme USS and the BT Pension Scheme manager Hermes. None have taken a dividend from Thames since they bought into the business in 2017. Thames Water is racing to avoid a multi-billion pound taxpayer backed bailout. The firm could have to be placed into special administration which would mean the government stepping in and temporarily renationalising the company. Water regulator Ofwat is reportedly working on rescue plans for Thames that could lead to the water company’s regional monopoly being dismantled and sold off to neighbouring rival suppliers. An Ofwat spokesperson said: “Safeguards are in place to ensure that services to customers are protected, regardless of issues faced by the shareholders.” Last month Thames Water’s boss said bills need to rise by 40% by 2030 to pay for improvements. Chris Weston insisted the firm was \"quite a long way off\" from nationalisation and \"a lot that has to happen\" beforehand. However, he said it was \"eventually possible\".\n",

      "UK inflation fell to the lowest level in nearly three years in April as energy prices continued to cool, but the Chancellor warned that the cost of living crisis was not over.  \t\n",
      "Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation slowed to 2.3% in April, down from 3.2% in March, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said on Wednesday morning. It marks the lowest level since July 2021 when inflation was recorded at 2% - the Bank of England's target level.

In response to the latest inflation figures, a Treasury spokesperson said: \"We rightly protected millions of jobs during Covid and paid half of people's energy bills after Putin's invasion of Ukraine sent bills skyrocketing - but it wouldn't be fair to leave future generations to pick up the tab.  \t \"That's why we must stick to the plan to get debt falling. The economy is turning a corner, with strong growth this quarter and inflation close to target, allowing us to cut taxes for the average worker by £900 a year.\" However, the latest inflation figures are not the time for ministers to be \"taking a victory lap\", according to Rachel Reeves. In a statement released in response to the latest figures, the shadow chancellor said: \"Inflation has fallen, but now is not the time for Conservative ministers to be popping champagne corks and taking a victory lap.  \t \"After 14 years of Conservative chaos families are worse off. Prices in the shops have soared, mortgage bills have risen and taxes are at a 70-year high. Rishi Sunak is now putting family finances at risk again with his £46 billion unfunded policy to abolish national insurance that will mean higher borrowing, higher taxes or the end of the state pension as we know it.  \t \"It's time for change. Labour's first steps will deliver economic stability so we can grow our economy and keep taxes, inflation and mortgages as low as possible.\" Some commentators said the figures would not signal the end to the cost of living. Ben Harrison, Director of the Work Foundation at Lancaster University, said: “Workers across the country might be quietly relieved that their bills and shopping are rising at the lowest level since 2021.  \"But even at 2.3%, inflation remains above the Bank of England’s target and many people will be facing lower living standards for some time to come.\" Trades Union Congress (TUC) general secretary Paul Nowak said: \"The cost-of-living crisis is not over - no matter how much ministers pretend it is. Prices are still going up. Food and energy bills are much higher than a couple of years ago. And many are being hit by soaring mortgage repayments.\"  \t He continued: \"That's because household budgets have been decimated by the highest price rises in the G7 and wages have flatlined over the last 14 years.  \t \"Pay packets are still worth less today than in 2008, with working people on course to end this Parliament poorer than at the start. Make no mistake - the Tories have delivered the worst period for living standards in generations.\"\n",

      "Rachel Reeves has said Rishi Sunak and Jeremy Hunt are gaslighting Brits over the economy - as Labour analysis claims high inflation has cost workers almost the equivalent of a 1p hike in tax.\n",
      "The research found that the average earner was £180 worse off than they would have been had wages kept pace with inflation since October 2021. Labour produced the analysis ahead of the latest release of official data which is expected to show the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation for April falling to within touching distance of the Bank of England's 2% target. Read More: Chancellor warns Bank of England against cutting interest rates too quickly warning inflation could spike again Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves claimed that would result in ministers \"gaslighting the British people by telling them they never had it so good\". But Labour's analysis suggests a higher rate taxpayer earning £55,000 in October 2021 is £343 worse off because of higher prices, while if earnings had kept pace with inflation a 1p tax hike would have cost £377. For average earners real wages have dropped £180 since October 2021. If they had risen in line with inflation, an extra penny on income tax or national insurance would have cost £207. CPI inflation rose by 3.2% in the 12 months to March 2024, down from 3.4% in February, according to Office for National Statistics (ONS) data. The figure for April will be released on Wednesday and is expected to show a further decline in the rate at which prices are rising. Any decline is likely to be seized on by Chancellor Jeremy Hunt and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. The surge in inflation, which reached 11.1% in October 2022, has been influenced by factors including the emergence of global economies from the Covid-19 pandemic and then the energy price shock caused by the war in Ukraine. Ms Reeves said: \"Last week, Keir Starmer and I unveiled our first steps to turn the page on a decade of economic decline. \"We will make families better off by delivering economic stability with tough spending rules, so we can grow our economy and keep taxes, inflation and mortgages as low as possible. \"However, all Rishi Sunak and Jeremy Hunt can offer is more of the same. \"More chaos, more decline and more unfunded tax cuts. \"And this week we can once again expect to see Conservative ministers gaslighting the British people by telling them they have never had it so good, while leaving them hundreds of pounds worse off. \"It's time for change. It's time for Rishi Sunak to get out of his bunker and call a general election.\" With the economy and public finances one of the key election battlegrounds, the Tories have warned that Labour's spending plans would require tax rises. Treasury Chief Secretary Laura Trott said: \"While Labour want to raise your taxes, Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives are sticking with the plan which is working. \"Inflation is down from its peak of 11.1% to 3.2%, the economy is growing, wages are rising for the tenth month in a row, and we are cutting the double tax on work worth £900 for the average worker to put more money in people's pockets.\"\n",

      "A victim of the infected blood scandal has criticised the Chancellor's compensation announcement, telling LBC that it \"isn't about money... thousands of people died\".\n",
      "Tens of thousands of people were infected with contaminated blood or blood products between the 1970s and early 1990s. Around 3,000 are known to have died, but many more who unwittingly contracted hepatitis C may also have died. The scandal - dubbed the worst treatment disaster in the history of the NHS - has been the subject of the biggest ever public inquiry in the UK. Jeremy Hunt announced the compensation money the day before the inquiry announces its final report on Monday. Bill Wright warned LBC's Matthew Wright that the government's payout should not take focus away from the human aspect of the scandal. Mr Hunt said that he wanted to have \"close engagement\" with the victims and their families. Read More: Jeremy Hunt says £10bn infected blood payouts fulfil promise to constituent who died due to scandal Read More: What is the infected blood scandal? What you need to know about 'worst NHS treatment disaster' Mr Wright, who was given infected blood in the 1980s and has recently been diagnosed with liver cancer, said: \"This is quite a sinister move by government to try and talk today and tomorrow about money. This is about people, this is about thousands of people dying.  \"This is about thousands of people being not just physically harmed, or very badly meant mentally harmed.  \"This is about people who've asked questions like me over the years, and places where questions do not want to be asked.\" Mr Wright, the chairman of advocacy group Haemophilia Scotland, was given contaminated Factor 8 blood in 1986. He developed hepatitis C, and two years later was told he may have only ten years to live. Mr Wright said: \"I have found since over the years, that there were many people who like me, who were completely isolated.  \"You know, you didn't know what was happening with other people. And one of the things we've learned, of course, is that some people went for years, possibly even decades in ignorance, that they contracted the virus, because no medical professional told them that.\" Mr Wright went on several different drugs to try to cure his hepatitis, and eventually in 2015 found one that worked for him. But his liver had been scarred and he was left with cirrhosis, and in the past couple of months was diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma, a kind of liver cancer. He said that Monday's report announcement would be an \"earthquake\". Announcing a compensation package for victims in an interview in The Sunday Times, Mr Hunt told of how he promised to \"sort\" a fair and full settlement during a meeting with campaigner Mike Dorricott in 2014. Mr Dorricott was 46 at the time, and had learned just weeks before meeting Mr Hunt that he had terminal liver cancer - a disease linked to the hepatitis C he contracted as a teenager from contaminated Factor 8 blood products. After telling his family the news that he only had months to live, he visited the then health secretary, Mr Hunt, in Whitehall. He told the future Chancellor he was angry that infected patients and their families had not received a full and fair settlement. Towards the end of the meeting, Mr Hunt shook his hand and said: \"Don't worry about this, we'll sort it.\" Just a few months later, Mr Dorricott died, aged just 47. Mr Hunt told The Sunday Times that a new compensation package - expected to be at least £10 billion - for those affected by the scandal will be \"thanks to Mike more than anyone else\". He added: And it's one of the saddest things that he's not around to see it.\" The Chancellor told the paper that Mr Dorricott was \"so gentle, so decent\". \"I imagine after that meeting that Mike thought that he'd been fobbed off by yet another politician giving him the runaround,\" he said, adding: \"But what Mike didn't know was that he really had made a huge impression on me.\" Mr Hunt said the money will be funded through Government borrowing, and that the package could be unveiled as soon as Tuesday - when the final report of the inquiry is due to be published. He said the Government would look \"very sympathetically\" on any request from the victims or families for a national memorial. \"What we want to do after Monday is very close engagement with all the families who've been through such hell and understand from them what the next steps need to be,\" he said. Mr Dorricott's widow, Ann, 57, told the paper that the announcement \"brings me solace\". \"It brings me solace to know that even in death, Mike continues to make a difference,\" she said. \"He was a pillar of strength, fighting for justice until his last breath and his absence is deeply felt every day. \"I know that Mike always held Jeremy Hunt in high regard, and even though it has taken 10 years, he would be pleased that justice is finally being delivered to the victims.\"\n",

      "Mr Hunt claimed that Labour would raise taxes if they came to power under Keir Starmer - in contrast to the Conservatives, and accused the party of lying. \"Keir Starmer’s first step will not be the motherhood and apple pie we heard yesterday, but to help himself to you and your family’s wallets,\" he said. Labour said in response that Mr Hunt's speech was \"desperate\" and said that the Tories \"crashed the economy\". Both parties have accused the other of unfunded spending or fiscal plans. Under current plans, the overall tax burden is expected to rise over the next five years to around 37% of GDP, close to a post-Second World War high.

Mr Hunt said the big choice at the next general election would be about tax, and claimed that every Labour government since 1970 had raised the tax burden. “Conservative governments never do so by choice, and we’ve never accepted such decisions need to be permanent,\" he said.  \"That is why since that Autumn Statement [in 2022], decisions in my events have reduced the tax burden by 1% of GDP compared to what it would have been. \"Labour makes a different choice. For them higher tax is a means to a progressive end\". Mr Hunt claimed that under Labour would have to raise taxes to fund their plans for government, leaving a £38 billion gap of \"unfunded spending\". He added: \"Calling them a ‘myth’ is about as rude as I can get, but frankly it is a lie. \"I don’t make any bones about it. It is fake news and it is an absolute disgrace to try to win this election by scaring pensioners about a policy that is not true.\" He added: \"Our argument is this is about the future growth of our economy... More lightly-taxed economies have more dynamic private sectors, they grow faster and in the end that means more money for precious public services like the NHS.\" The Chancellor refused to commit to raising income tax thresholds, which have been described as a \"stealth tax\". He said: \"I can't today tell you what will be in the Conservative manifesto for the next parliament.  \"But what I can do is make a very clear argument that we will bring down taxes, and I can do so with credibility because that is already what we have been doing.\" Speaking to LBC News with Lisa Aziz, Shadow Science Minister & Labour MP for Hove Peter Kyle said: \"I just wish this government and any person who is in this Tory Government would accept responsibility for what they have delivered to our economy and country. \"Jeremy Hunt is part of a government that has put taxes up to a 70 year high. \"Even after the gimmicky tax cuts that they have announced in the last budget come in - most average people in this country will be £780 worse off, because of the other tax rises that are still coming in - and have been put in by the by this government. \"So, they have no credibility on this whatsoever.\" \"Mr Hunt also claimed that Britain's economy has \"turned a corner\", while admitting that it would take time for that \"to feed through to how people feel\". A Labour spokesperson said in response: \"This is another desperate attempt by the Tories to deflect from their £46 billion unfunded tax plan that could lead to higher borrowing, higher taxes on pensioners or the end of the state pension as we know it.  \t \"All of Labour's policies are fully costed and fully funded. Unlike the Conservatives, who crashed the economy, Labour will never play fast and loose with the public finances.  \t \"Jeremy Hunt would be better spent getting Rishi Sunak to confirm the date of the election, rather than putting out any more of these dodgy dossiers.\" It comes after Labour set out its six pledges ahead of the next general election. Speaking on Thursday, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer promised to deliver economic security, cut NHS waiting times, create a new border security command, set up a nationalised energy company, crack down on anti social behaviour, and recruit 6,500 new teachers. They will be the first things the party will do if Labour wins the keys to power at the upcoming election. Sir Keir said in a speech that Labour wants to show voters that \"decline is not inevitable\" and that \"politics can make a difference\". He told Labour activists: \"One card, six steps, in your hand - a plan to change the country. This is a message to take to every doorstep in the country.\" Speaking to LBC's Andrew Marr following the announcement, Tory party chairman Richard Holden said the six pledges were just \"woolly ideas\". He added that he \"doesn’t believe\" the party will deliver on its promises on neighbourhood policing and NHS waiting times. \"I was looking at the neighbourhood policing pledge, for example, which goes totally counter to what Labour in government, actually in local government as the Mayor of London, has been doing,\" Mr Holden said. \"He's stopped borough policing in London, there is no borough policing in the boroughs, yet Labour's talk about wanting neighbourhood police officers when they're actually able to deliver these things. \"They're not delivering what they say. I don't believe them, because when they are able to deliver it, they're not delivering it.  \"Look at the waiting lists in Wales, right, I want to see waiting lists come down right across the country, whether it's in England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and they're obviously higher than we'd like them to be because of the pandemic.  \"But the one place that they are significantly higher, very much higher than in England, is in Wales. And who's been running Wales for the last 25 years?  \"The Labour Party, and they get more funding per head there. I would just ask people, it's all very well to lay out these woolly ideas, but when it comes down to it, just like we've seen with their GB energy policy, there's now a £12 billion hole.  \"Let's be clear with the people about what it actually looks like as well.\"\n",

      "Mr Hunt will promise that \"taxes will go down under a Conservative government\" and accuse shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves of plotting hikes to fund Labour's spending pledges.  \t He will restate his plans to eliminate national insurance altogether - a move Labour has claimed is an unfunded £46 billion pledge.  \t Under current plans, the overall tax burden is expected to rise over the next five years to around 37 per cent of GDP, close to a post-Second World War high.

Labour do not.\"  \t He will say that \"the lower-taxed economies of North America and Asia generally grow faster than the higher-taxed economies of Europe\". Mr Hunt is set to stress that the Tories' \"ultimate aim\" is to continue cutting national insurance until it is eliminated, but only \"when it is affordable to do so\".  \t \"But with no plans to pay for their spending pledges, taxes will go up under any future Labour government as sure as night follows day,\" Mr Hunt will say.  \t \"And taxes will go down under a Conservative government because we will do the hard work necessary to keep our economy competitive.\" It comes after Labour set out its six pledges ahead of the next general election.

      "It comes after the Bank announced it is keeping the base rate of interest on hold at a 16-year-high of 5.25%. The Bank of England maintained interest rates at 5.25% at its May Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting.  However, governor Andrew Bailey has signalled optimism that it may soon be able to cut rates, possibly in June.  Mr Hunt has warned against moving too quickly, saying he would “much rather they waited until they’re absolutely sure inflation is on a downward trajectory”. The Chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, will join Nick Ferrari at Breakfast from 7am. Listen on Global Player, the official LBC app.  “What we want is sustainably low interest rates, and I think what’s encouraging is that the Bank of England governor, for the first time, has expressed real optimism that we’re on that path,” the Chancellor said.  The committee voted by a majority of seven to two to keep rates unchanged. Members Dave Ramsden and Swati Dhingra voted to cut rates by 0.25 percentage points.

I'm optimistic that things are moving in the right direction.\" The MPC indicated it is still looking for more progress on factors including services inflation and wage growth, which have remained persistently high at about 6%, before cutting rates. Inflation is expected to fall more than previously thought over the coming years, the Bank of England has projected, dropping below its 2% target to 1.5% in 2026. Headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation is expected to fall below the Bank's 2% target between April and June, but rise again to 2.6% in the second half of this year as the impact of recent drops in energy prices fades. In the longer term, the Bank dropped its projections for CPI inflation to 2.25% for 2025 and 1.5% in 2026, down 0.25 and 0.5 percentage points respectively on February estimates. The projection came in the Bank's May Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) report, which signalled optimism from recent falls in retail inflation. The report said persistently high interest rates had helped push headline inflation down, as the MPC voted again to maintain rates at 5.25%. The pound fell against the US dollar and euro after the Bank of England signalled growing support for an interest rate cut among policymakers.  \t Sterling fell 0.3% to 1.246 US dollars and was 0.2% lower at 1.161 euros.\n",

      "Rachel Reeves has slapped down Rishi Sunak's claims that Britain is heading for a hung Parliament - as she hit out at the Tories for \"gaslighting\" voters over the economy.\n",
      "Soaring interest rates could be cut and Britain out of recession this month, the shadow chancellor predicted too. In a major economic speech ahead of a crunch Bank of England rates decision this week, Ms Reeves insisted Labour would take the fight to the Tories over the economy. She said a legacy of 14 years of Tory government had made people worse off. But she refused to lay out much detail of how she would reboot Britain's sluggish economy, saying it would be \"reckless\" to lay out unfunded spending cuts. Speaking in the City of London days after Labour swept to victory in last week's local elections, she rejected his suggestions Britain could be on course for a hung parliament. And she insisted that the places Labour are winning are exactly where they need to be to form the next government. Ms Reeves said: \"We are fighting for every vote.... we can feel confident coming out of those elections that the message putting forward is resonating. \"I don't think they point to a hung Parliament. \"If Rishi Sunak is so convinced the election is so close, there's one way to test that... call an election and let the people decide.\" The PM suggested yesterday that the election was \"not a foregone conclusion\" and there was still hope for the Tories yet. He pointed to a predicted vote share from last week's elections - which if replicated at a general poll would show Labour short of a majority. However, the shadow chancellor did admit that the party had lost some Muslim voters as a result of their stance over the Middle East. Independents and Greens hoovered up votes in some parts of the country last week as some voters took aim at Labour for not pushing hard enough for a ceasefire. She admitted: \"They did have concerns, including people in the Muslim community. We will seek to try and rebuild that in the weeks and months ahead.\" In a drive-by of the Tory economic record, she accused the Chancellor Jeremy Hunt and PM of being \"deluded and out of touch with realities on the ground\", adding: \"The Conservatives are gaslighting the British public. They don't speak to economic reality.\" Living standards are lower than when the Tories came to power, real incomes are down, and the economy is smaller than when the PM first came in, she said. However, she predicted that the economy would be looking brighter - possibly as soon as later this month - with interest rates on track to fall and inflation dropping further too. Labour would not be doing a \"victory lap\" to celebrate if they got into power, she said. But when grilled by reporters, she suggested she would not be promising to unfreeze the freezing of income \"stealth tax\" thresholds anytime soon. She said: \"I have made no bones about wanting taxes on working people to be lower... [but] I'm not going to make any unfunded tax cuts or spending commitments.\" Ms Reeves called the PM's ambition to slash National Insurance again as the \"last desperate throw of the dice\" and \"no answers on how they will pay for it\". She said: \"The questions people will ask are... do you and family feel better off after 14 years of Conservative government? Do our schools, hospitals, work better than 14 years ago? Does anything in our country work better? \"The choice at the election is simply - five more years of chaos, continuing Britain on economic decline. \"Or stability with a changed labour party, offering hope, to make working people better off. \"It's time to turn the page, start a new chapter, and labour is ready.\"\n",

      "Jeremy Hunt has admitted that Britain needs to increase defence spending – but no extra cash is set to be given before the general election.\n",
      "Mr Hunt said the UK, along with other European allies, must take more responsibility for their own security amid growing tensions with Russia and Iran. He added that former president Donald Trump was right to call for Europe to increase its defence spending. \"It’s very important that European countries recognise that, when it comes to America’s role in the world, we are actors, not observers,\" the Chancellor said. \"In the end, we have to be prepared to spend more on defence. That is a reasonable request from the United States that Europe contributes more to its own defence.\" Mr Hunt previously said he would increase defence spending to 2.5 per cent of GDP once it is affordable to do so. But the government is facing growing calls to speed up its cash injection into the military. Read more: Israel 'will make own decisions' in response to Iran attack, says Benjamin Netanyahu after meeting with David Cameron Read more: Iran must be 'hit back twice as hard', says ex-defence secretary Ben Wallace as Rishi Sunak calls for 'restraint' Former Armed Forces minister James Heappey hit out at the lack of action on Wednesday evening, after it was revealed that there would be no increase in defence spending before the general election. It came after Mr Heappey submitted a written parliamentary question asking when the increase would happen.  Chief Secretary to the Treasury Laura Trott responded saying the path to 2.5 per cent \"will be set out at the next Spending Review\". But a Spending Review is not due to take place this year, suggesting increases will not be made until the next Parliament. \"The government’s aspiration is to invest 2.5% of GDP on defence, when the fiscal and economic circumstances allow,\" Ms Trott said.  \"The Prime Minister has been clear that the target and path towards 2.5% will be set out at the next Spending Review. \"The government has consistently prioritised defence spending.  \"The Ministry of Defence was the first department to get certainty on its budgets in this Parliament.  \"This settlement was the largest sustained spending increase in defence since the end of the Cold War, with a £24 billion uplift in cash terms over the four-year period.  \"In March 2023, we also provided an extra £11 billion for defence and national security priorities over the next five years, with £4.95 billion over the next two years.\" In response, Mr Heappey said he was \"hugely disappointed\". \"It treats an increase in defence funding as just another routine government spending decision which can wait until a post-election spending review,\" he added, according to the Mail.  \"It is as if Treasury mandarins are not watching the news or reading their intelligence reports. The world is getting more dangerous, our brave armed forces are ever busier, and yet the Treasury simply won't bother to engage until next year.\" Other former defence ministers have also been critical over the lack of investment. Mark Francois said: \"The parallels with the 1930s, when our then Chancellor, Neville Chamberlain, persistently resisted increasing defence spending are becoming starker by the day. \"With Russian tank factories working around the clock, someone needs to send HM Treasury a copy of Winston Churchill's history of the Second World War - and explain to them what happens if you don't maintain strong defence spending.\" Ex-defence secretary Ben Wallace previously tweeted: \"Nearly every Nato country has increased defence spending since the invasion of Ukraine. We haven't.\"\n",

      "Jeremy Hunt has doubled down on his claim that £100,000 a year 'doesn’t go as far as you might think; after he was criticised for being out of touch.\n",
      "The Chancellor said earlier this weekend in a post on X that £100k for people in his South West Surrey constituency was \"not a huge salary\". The median salary for a full-time worker was just under £35,000 last year. He made the remark while discussing calls he had been making to residents as part of his work as a constituency MP. He has not defended his claim, saying people in his constituency were living in an area with very high house prices. It comes after Labour hit out at the chancellor and his claim, saying it revealed how \"desperately out of touch\" the Tory Government is. Read More: Jeremy Hunt says government 'committed' to pensions triple lock, but refuses to confirm WASPI compensation Read More: Labour calls Jeremy Hunt 'desperately out of touch' after Chancellor says £100,000 is 'not a huge salary' The chancellor told Sky News Sunday morning: \"What sounds like a large salary – when you have house prices averaging around £670,000 in my area and you’ve got a mortgage and childcare costs – it doesn’t go as far as you might think. \"We weren’t able to afford to fund childcare for people on the higher salaries but I was simply saying that’s something I’d love to be able to look at in the next parliament.” He maintained his defence on the BBC, telling the outlet: “I do accept that even on those higher salaries, people are feeling under pressure.\" Hunt said the cost of housing, childcare, and taxes meant that the salary did not go as far as people think. Shadow paymaster general Jonathan Ashworth hit out at the chancellor, saying her was \"desperately out of touch\". Ashworth said: \"The overwhelming majority of working people in this country would dream of earning that, yet they are all being made to pay the price of 14 years of Tory failure. \"It is staggering for the Chancellor to complain about mortgage costs when it was the Conservatives who crashed the economy with their kamikaze budget and sent mortgage costs through the roof. \"Only a Labour government will stand up for working people and tackle the cost-of-living crisis.\" It comes after Tory minister Dame Andrea Leadsom said the drop in inflation meant that we were \"seeing the cost-of-living crisis end\".

I think people will welcome the fact that inflation has fallen. \"But we're not there yet, and we need to stick to the course because we need inflation to get down to 2 per cent. \"The thing that will make the biggest difference for families up and down the country is when interest rates fall, and therefore their mortgage rates start to fall.\" In his Budget earlier this month, Hunt announced an increase in the threshold at which the high-income child benefit charge starts from £50,000 to £60,000 from April. He also announced that partial child benefit would be paid where the highest earner earns up to £80,000. Working parents can receive free childcare for youngsters aged three and four. To qualify, the majority must earn more than £8,670, but less than £100,000 per year under current rules.\n",

      "Jeremy Hunt has restated the government's commitment to keeping the pensions triple lock in place.\n",
      "Mr Hunt said the government would \"absolutely\" maintain its promise to raise the state pension every year by wage growth, inflation or 2.5%, whichever is highest. \"We made that commitment to pensioners and we think it's a very important one,\" he told the BBC on Sunday. But the Chancellor did not promise to compensate women who were hit by changes to state pension eligibility. Campaigners have accused the government of failing to inform women born in the 1950s about an increase in the entitlement age. Read more: Millions of 'Waspi' women 'owed' huge compensation payouts after government's state pension age blunder Read more: Women ‘owed’ £36bn in compensation payouts after government’s state pension age blunder, WASPI chairwoman says Speaking to broadcasters, the Chancellor denied pushing the decision to the right for a future administration to deal, with as Labour enjoys a sustained double-digit lead in opinion polls ahead of this year's election. He said the issue highlighted by the Women Against State Pension Inequality (Waspi) campaign was \"genuinely more complicated\" than others in which compensation has been promised, like the infected blood disaster and the Post Office Horizon scandal. A report by the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman (PHSO) suggests that millions of women affected by the pension scandal should be compensated. The payout could see the government facing a bill of nearly £8billion. Legislation introduced in 1995 raised the state pension age from 60 to 65 between 2010 and 2020 in order to bring it in line with that of men. Women born in the 1950s were adversely affected, with the Pensions Act of 2011 accelerating the shift so that the change was completed by November 2018. Around 2.6 million women are estimated to have been affected, the report suggests. Baroness Altmann, the former pensions minister, described the report's findings as “damning”. \"It highlights clear failings and indicates that millions of women are owed an apology, to acknowledge the impact on their retirement plans, but does not recommend the level of compensation many Waspi women were hoping for. “An apology would be a start, but will not pay the bills for those plunged into poverty as a result of not knowing their State Pension Age had been increased. Nor will it remedy the distress, anger and anxiety for women born during the 1950s,\" she told The Telegraph.\n",

      "Vacuum tycoon Sir James has been critical of the government's economic approach in recent months.  The billionaire entrepreneur has also praised Mr Hunt's predecessor as Chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, whose mini-budget precipitated the end of his tenure and Liz Truss' premiership. The exchange between Mr Hunt and Sir James came during a meeting at the Treasury last week to discuss tax relief for research and development, as first reported by the Financial Times. A civil service source told the Telegraph that \"no voices were raised but Jeremy just pointed out that as someone who used to run his own business, he knows that changing things in the public sector is more complex than the private sector and so maybe Sir James should give it a try and find out for himself.\" Read more: Inflation eases to 3.4% in February, the lowest level in two years, down from 4% last month Read more: UK economy returns to growth after GDP rose 0.2% in January - raising hopes country is on its way out of recession The source said that the meeting was \"courteous\", but the Financial Times reported that it was seen as \"awful\" by some participants. Sir James has previously said that the UK is not prioritising economic growth enough, and risks falling behind other countries. Brexit backer Sir James, who claims to have invested £1.7 billion in the UK over the past five years, said that \"wealth generation and growth\" have become \"dirty words\". \"I’ve always believed that inflation isn’t quite the enemy everyone thinks it is,\" he added. “If you’ve got growth, a bit of inflation doesn’t matter. If you get inflation down and kill growth, I think you’re in trouble.\" It comes as the UK slipped into recession in the final quarter of 2023, although the economy grew slightly again in January. Meanwhile figures released on Thursday show that inflation is at its lowest rate since September 2021. Sir James told the Telegraph in December: “I’m disappointed we’re not going for growth. I’ve made that plain. “I was hopeful [with Ms Truss and Mr Kwarteng]. I thought they were doing the right thing – I’m the only one who did. “Mr Kwarteng wasn’t raising taxes. He was going for growth, which I think is the right thing. It allows us to pay for things and generates wealth.” Spokespeople for Sir James and the Treasury both declined to comment on claims about the recent meeting.\n",

      "The Institute for Fiscal Studies issued the warning in its post-Budget briefing on Thursday morning.  IFS director Paul Johnson expressed doubt over whether the Government would be able to stick to its spending plans for the upcoming year due to the country’s “fiscal realities”. He said: “Ignoring the vagaries of the current, rather bizarre, fiscal targets these underlying facts are going to constrain chancellors for the foreseeable future. \"Fiscal rules or no, fiscal realities bite,” he told a briefing.  “The combination of high debt interest payments and low forecast nominal growth means that the next parliament could well prove to be the most difficult of any in 80 years for a chancellor wanting to bring debt down. \"Even stabilising debt as a fraction of national income is likely to mean some eye-wateringly tough choices, and we are talking tens of billions of pounds worth of tough choices, on tax and spending.\" Read more: Rishi Sunak and Jeremy Hunt 'aim to axe National Insurance entirely', as Labour call Budget 'damp squib' Read more: Chancellor hails his 'BMW' Budget - but Labour warns of 'cynical gimmick' that leaves many people worse off It comes after Mr Hunt announced a 2p cut to National Insurance contributions for employees in his Budget on Wednesday, from 10%-8%, with the change to come into effect from April 6.  But the Chancellor and Prime Minister have also indicated that they want to scrap national insurance altogether. Mr Sunak said on Wednesday evening that abolishing national insurance was \"our ambition long term\", without giving a schedule. The tax cut could reduce government revenues by around £50 billion per year. Mr Johnson hit out at the Prime Minister’s indicated goal, as he said cutting the tax altogether was not “realistic”.  “Tax has risen to a higher fraction of national income than it has ever been in my lifetime, and I don't expect it to return to its previous level for the rest of my lifetime,” he said.  He also warned that by accepting the slashed national insurance contributions, Labour had “made life more difficult for itself”. “That is £10 billion a year they have lost. The opposition have been just as shy as the chancellor about telling us what they actually intend to do on taxes and spending after the election.” “If I am sceptical about Mr Hunt's ability to stick to his current spending plans, I am at least that sceptical that Rachel Reeves will preside over deep cuts in public service spending,” he added. \n",

      "Speaking after the Budget announcement on Wednesday, which saw her Conservative counterpart Jeremy Hunt cut National Insurance, the Shadow Chancellor said Labour has \"no intention of making working people pay more in tax\". Ms Reeves told LBC's Iain Dale that there were a few \"targeted\" areas in which taxes would increase: private equity bosses’ bonuses, energy company profits and private schools being made to pay VAT and business rates. But \"we don’t have any tax increases beyond those,\" she said during the phone-in.  \"We think that with the tax burden at a 70-year high, we would like taxes on working people to be lower, and we have no intention of making working people pay more in tax\".

A general election is very likely to take place this year - perhaps as soon as May - with Labour firm favourites to win. That means Ms Reeves is likely to be the Chancellor within a few months. Pressed for more details on how a future Labour government might cut taxes, she said that \"fiscal drag is a big problem\". Ms Reeves said: \"There are going to be millions more people paying tax by the end of the forecast period than there were previously, because as inflation and incomes grow, but the tax threshold doesn’t increase, more people are dragged into paying tax even though they’re really no better off because prices have just increased. I think that is a problem.\" She added: \"My ambition is to grow the economy, that’s the number one mission of an incoming Labour government.  \"And if we grow the economy in the way that I expect to then we will have money to be able to reduce the burden of tax on working people, and… have the money for some of that crucial public spending that is needed.\" Mr Hunt earlier announced a series of fiscal measures that would be rolled out over the next few years, including modest cuts to National Insurance tax and frozen fuel and alcohol duty. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said in response that \"Britain deserves better\" and his party is \"ready\" to govern.

Continuing his rebuttal, Sir Keir said: \"There we have it, the last desperate act of a party that has failed. Britain in recession, the national credit card maxed out, and despite the measures today, the highest tax burden for 70 years.\" \"That is their record, it is still their record, give with one hand and take even more with the other, and nothing they do between now and the election will change that.\" Read More: Budget at a glance: Chancellor Jeremy Hunt announced National Insurance tax cuts and alcohol and fuel duty freezes Read More: Hunt hands £450 to millions and overhauls child benefit in 'tax-cutting' budget - but bad news for non-doms and smokers Sir Keir then referred to the prime minister and the chancellor as the \"chuckle brothers of decline\". He told the Commons: \"The Chancellor, who breezes into this chamber in a recession and tells the working people of this country that everything's on track. Crisis? What crisis? Or as the captain of the Titanic and the former Prime Minister herself might have said, iceberg? What iceberg? \"Smiling as the ship goes down, the chuckle brothers of decline, dreaming of Santa Monica or maybe just a quiet life in Surrey not having to self-fund his election.\" Turning to some of the policies announced, Sir Keir said the Conservatives were trying to save their own skin by assuming Labour's policy of abolishing non-domicile status for wealthy foreign nationals.  He said copying the Labour policy was \"a desperate move\" before asks why they did not do it earlier. Labour's Shadow Health Secretary Wes Streeting yesterday told LBC's Andrew Marr that he expected the Conservative government to 'nick' his party's flagship non-dom policy. The loophole lets foreign nationals who live in Britain but are domiciled overseas avoid paying UK tax on overseas income or capital gains. Read More: The government has its budget priorities wrong, public services suffer as they prioritise tax cuts over vital investment Read More: Jeremy Hunt freezes duty on fuel and alcohol as he unveils pre-election 'tax-cutting' Budget Starmer also welcomed the government's cut to national insurance, but claimed Mr Sunak had broken a promise to cut income tax. Sir Keir said: \"Because we have campaigned to lower the tax burden on working people for the whole Parliament, and we won't stop now, we will support the cuts to national insurance today. \"But I noticed this in 2022 when the Prime Minister was chancellor, he made this promise: 'I can confirm in 2024 for the first time the basic rate of income tax will be cut from 20 to 19 pence'. \"Having briefed that all week, that an income tax cut was coming, that promise is in tatters today.\" He also claimed Mr Sunak was overseeing a \"Rishi recession\" as he hit out at the Government's record on the economy. The Labour leader said it remains true that taxes are at \"a 70-year high\" despite the Chancellor's budget, adding: \"The British people paying more for less, an unprecedented hit to living standards of working people, the first time they have gone backwards over a Parliament, and they were cheering that today. \"The reason is equally simple, there is no plan for growth. How can there be? He can say 'long-term plan' all he likes,\" Sir Keir added to jeers from the Prime Minister and Chancellor. He insisted it was a \"statistical sleight of hand\" by ministers to claim Britain has grown more quickly than countries like Germany over the last 14 years, telling MPs: \"Indeed, in per capita terms, our economy has not grown since the first quarter of 2022, the longest period of stagnation Britain has seen since 1955.\" Sir Keir said: \"There is nothing technical about working people living in recession for every second the Prime Minister has been in power. This is a Rishi recession.\"\n",

      "Providing his rebuttal to the Government's Spring Budget in the House of Commons this afternoon, Sir Keir said \"Britain deserves better\" and his party is \"ready\" to govern. Mr Hunt earlier announced a series of fiscal measures that would be rolled out over the next few years, including modest cuts to National Insurance tax and frozen fuel and alcohol duty. Speaking following the vote on the Budget, the Labour leader called for the government to \"break a habit of 14 years\" and to \"confirm May 2 as the date of the next general election\". Continuing his rebuttal of the budget, Sir Keir said: \"There we have it, the last desperate act of a party that has failed. Britain in recession, the national credit card maxed out, and despite the measures today, the highest tax burden for 70 years.\" \"That is their record, it is still their record, give with one hand and take even more with the other, and nothing they do between now and the election will change that.\" Read More: Budget at a glance: Chancellor Jeremy Hunt announced National Insurance tax cuts and alcohol and fuel duty freezes Read More: Hunt hands £450 to millions and overhauls child benefit in 'tax-cutting' budget - but bad news for non-doms and smokers Sir Keir then referred to the prime minister and the chancellor as the \"chuckle brothers of decline\". He told the Commons: \"The Chancellor, who breezes into this chamber in a recession and tells the working people of this country that everything's on track. Crisis? What crisis? Or as the captain of the Titanic and the former Prime Minister herself might have said, iceberg? What iceberg? \"Smiling as the ship goes down, the chuckle brothers of decline, dreaming of Santa Monica or maybe just a quiet life in Surrey not having to self-fund his election.\" Turning to some of the policies announced, Sir Keir said the Conservatives were trying to save their own skin by assuming Labour's policy of abolishing non-domicile status for wealthy foreign nationals.  He said copying the Labour policy was \"a desperate move\" before asks why they did not do it earlier. Labour's Shadow Health Secretary Wes Streeting yesterday told LBC's Andrew Marr that he expected the Conservative government to 'nick' his party's flagship non-dom policy. The loophole lets foreign nationals who live in Britain but are domiciled overseas avoid paying UK tax on overseas income or capital gains. Read More: The government has its budget priorities wrong, public services suffer as they prioritise tax cuts over vital investment Read More: Jeremy Hunt freezes duty on fuel and alcohol as he unveils pre-election 'tax-cutting' Budget Starmer also welcomed the government's cut to national insurance, but claimed Mr Sunak had broken a promise to cut income tax. Sir Keir said: \"Because we have campaigned to lower the tax burden on working people for the whole Parliament, and we won't stop now, we will support the cuts to national insurance today. \"But I noticed this in 2022 when the Prime Minister was chancellor, he made this promise: 'I can confirm in 2024 for the first time the basic rate of income tax will be cut from 20 to 19 pence'. \"Having briefed that all week, that an income tax cut was coming, that promise is in tatters today.\" He also claimed Mr Sunak was overseeing a \"Rishi recession\" as he hit out at the Government's record on the economy. The Labour leader said it remains true that taxes are at \"a 70-year high\" despite the Chancellor's budget, adding: \"The British people paying more for less, an unprecedented hit to living standards of working people, the first time they have gone backwards over a Parliament, and they were cheering that today. \"The reason is equally simple, there is no plan for growth. How can there be? He can say 'long-term plan' all he likes,\" Sir Keir added to jeers from the Prime Minister and Chancellor. He insisted it was a \"statistical sleight of hand\" by ministers to claim Britain has grown more quickly than countries like Germany over the last 14 years, telling MPs: \"Indeed, in per capita terms, our economy has not grown since the first quarter of 2022, the longest period of stagnation Britain has seen since 1955.\" Sir Keir said: \"There is nothing technical about working people living in recession for every second the Prime Minister has been in power. This is a Rishi recession.\"\n",

      "Jeremy Hunt delivered the government's Spring Budget on Wednesday afternoon, where he promised tax cuts to national insurance and alcohol and fuel duty freezes.\n",
      "Hoping to turn around the Conservative Party's general election hopes as voters head to the polls later this year, the Chancellor announced modest tax cuts, further levelling up funding and additional ISA initiatives. Mr Hunt announced a variety of fiscal measures that will be rolled out over the next few years - many of which will require the Conservatives to win the next scheduled general election and extend their 14 years in power. Mr Hunt has announced a 2p cut to National Insurance contributions for employees that will come into effect from April 6. The chancellor has been under pressure, particularly from Tory MPs, to cut taxes currently at a historic high. National Insurance contributions are paid by employees and the self-employed on their earnings, as well as employers. The amount paid depends on an individual's salary. A further 2p cut is worth around £450 a year for someone on a full-time salary of £35,000. Cutting National Insurance is cheaper than cutting income tax. Some Conservative MPs, however, fear it is less well understood by many voters and so is less beneficial politically. Read More: Jeremy Hunt freezes duty on fuel and alcohol as he unveils pre-election 'tax-cutting' Budget Read More: LIVE: Jeremy Hunt hails ‘tax-cutting’ Budget with 2p National Insurance cut set to save Brits £900 The Chancellor said the government would abolish the non-domiciled tax status for wealthy foreign residents living in the UK. He has effectively assumed the policy that Labour previously said they would install once they come into power. Mr Hunt said the change would make the system \"fairer and competitive\". However, he said it would be replaced with a \"modern residency system\". The child benefit threshold has also been raised, the chancellor announced, providing more help to parents. The high-income charge threshold will increase from £50,000 to £60,000 and the taper will extend up to £80,00. He said the new rule will apply to collective household income rather than individually. Mr Hunt said he aims to introduce this by April 2026. The chancellor said he intends to reform the ISA system to encourage more people to invest in UK assets. \"After a consultation on its implementation, I will introduce a brand new British Isa which will allow an additional £5,000 annual investment for investments in UK equity with all the tax advantages of other ISAs. \"This will be on top of the existing ISA allowances and ensure that British savers can benefit from the growth of the most promising UK businesses as well as supporting them with the capital to help them expand.\" This is intended to encourage more people and funds to invest in UK stocks and shares. Currently, only around four per cent of pension funds invest in British assets. Continuing his Budget, the chancellor said there would be additional £2.5 billion funding for the NHS over the coming year. Mr Hunt said: \"On top of funding this longer-term transformation, we will also help the NHS meet pressures in the coming year with an additional £2.5 billion. \"This will allow the NHS to continue its focus on reducing waiting times and brings the total increase in NHS funding since the start of the parliament to 13% in real terms.\" For the 14th year running, fuel duty will be frozen - amounting to around a £5 billion tax break for motorists. Mr Hunt said he has \"decided to maintain the 5p cut and freeze fuel duty for a further 12 months. This will save the average car driver £50 next year and bring total savings since the 5p cut was introduced to around £250.\" The chancellor said alcohol duties will also remain frozen until February 2025, with the aim of \"backing the great British pub\". \"Today I have decided to extend the alcohol duty freeze until February 2025. This benefits 38,000 pubs all across the UK - and on top of the £13,000 saving a typical pub will get from the 75% business rates discount I announced in the autumn. Mr Hunt added: \"Taken together with the alcohol duty freeze, this decision also reduces headline inflation by 0.2 percentage points in 2024-25 allowing us to make faster progress towards the Bank of England's 2% target.\" The Government will also introduce a new tax on vapes in a bid to discourage non-smokers from taking up the habit. Mr Hunt told the Commons he was confirming \"the introduction of an excise duty on vaping products from October 2026 and publishing a consultation on its design\". However, he said that because vapes \"play a positive role\" in helping smokers quit, there will also be a one-off increase in tobacco duty to ensure vaping remains cheaper than smoking. Vaping products are currently subject to VAT at 20 per cent but, unlike tobacco, they are not also subject to excise duty.  \tThe Government has already published its plans to ban disposable vapes and will bring in new powers to restrict vape flavours and packaging.\n",

      "Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has delivered a pre-election boost for voters with an extension to the freeze on alcohol and fuel duty.\n",
      "The Chancellor delivered his Budget in the Commons on Wednesday, in a last bid to win over voters ahead of the general election. He confirmed that fuel duty will not increase in line with inflation and the 5p per litre cut implemented in March 2022 will be retained for another 12 months. He also extended the alcohol duty freeze until February 2025.  Speaking in the Commons, Mr Hunt said: \"This benefits 38,000 pubs all across the UK – and on top of the £13,000 saving a typical pub will get from the 75% business rates discount I announced in the Autumn.  \"We value our hospitality industry and we are backing the great British pub.\" The Chancellor first froze alcohol duty in his Autumn Statement until August 2024. It was due to rise by 3 per cent but will now remain the same for a further six months.

Mr Hunt's decision to maintain the freeze on fuel duty has been welcomed by motoring groups. The average cost of a litre of petrol and diesel at UK forecourts is around £1.45 and £1.55 respectively, government figures show. Prices reached record highs of £1.92 for petrol and £1.99 for diesel in July 2022, largely due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine leading to an increase in the cost of oil. RAC head of policy Simon Williams said: \"With a general election looming, it would have been a huge surprise for the Chancellor to tamper with the political hot potato that is fuel duty in today's Budget. \"It appears the decision of if or when duty will be put back up again has been quietly passed to the next government. \"But, while it's good news that fuel duty has been kept low, it's unlikely drivers will be breathing a collective sigh of relief as we don't believe they've fully benefited from the cut that was introduced just two years ago due to retailers upping margins to cover their 'increased costs'. \"This has meant fuel prices have been higher than they would otherwise have been. \"What's more, despite today's positive news it's still the case that drivers are once again enduring rising prices at the pumps, sparked by the oil price going up - the average cost of a litre is already up by more than 4p since the start of the year.\" Read more: Jeremy Hunt commits to free childcare pledge despite funding fears The alcohol industry has also welcomed the extension of the alcohol duty freeze. Stephen Russell, founder of Copper Rivet Distillery and spokesman for the UK Spirits Alliance, said: \"The Chancellor has raised the spirits of distillers, hospitality businesses and consumers alike.  \t \"Maintaining the freeze announced in the autumn is good news for spirits drinkers, good news for pubs and bars and the wider economy, and good news for the Treasury as it will enhance revenue for the Exchequer.  \t \"Spirits continue to be the highest taxed alcohol category in the UK - most people are shocked to hear that 80% of a bottle of gin is tax. We have the highest spirits duty rate among G7 nations, despite being a national success story.  \t \"We look forward to engaging with HM Treasury on how we improve this.\"  \t Scotch Whisky Association chief executive Mark Kent said: \"The industry welcomes the Chancellor's recognition of the benefits of continuing the duty freezes beyond August this year.  \t \"That decision supports the Scotch whisky industry, will incentivise investment and, as with previous cuts and freezes, boost Treasury revenue.  \t \"With cost pressures hurting our bars and pubs, not to mention hard-pressed consumers, the Treasury has provided some much-needed certainty and stability for the year ahead.\" However, health campaigners have condemned the \"appalling\" decision at a time of \"record high\" alcohol-related deaths.  \t Professor Sir Ian Gilmore, chairman of the Alcohol Health Alliance UK, said: \"Increasing alcohol duty is one of the most effective ways to increase Treasury revenue, reduce alcohol harm and protect the NHS.  \t \"It is appalling that once again the Chancellor has passed on the opportunity to boost government spending and improve public health, in favour of a tax break for the multibillion-pound alcohol industry.  \t \"At a time when we are experiencing record-high alcohol deaths and public finances are under extreme pressure, increasing duty is fundamental in reducing the burden caused by alcohol.  \t \"The tax cut afforded to the alcohol industry today is the result of lobbying from powerful multinational corporations. It further highlights the need for an automatic duty escalator to be reinstated to protect the decision from the influence of industry each year.\"\n",

      "Mr Hunt said the planned cut would deliver \"more opportunity and more prosperity\".  \t He said families “want a society… where if they work hard, they can bring home more money for their family.”  “It is possible if we stick to a plan,” he added. The Chancellor, who has faced pressure from Tory MPs to ease the record-high tax burden, promised \"permanent cuts in taxation\" that would bring \"higher growth\" as he seeks to woo voters ahead of this year's general election.   He looks likely to announce a cut in national insurance by a further two percentage points on Wednesday, matching a cut in the autumn statement.  Budget 2024 LIVE: Jeremy Hunt set to give workers a £450 boost with 2p cut to National Insurance The National Insurance change could save the average worker £450 a year, adding up to £900 when combined with last year's move. Mr Hunt's tax cut is widely seen as an attempt to claw back momentum ahead of an election this year - which Labour have said they expect as soon as May. Labour are expected to argue in response to any national insurance tax cut announcements that 'fiscal drag' - people being caught in frozen tax brackets - as well as increases to council tax would still leave the average household worse off. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said that his party would \"grow the economy to put more money in [people's] pocket\" if they gained power.

This is a tax-raising Conservative Government.\" It comes after Labour predicted that the election would be in May. Speaking to LBC's Andrew Marr on Tuesday evening, Shadow Health Secretary Wes Streeting said: \"All of the indicators point towards May. It should be May. \"I think people are fed up with the idea that Rishi Sunak, for his own personal survival and wanting to clock up two years as prime minister, will squat in Downing Street into the autumn when people are crying out for change.\" The election has to be held by January 28 next year at the very earliest, but it is likely to be this year. Mr Sunak has previously said he was working on the assumption the election would be in the autumn, but rumours have swirled in recent weeks that it could took place in May - in which case it would have to be called soon. Mr Hunt said \"lower tax means higher growth\" as he promised \"permanent cuts in taxation\" for families on the eve of his Budget. The Chancellor said Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's Government's plans \"mean more investment, more jobs, more productive public services and lower taxes\", and he accused Labour of having \"no plan\" and the Liberal Democrats of having \"no principles\". Mr Hunt's expected £10 billion tax cut would save 27 million workers an extra £450 a year. The chancellor also cut the rate in November's autumn statement. He will sell the move as a £900 overall tax cut to workers when combined with the two percentage point cut that was announced in November. The chancellor is poised to make national insurance a key measure in the spring Budget after deciding against cutting income tax.  Cutting income tax is much more expensive than reducing percentage points in employee National Insurance.

A cut of two percentage points in employee National Insurance costs around £10 billion a year, whilst cutting 2p in income tax would cost £3.7 billion more.  This tax break is expected to come in April, according to The Times - which has not been denied by Treasury sources.  The opposition party expects Mr Hunt to take its policy of ending non-dom status, which Labour said it would use to fund most of the spending in government, to partly fund the move. However, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has urged Mr Hunt to \"tread carefully\", and has warned of scrapping the tax status. This allows foreign nationals living in Britain to avoid paying tax on overseas earnings and by scrapping the scheme, Mr Hunt risks driving wealthy people out of the country. On Sunday, Mr Hunt said he is aiming to build on autumn’s reduction in national insurance contributions but will only cut taxes in a \"prudent, responsible and affordable way\". Speaking to LBC's Matthew Wright, Mr Hunt said his Budget was intended to help grow the economy in the long term, allowing for tax cuts later. \"Overall, I think what people want is not gimmicks, they want a long-term, responsible, sensible plan to grow the economy so we can bring down taxes and have enough money for public services in the future - and that's what I'll be delivering,\" he said. Mr Hunt continued to say his approach to cutting tax is \"very straightforward\". \"If you look around the world, the countries that are growing the fastest tend to be the ones with lower taxes,\" he said. \"We need to boost our growth... but I will only ever cut taxes in a way that is prudent, responsible and affordable.

      "With the Chancellor is set to announce the Budget on Wednesday, here’s everything to expect based on the predictions so far. \n",
      "Jeremy Hunt’s Budget preparations entered their final stages on Tuesday as he met with King Charles in a customary tradition to finalise the package.  Amid swirling speculation about what may or may not feature in the Budget, the Chancellor told LBC on Sunday that the it would be “prudent and responsible” to grow the economy in the long term and allow for tax cuts later. While some of the expected spending and cuts of Mr Hunt’s Budget appear all but confirmed, others remain more up in the air - so here is all the predictions about Wednesday's announcement. Read more: Jeremy Hunt 'to cut National Insurance by 2p' in Budget as tax boost for workers Read more: Royals return? King Charles meets Jeremy Hunt ahead of Budget after MoD said Kate will attend Trooping the Colour National Insurance One of the more likely results of the Chancellor’s Budget on Wednesday is a 2p cut to national insurance rates - after Mr Hunt already announced a cut to the rates last November. Reports say the £10 billion move would save 27 million workers an extra £450 a year. It is thought he will sell the move as a £900 overall tax cut to workers when combined with the two percentage point cut that was announced in November. Income tax The Chancellor has faced a barrage of calls from Tory MPs to cut income tax in the upcoming Spring Budget, however, government sources have suggested that national insurance is more likely to be slashed as it’s a cheaper way of cutting personal taxes. However, experts have warned that public spending cuts to fund such a move could see public services suffer as a result. Slashing income tax by just 1p would cost £7bn, according to the Resolution Foundation. Fuel duty Mr Hunt is expected to extend the fuel duty freeze for the 14th year in a row and a temporary 5p cut will be extended, Whitehall sources have suggested. Fuel prices rose dramatically in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and even rose by 4p a litre last month, though they remain significantly down from the peak sparked by the war. The Chancellor is reportedly scrambling to make tax cuts an affordable part of the Budget, the last before the next general election. Holiday lets crackdown Tax perks for holiday let owners are rumoured to be scrapped in Wednesday’s Budget. The move, which has been described as a ‘£300m raid on landlords’, is expected as part of the Chancellor’s plan to revive the rental markets in popular holiday destinations. It means holiday home owners in areas such as the Lake District could lose an average of £2,835 a year to make up for a high number of holiday lets which have seen reduced council tax revenue and less permanent accommodation availability in the affected destinations.  Vape tax New taxes on vaping appear likely in the Budget statement in a bid to help fund NI or income tax cuts. Such a move is likely to be accompanied by an increase in taxes on tobacco to ensure smoking remains more expensive. Scrapping non-dom status The Chancellor is reportedly looking at scrapping ‘non-dom’ status to fund tax cuts on Wednesday. Non-domicile status enables foreign nationals who live in the UK but are domiciled overseas to avoid paying UK tax on overseas income or capital gains for their first seven years in the country. Experts have warned that such a move could lead to a decline of investment in the UK, as those affected may be more inclined to move to other locations.  Stamp duty and inheritance tax Despite continued calls to cut stamp duty and inheritance tax, it appears unlikely that the Chancellor will announce any changes to these in Wednesday’s budget. Sources at Westminster have said a cut to inheritance tax has been ruled out but changes to it in the future could be part of the Conservatives’ election campaign manifesto. Mortgage 99% scheme Mr Hunt was reportedly drawing up plans for a 99% mortgage scheme, which would allow first-time buyers to put down a 1% deposit, according to the Financial Times. However, reports suggest this has since been scrapped following backlash from banks over the proposed move.  Lifetime ISA The Chancellor has hinted he could change up rules around the Lifetime Individual Savings Account (LISA) in another bid to help more people on the property ladder. When is the Spring Budget? The Spring Budget will be held on Wednesday 6 March. Typically, the Chancellor begins the statement at about 12:30pm - following the end of Prime Minister’s Questions.\n",

      "Volodymyr Zelenskyy hopes to \"finish the war this year\", in address to G7 countries to mark the third anniversary of Russia’s invasion.  The Ukrainian leader announced his ambition when asked about hopes for his country and people. This comes as the US abstained from voting on the UN Ukraine resolution on Monday. The resolution urged an end to the fighting in Ukraine, but the US wanted to change the resolution to leave out mention of Russian aggression. Trump's administration put their version of the resolution to the UN on Friday, pitting it against Ukraine the EU allies who have spent weeks negotiating their own resolution.   The UN meeting comes amid ever-rising tensions in Europe, with the US seemingly abandoning its support for Zelenskyy’s embattled country. Sir Keir Starmer has pledged his support for Ukraine “today and every day” as he spoke with Zelenskyy today. The Prime Minister reaffirmed that Britain is ready to commit British troops on the ground in Ukraine in order to maintain peace. \"I have a very simple, clear message today, the UK is with you today and every day, from His Majesty the King to the NHS workers volunteering in hospitals in Ukraine to the communities that took Ukrainian refugees to their heart,” the PM said. Hitting back at comments made by President Trump that Ukraine has “no cards left to play”, Starmer said: “Russia does not hold all the cards in this war.

And Ukraine must be included in peace talks, Starmer said, a stark contrast to President Trump’s disregard for Zelenskyy. He said: “If we want peace to endure, Ukraine must have a seat at the table. “And any settlement must be based on a sovereign Ukraine.\"\n",

That is why we will always stand with Ukraine, and with our allies.” It comes as Volodymyr Zelenskyy praised the \"absolute heroism\" of the Ukrainian people as his country marks the third anniversary of Russia's invasion. The Ukrainian president thanked \"everyone who defends and supports\" Ukraine, in a war that has killed tens of thousands of people on both sides. In an early morning statement on Monday, Mr Zelenskyy said: \"Three years of resistance. Three years of gratitude. Three years of absolute heroism of Ukrainians. I am proud of Ukraine! I thank everyone who defends and supports it. Everyone who works for Ukraine. \"And may the memory of all those who gave their lives for our state and people be eternal.\" On Sunday evening, Starmer and the head of Nato agreed there could be \"no negotiations about Ukraine without Ukraine\" in a call, Number 10 said. A Downing Street spokesperson said: \"The Prime Minister spoke with Nato secretary-general Mark Rutte this evening. \"Ahead of the three-year anniversary of Russia's barbaric full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the Prime Minister began by underscoring that Ukraine must be in the strongest position possible. \"The leaders agreed that there could be no negotiations about Ukraine without Ukraine. They agreed it was important for Europe to step up in order to ensure European security. \"The Prime Minister said he would continue to have these vital discussions with international partners, including during his visit to Washington DC. \"They agreed to speak soon.\" Meanwhile Starmer and France's president Emmanuel Macron are both set to meet with Mr Trump this week, and have agreed to present a united front to the US. A Downing Street spokesperson said: \"The Prime Minister spoke with President Macron this afternoon. \"They began by discussing the third anniversary of Russia's barbaric full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which is a stark reminder that we must all work together to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position at this crucial moment for global security. \"The Prime Minister repeated the UK's steadfast commitment to support Ukraine for as long as needed and reiterated the importance of Ukraine being at the centre of any negotiations to end the conflict. \"The UK and Europe must continue stepping up to meet their security needs and show united leadership in support of Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression, which they would both discuss in the US in the coming week. \"The leaders agreed to stay in close contact.\"\n",

      "Boris Johnson has hit out at comments blaming Ukraine for the Russian invasion but has told LBC he thinks a deal will be struck between Zelensky and Trump this week.\n",
      "Speaking in Kyiv on the third anniversary of the Russian invasion, former Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the language around Ukraine is responsible for the war was \"emetic,\" he said \"you might as well say that the swimmers were responsible for attacking the shark in Jaws or the United States were responsible for attacking Japan at Pearl Harbor.\" It comes as Europe reels from the US president blaming Ukraine for the war and criticising the country's leader, Volodymyr Zelensky, for complaining that Kyiv has been excluded from negotiations about its own future. Trump made remarks implying that Ukraine \"should have never started it\" and criticized Zelensky's wartime leadership, calling him a \"dictator\" and accusing him of failing to hold elections due to martial law, which is prohibited under Ukraine's constitution during wartime. Asked for his response to Mr Trump's assertion that Ukraine \"started it\", Mr Johnson branded the claims \"Orwellian\" and a \"complete inversion of the truth.\" Mr Trump said he was \"disappointed\" that Mr Zelensky had complained about being left out of talks and suggested Kyiv should have been willing to make concessions to Moscow. \"You should have never started it. You could have made a deal,\" the US president said on Tuesday. Read more: Kremlin linked elites 'stopped from visiting UK' with new sanctions on third anniversary of Russian invasion of Ukraine Read more: On the anniversary of Russia’s invasion, I met the British troops preparing to defend Europe However, Mr Johnson said if you look at the text of an agreement on the table between Ukraine and the USA it was \"very promising\"  The former PM revealed he thought the deal would be signed between the two countries \"this week.\" Responding at a press conference on Wednesday, Mr Zelensky said Mr Trump is living in a \"disinformation space\" created by the Kremlin, which has repeatedly sought to blame Kyiv for the war. \"I am protecting Ukraine, I can't sell it away, I can't sell our state,\" he told reporters in Kyiv on Wednesday. \"With all due respect to President Donald Trump, as the leader of a nation that we respect greatly... (he) is living in this disinformation space.\" Mr Trump then responded on social media by branding the Ukrainian president \"a modestly successful comedian and a \"dictator without elections\". Mr Trump wrote: \"I love Ukraine, but Zelenskyy has done a terrible job, his Country is shattered, and millions have unnecessarily died - And so it continues...\" Sir Keir Starmer earlier this week urged Mr Trump to provide a \"backstop\" to any settlement between Kyiv and Moscow, and on a visit to Washington next week he is expected to make the case for US security guarantees on any peace deal. The Prime Minister has committed to consider sending peacekeeping troops to Ukraine, but Mr Trump said on Tuesday that the US would not \"have to\" deploy soldiers to monitor a possible ceasefire. Former prime minister Boris Johnson, who was in office when the war began, claimed Mr Trump's statements are \"not intended to be historically accurate but to shock Europeans into action\". He asked when Europeans will \"stop being scandalised about Donald Trump and start helping him to end this war?\" In a message posted on X, Mr Johnson said: \"Of course Ukraine didn't start the war. You might as well say that America attacked Japan at Pearl Harbor. \"Of course a country undergoing a violent invasion should not be staging elections. There was no general election in the UK from 1935 to 1945. \"Of course Zelensky's ratings are not 4%. They are actually about the same as Trump's.\" Mr Johnson later added: \"The US believes Belgium, France and other countries are blocking. It's absurd. We need to get serious and fast.\" Washington and Moscow started talks earlier this week to broker a peace in Ukraine, led by US secretary of state Marco Rubio and Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov. Ukraine was not invited to the negotiations, which took place in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and concluded with ground rules for further diplomacy. European countries were also locked out of the talks. Sir Ben Wallace - who was defence secretary under Mr Johnson - suggested the talks may have been a waste of time. He posted on X: \"I think what President Trump is learning is that if you have no skin in the game you don't get to decide the fate of Ukraine. I am sure they all enjoyed their 4 hour talks today but they probably shouldn't have wasted their time.\" Sir John Whittingdale, who sits on the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, described Mr Trump's comments as \"very disappointing and extremely worrying\". The Conservative former minister told the PA news agency: \"They portray such a complete misunderstanding of how this war came about and if that is the stance he is going to take in the negotiations taking place with Putin then I'm filled with anxiety that this may result in a complete sellout of Ukraine. \"If that is his position going forward into those talks, then he's already conceded to Putin half of what Putin wants.\"\n",

      "Sir Keir Starmer is expected to join world leaders in a call hosted by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Monday to mark the third anniversary of Russia's invasion. The Prime Minister reiterated Britain's \"ironclad\" backing for Kyiv in a series of conversations with allies over the weekend as he prepares to make the case for safeguards to protect the country's sovereignty on his visit to the US this week. On Monday, which marks three years since Moscow's full-scale invasion, he is expected to address leaders from the G7 and across Europe as part of a group call in a show of solidarity amid fragile transatlantic relations. Read more: Zelenskyy willing to step down as Ukraine's president 'immediately' if it 'brings peace or Nato membership' Read more: Russia launches 'aerial terror' on Ukraine, with the biggest drone attack of the war so far Meanwhile, the Home Office announced a move to widen travel sanctions for Kremlin-linked elites in a bid to heap more pressure on Russia as the war enters its fourth year. Local and federal politicians as well as managers or directors of large Russian companies will face a ban on entering the UK under the rules, which come on top of existing measures preventing high-profile business figures such as Roman Abramovich from staying in Britain. Security minister Dan Jarvis told LBC's Nick Ferrari at Breakfast the government were \"stopping elites coming from Russia to the United Kingdom in the way they've been able to for some time, these are people who are materially linked to Putin's regime, who've extracted significant wealth and resource from the Russian state.\"  He told Nick: \"We've expanded the criteria for exclusion which now will give the home secretary the discretionary power to stop those people from travelling to the UK\". The Prime Minister will seek to position the UK as a bridge between Europe and America on his visit next week as tensions simmer after Mr Trump hit out at Mr Zelensky and White House officials met Kremlin counterparts to discuss ending the war. Earlier on Sunday, Number 10 said Sir Keir had agreed with French President Emmanuel Macron, who will meet the US president in Washington days before the Prime Minister, on the need to show \"united leadership\" in support of Kyiv. Elsewhere, he held a call with his Canadian counterpart Justin Trudeau, who is set to chair the joint call on Monday morning, with whom he agreed \"working together alongside other international leaders was essential to achieve lasting peace and security in Ukraine,\" Number 10 said. The Prime Minister held his second call in three days with the Ukrainian president on Sunday, promising he would be \"progressing important discussions\" about Kyiv's security on his visit to Washington. He reiterated that Ukraine must be at the heart of any negotiations to end the war and that safeguarding its sovereignty was essential to deter future aggression from Russia. Sir Keir's visit will mark a critical moment in his leadership after Mr Trump called Mr Zelensky a \"dictator\" and suggested Kyiv had \"started\" the war. The Ukrainian leader later accused Mr Trump of living in a \"disinformation space\" after US-Kremlin talks about bringing the conflict to an end, at which neither Kyiv nor other European countries were present. On Sunday, Mr Zelensky said he would be ready to give up his presidency if doing so would achieve lasting peace for his country under the security umbrella of Nato, which the US has suggested is an unrealistic prospect. Some European leaders and opposition figures have openly condemned Mr Trump's remarks about Ukraine and Sir Keir has faced pressure to challenge the president when he visits Washington. The Prime Minister has backed Mr Zelensky as a \"democratically elected leader\", but avoided directly criticising the US president. At the weekend, Sir Keir and his Cabinet warned that a weak peace deal would cause damage far beyond Ukraine, saying that including a US security guarantee to deter Russia from attacking again is in Washington's own interest. Speaking at the Scottish Labour conference in Glasgow on Sunday, the Prime Minister said: \"Nobody wants the bloodshed to continue, least of all the Ukrainians. \"But after everything that they have suffered, after everything they have fought for, there can be no discussion about Ukraine without Ukraine, and the people of Ukraine must have a long-term, secure future.\" Sir Keir is also facing pressure to use the trip to confirm a timeline to raise UK defence spending to 2.5% of national income amid US demands that Europe shoulder the overwhelming burden of security on the continent. Ministers had previously suggested a path towards reaching the target would be set out in the spring following the strategic defence review. Mr Trump used a wide-ranging speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (Cpac) in Washington on Saturday to say \"we're pretty close to a deal\". \"We better be close to a deal because that has been a horrible situation,\" he added. Mr Zelensky has said his country will not accept any outcome from talks between Moscow and Washington because Kyiv was excluded from the discussions.\n",

Sir Mark Lyall told LBC's Nick Ferrari at Breakfast: \"People are dying absolutely every day, a mixture of First World War trench warfare at the front but some very high-tech drone warfare, missile warfare going on beyond the backlines.  \"We shouldn't forget quite how terrible this war is three years on, happening right on the edge of Europe\". Kurt Volker, a former US ambassador to NATO, told Nick that Mr Trump was probably \"frustrated\" by Mr Zelenskyy. He said: \"I think Trump's real interest is simply ending this war so he doesn't have to think about it anymore, he doesn't really have a sense of what a just outcome should be.  \"If Zelenskyy appears to be making it difficult to get an outcome because he wants a more just outcome, that'll be frustrating for Trump\". Separately, the Home Office announced a move to widen travel sanctions for Kremlin-linked elites in a bid to heap more pressure on Russia. Local and federal politicians as well as managers or directors of large Russian companies will face exclusion from the UK under the rules, which come on top of existing travel bans on high-profile business figures such as Roman Abramovich. Security minister Dan Jarvis said the expanded criteria for sanctions would \"slam the door shut to the oligarchs who have enriched themselves at the expense of the Russian people whilst bankrolling\" the war. \"My message to Putin's friends in Moscow is simple: you are not welcome in the UK,\" he said. He later told Nick: \"We are stopping elites coming from Russia to the United Kingdom in the way they've been able to for some time, these are people who are materially linked to Putin's regime, who've extracted significant wealth and resource from the Russian state.  \"We've expanded the criteria for exclusion which now will give the home secretary the discretionary power to stop those people from travelling to the UK\".\n",

      "President Zelenskyy has offered to step down \"immediately\" as Ukraine's leader \"if it brings peace\" or allows the nation to gain Nato membership.\n",
      "Speaking in a press conference on Sunday, Ukraine's president said: “I am ready to step down if it brings peace. Or trade it for Nato.” He added it was “not enough” for Donald Trump to act as a mediator between Russia and Ukraine, with the country looking for lasting peace with its neighbours. “I want very much from Trump understanding of each other,” he told a press conference. He added: “Security guarantees from Trump are much needed.\" Zelenskyy said that he was focused on Ukraine's security, and it is not his \"dream\" to remain president for a decade. It comes days before the third-year anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, on 24 February 2022. Reports have emerged that Ukraine may be forced to hold elections as part of a peace negotiation with Russia, according to the Telegraph.  Russia have repeatedly stated that they will not agree to a peace agreement if they are granted Nato membership.  Pete Hegseth, the US defence secretary, said that Ukraine possible Nato membership would be unlikely to be part of the negotiations. Speaking on Sunday, Zelensky added that he was \"not offended\" by \"dictator\" comments made by Trump earlier this week. \"I wouldn’t call Donald Trump’s words a compliment,” the Ukrainian president said. He added: “I wasn’t offended, but a dictator would be.”“I’m not. I’m the legally elected president.” This comes as Russia launched its biggest drone attack on Ukraine, since the war started, this week. President Zelenskyy said on X that Russia has launched an \"aerial terror\" on Ukraine, as more than 250 drones attack the country overnight. He wrote: \"Every day, our people stand against aerial terror,\" \"On the eve of the third anniversary of the full-scale war, Russia launched 267 attack drones against Ukraine - the largest attack since Iranian drones began striking Ukrainian cities and villages.\" Ukraine's airforce said that 138 drones were downed and another 119 disappeared from radars after being immobilised by their electronic warfare. The attack was reported over five regions of Ukraine. Tensions between Washington and Kyiv have heightened in the last week, after Trump branded Zelenskyy as a 'dictator' and the Ukrainian leader stalled signing a 'problematic' minerals deal with the US - in exchange for weapons. According to a source close to the negotiations, there were a \"number of problematic issues\" with the draft agreement. It comes as Donald Trump continues to criticise the Ukrainian leader - despite also claiming in recent hours that a minerals deal was close. He also blasted European leaders including Starmer and Macron, saying they had \"done nothing\" to avert conflict with Russia. Trump's ex-security advisor has called Donald Trump a \"useful idiot\" to Putin, as he told LBC the US President's desire to run for a third term in office are being taken serious by insiders. He said: \"I have to say, even I was surprised that the near 180-degree U-turn on Ukraine, where the US has really all but surrendered key elements of Ukraine's position and what had been the position of the United States and the NATO alliance - even before talks with the Russians began.\" \"I don't see that improving over the near term,\" he admitted. Asked why relations between Zelenskyy and Trump had descended into what is effectively a sharp exchange of insults, Bolton said it stemmed back to the \"perfect\" phone call between the leader and Trump in the summer of 2019. Bolton described how Trump \"essentially threatened to withhold security assistance to Ukraine if Zelensky didn't cooperate in Trump's political desire to find the famous Hillary Clinton computer server and uncover what he saw were Ukrainian actions in the 2016 election in favour of Clinton, and against him, that obviously led to the first impeachment.\" \"Despite Zelensky's recent efforts to try to create a better relationship with Trump, that's obviously failed. And then, of course, on the other side, Trump thinks Vladimir Putin is his friend.\" \"Trump certainly performs as a useful idiot in advancing what Putin and the Russians seem to want,\" he added.\n",

Donald Trump has said Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy need to ‘work together’. Speaking at the swearing in of his new commerce secretary, Mr Trump also said Russia ‘wants to do a deal’.  Trump denied reports that he is planning to visit Moscow. Trump also put pressure on the Ukrainian leader to sign a deal trading Ukrainian minerals for US weapons.

And it needs strong security guarantees so the peace will last. \"I believe America must be part of that guarantee,\" Starmer continued in a column for The Sun,  \"It’s in their interest. A peace deal which does not stop Putin from attacking again would be a disaster for everyone. \"The best way to make sure that doesn’t happen is to be firm and fair now.\" As part of his bid to woo the US President, it is expected Sir Keir will pledge greater UK defence spending and could also invite Mr Trump on a state visit to Balmoral Education Secretary, Bridget Phillipson, told Lewis Goodall on Sunday that the Prime Minister wants to build the \"special relationship\" between the US and the UK. \"I think clearly we will seek to work with the US government as much as we possibly can. We clearly come at it from different political viewpoints. President Trump has reflected and understood that. He regards the Prime Minister as someone that he can work with,\" she said. \"They've had a very warm, open relationship in terms of the initial conversations that they have had. But of course, we have different political standpoints, different political viewpoints. That's not a secret.\" She added: \"We want to make sure as a nation that Ukraine is in the strongest possible position going into any negotiated settlement\". \"That’s why I’m also open to British troops playing a role in any European force in Ukraine after a peace agreement. This is not something I say lightly,\" he added. The PM also warned that Russia remains a threat to our security here in Britain. The Salisbury Novichok attack in 2018, planes intruding out airspace, and bots invading our social media sites were all examples Starmer offered. Writing on recent economic instability, he continued: \"The cost-of-living crisis that has hammered working people has a clear link to instability in Ukraine. \"But unless Ukraine is properly protected from Putin’s tyranny, then I’m afraid Europe will only become more unstable. That can only hurt us. \"Britain can be proud of how it has stood by Ukraine. Successive Governments have been robust in our defence of democracy and freedom.\" This comes as the UK will unveil new sanctions to \"turn the screws\" on Russia as it marks three years since Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. The Foreign Secretary said he would announce the sanctions, which he called the largest package of measures since the early days of the conflict, on Monday to coincide with the anniversary. David Lammy said they aim to hit the country's revenues and hamper Vladimir Putin's \"military machine\". He added the UK would continue to work with US and European partners to achieve \"sustainable, just peace\", but stressed that Ukraine must be involved. The US has started negotiations on ending the conflict with Russia, but excluded Kyiv from the talks, sparking outrage across Europe. Sir Keir Starmer will have to walk a tricky line when he meets Trump in Washington next week, balancing the UK's support for Ukraine with the need to keep the US onside. President Zelenskyy said on Saturday he is not prepared to sign a mineral deal with the US, according to a source close to the negotiations, noting he sees a \"number of problematic issues\" with the draft agreement. Donald Trump criticised the Ukrainian leader - despite also claiming that a minerals deal was close. The proposed agreement would see Ukraine trade the country's natural resources in exchange for US weapons. \"The agreement is not yet ready to be signed, there are a number of problematic issues, and in the current form of the draft, the president is not ready to accept it,\" a Ukrainian source told Sky News. \"Today, the drafts do not reflect a partnership in the agreement and contain only unilateral commitments by Ukraine.\"\n",

      "Ukraine has “no cards left to play” in negotiations with Russia, Donald Trump has said as he hit out Sir Keir Starmer for “doing nothing” to end Russia’s war. \n",
      "\n",
      "As tensions continue to rise between the United States and Ukraine, President Donald Trump has said Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s presence at peace negotiations is “not very important.” It comes just hours after the US held \"extensive and positive\" talks with President Zelenskyy, according to Trump’s envoy for war. \"I've been watching for years, and I've been watching him negotiate with no cards,” Trump told Fox News on Friday. “He has no cards. And you get sick of it. You just get sick of it. And I've had it,\" he added.

So, I don't think it's very important to be at meetings, to be honest with you. He makes it very hard to make deals.\" Trump went on to hit out at European leaders, including Sir Keir Starmer, for failing to end the war. He described the British PM as a \"nice guy\" but said Putin has only come to the table \"because of me\". These comments come after the US envoy for war, Keith Kellogg, held \"extensive and positive\" talks with Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Taking to X, he said: \"A long and intense day with the senior leadership of Ukraine. \"Extensive and positive discussions with [Zelenskyy], the embattled and courageous leader of a nation at war and his talented national security team.\" Despite Kellogg’s positive comments, Trump and his billionaire ally Elon Musk continue to attack the Ukrainian leader. A chainsaw-wielding Elon Musk accused Zelenskyy of running a 'fraud machine feeding off dead soldiers' in a fresh attack on the Ukrainian leader. It comes after the White House revealed that Donald Trump was \"very frustrated\" with Zelenskyy and had a \"personal\" problem with him. Musk reiterated calls for the Ukrainian president to hold an election but claimed he wouldn't because \"he knows he would lose in a landslide\". Writing on X, Musk said: \"In reality, he is despised by the people of Ukraine, which is why he has refused to hold an election. I challenge Zelenskyy to hold an election and refute this. He will not.\" He added: \"President Trump is right to ignore him and solve for peace independent of the disgusting, massive graft machine feeding off the dead bodies of Ukrainian soldiers.\" Earlier this week, Trump described Zelenskyy as a dictator in a furious social media rant. In his TruthSocial post, Trump wrote: \"Think of it, a modestly successful comedian, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, talked the United States of America into spending $350 Billion Dollars, to go into a War that couldn’t be won, that never had to start, but a War that he, without the U.S. and “TRUMP,” will never be able to settle. \"The United States has spent $200 Billion Dollars more than Europe, and Europe’s money is guaranteed, while the United States will get nothing back. \"Why didn’t Sleepy Joe Biden demand Equalization, in that this War is far more important to Europe than it is to us — We have a big, beautiful Ocean as separation.\" He added: \"A Dictator without Elections, Zelenskyy better move fast or he is not going to have a Country left. \"In the meantime, we are successfully negotiating an end to the War with Russia, something all admit only “TRUMP,” and the Trump Administration, can do.\" Zelenskyy has accused President Trump of being \"trapped in a disinformation bubble\" after he accused the Ukrainian leader of starting the war.\n",

      "Speaking at the G20 summit in South Africa on Thursday, Wang Yi told the media that China \"supports\" US-Russia negotiations, adding it will \"continue playing a constructive role\" in talks. It comes as Donald Trump denounced President Zelenskiy as a \"dictator\" on Wednesday, before the US cancelled a joint press conference. The comments prompted a tit-for-tat exchange between the US and Ukraine, with Europe coming out in support for the Ukrainian president - including from G20 members including Germany and the United Kingdom. Speaking on Thursday, Mr Yi said: “China supports all efforts conducive to peace (in Ukraine), including the recent consensus reached between the United States and Russia. “China is willing to continue playing a constructive role in the political resolution of the crisis.\" China has long been aligned with Russia on a host of matters - most notably, trading, which saw relations between the two hit a record high in 2024. Mr Yin's comments follow a meeting between US and Russian officials in Saudi Arabia last week - a meeting that failed to provide Ukraine with a seat at the table.

It marks the third anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion, with figures including to Ursula von der Leyen, European Commission president, travelling to the country. Discussions between the countries have raised fears any truce would likely favour Moscow. It comes as Zelenskyy continues to insist that Ukraine will not agree to a peace deal unless they have a hand in ceasefire negotiations. The Prime Minister showed support for the \"democratically elected\" President of Ukraine this week following Trump's comments. The US president took aim at Zelenskyy after he accused Trump of \"helping Putin to come out of isolation\" by working with him. On Wednesday evening, Number Ten released a statement expressing Starmer's support for the Ukrainian leader following a phone call. In the call, the Prime Minister said it was \"perfectly reasonable to suspend elections during war time as the UK did during World War Two\", according to a Downing Street spokesperson.

      "The Kremlin has hit back at proposals put forward by Sir Keir Starmer to send 30,000 troops to Ukraine, branding the plan \"unacceptable\".\n",
      "Speaking on Thursday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia would not accept such involvement, given the plan would involve NATO member forces on the ground. \"The idea of deploying troops from NATO countries to Ukraine is unacceptable for Russia,\" Peskov said, adding the move would have major ramifications for Russia's own security. It follows Sir Keir Starmer's proposal to send around 30,000 European troops to Ukraine as part of his peacekeeping effort. It's thought the Prime Minister will present his plan to Donald Trump in a bid to secure American protection for the deployment, it is understood. He has said a \"US backstop\" is needed to deter Russia from another attack.

The strategy for a \"reassurance force\" was put forward during an emergency meeting in Paris this week. Details of the Anglo-French plan are yet to be fully revealed but are understood to include putting troops in major cities away from the front line. There will be a focus on \"technical monitoring\" to ensure that Russia does not invade again, a source told the Telegraph. They said the operation would be backed by enough firepower to \"monitor and shoot those attacks down\". Other key areas will include Ukraine's air and maritime spaces, with troops set to be sent to major seaports and stations. A larger force could also be based on Nato's eastern borders to move in if necessary. \"The reason why it’s not a peacekeeping or peace enforcement or a deterrence force is the assumption that the backstop, the ceasefire, the litigations, have given you the foundation for something that might be lighter in its construct,” a Western official said. The plan falls short of the 200,000-troops Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has called for as a potential price for the peace deal. There is also opposition from Germany, Spain and Italy when it comes to sending troops to Ukraine. \"The purpose of the backstop would be to have the confidence that whatever forces are deployed will not be challenged by Russia,\" a source said. Sir Keir previously addressed the need for a security guarantee to deter Russia. He said he believes the UK can play a crucial role in peace negotiations, bridging the gap between the US and Europe. If the US signs up to the backstop, it will mean no US troops will be deployed to Ukraine after the war. It comes after a war of words broke out between Mr Trump and Mr Zelenskyy on Wednesday. Mr Trump branded Mr Zelenskyy as a “comedian” and “dictator” in a furious TruthSocial post. He hit out after the Ukrainian leader accused him of \"helping Putin to come out of isolation\" by working with him.\n",

      "The Prime Minister has shown support for the \"democratically elected\" President of Ukraine following comments made by Donald Trump.\n",
      "The US president took aim at Zelenskyy after he accused Trump of \"helping Putin to come out of isolation\" by working with him. On Wednesday evening, Number Ten released a statement expressing Starmer's support for the Ukrainian leader following a phone call. In the call, the Prime Minister said it was \"perfectly reasonable to suspend elections during war time as the UK did during World War Two\", according to a Downing Street spokesperson. A Downing Street spokesperson said: “The Prime Minister spoke to President Zelenskyy this evening and stressed the need for everyone to work together. “The Prime Minister expressed his support for President Zelenskyy as Ukraine’s democratically elected leader and said that it was perfectly reasonable to suspend elections during war time as the UK did during World War II. Mr Zelensky, who was elected as president of Ukraine in May 2019, postponed elections which were previously scheduled to go ahead in 2024 after martial law was put in place across the country. “The Prime Minister reiterated his support for the US-led efforts to get a lasting peace in Ukraine that deterred Russia from any future aggression.” Trump took to TruthSocial on Wednesday to demand the US be paid back the billions it spent on Ukraine and call for Zelenskyy to hold elections or he \"may not have a country left.\" It comes as the US and Russia hold peace talks without Ukraine, leading many to believe the Trump administration has abandoned Europe to Putin and Russia. Read more: Trump is living in a ‘disinformation space’, says Zelenskyy as he hits back at US for ‘helping’ Putin 'come out of isolation' In the post, Trump wrote: \"Think of it, a modestly successful comedian, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, talked the United States of America into spending $350 Billion Dollars, to go into a War that couldn’t be won, that never had to start, but a War that he, without the U.S. and “TRUMP,” will never be able to settle. \"The United States has spent $200 Billion Dollars more than Europe, and Europe’s money is guaranteed, while the United States will get nothing back. \"Why didn’t Sleepy Joe Biden demand Equalization, in that this War is far more important to Europe than it is to us — We have a big, beautiful Ocean as separation.\" He added: \"A Dictator without Elections, Zelenskyy better move fast or he is not going to have a Country left. \"In the meantime, we are successfully negotiating an end to the War with Russia, something all admit only “TRUMP,” and the Trump Administration, can do.\" Zelenskyy has accused President Trump of being \"trapped in a disinformation bubble\" after he accused the Ukrainian leader of starting the war. Speaking in a news conference, Zelenskyy said he is \"seeing a lot of disinformation\" from Russia. He's also accused Trump is 'helping' Putin 'to come out of isolation' by working with him. He said: \"With all due respect to President Donald Trump as a leader, he is living in this disinformation space.\" The Ukrainian leader added: \"Look, we all want a victory, and we want Trump to win, and we want Ukraine to win, all of us to succeed. \"But I am protecting Ukraine. I can't sell it away. I can't sell our state.\" He also dismissed suggestions that he should step down as leader, or that his approval ratings are at 4%. The Ukrainian leader said that it was Russian disinformation - his approval ratings are actually 50%. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch as rejected Trump's claim that Zelenskyy is a dictator in a rare break from the Republican's position.  She wrote on X: \"President Zelenskyy is not a dictator. He is the democratically elected leader of Ukraine who bravely stood up to Putin’s illegal invasion. \"Under my leadership, and under successive Conservative Prime Ministers, we have and always will stand with Ukraine. \"President Trump is right that Europe needs to pull its weight - and that includes the UK. We need to get serious. The PM will have my support to increase defence spending - there is a fully funded plan to get to 2.5% sitting on his desk. \"That should be the bare minimum. Starmer should get on with it, get on a plane to Washington and show some leadership. We cannot afford to get this wrong.\" It comes after Trump made the false claim that Ukraine started the war, which began when Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 and escalated after Putin invaded the country in 2022.  \"Today I heard, ‘oh, well, we weren’t invited.’ Well, you’ve been there for three years ... You should have never started it. You could have made a deal,” Trump said. Thousands of Russian soldiers have barrelled over the Kursk border into Ukraine, Vladimir Putin has claimed, despite insisting he is willing to explore options to ending the war. Russia’s alleged advance came just hours after Moscow stressed Putin’s willingness to enter peace talks with Zelenskyy. Kremlin spokesman Dmirty Peskov told reporters on Tuesday the Russian leader has “repeatedly said he is ready to speak about peace” but stressed that Moscow's “wider security issues” need to be addressed first.\n",

      "Mayor of London Sir Sadiq Khan has hit out at Donald Trump for 'rewarding' Vladimir Putin while excluding Ukraine from peace talks.\n",
      "Speaking during LBC's Speak to Sadiq, he said \"what happens in Ukraine happens to us\", as he warned that Trump was \"rewarding\" Putin. He said it was \"bonkers\" that President Zelenskyy's team had not been included in talks to end the war in Ukraine. \"We have tens of thousands of Ukrainians who are refugees in our city because of Putin's illegal invasion of Ukraine,\" the mayor said.  \"And what beggars belief is for the president of the USA apparently rewarding the aggressor, not just in terms of giving him the 20% of Ukraine that they currently occupy, but also somehow blaming President Zelenskyy for what's happened over the last few years.\" Read more: Trump is living in a ‘disinformation space’, says Zelenskyy as he hits back at US for ‘helping’ Putin 'come out of isolation' Read more: Ukraine 'could partner with Europe' if sidelined from negotiations - as Ben Wallace brands Trump remarks 'pure Disney' He went on to say: \"When you hear the stories of those who've lost their lives, those who are bereaved, those who are amputees, the suffering in Kyiv and across Ukraine, and somehow blame the Ukrainian leadership is beggars belief.  \"But also the idea that you'd have Putin's team and Trump's team having conversations about Ukraine's future without President Zelenskyy or Ukrainian people is just bonkers.\" Sir Sadiq said he spent Tuesday with the mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, who is trying to get across the suffering still going on. \"One of the reasons he's here is to make sure we remind ourselves of what's happening in Kyiv and Ukraine,\" he said.  \"Vitali is somebody who knows Donald Trump from his days as a boxer. Both him and Vladimir, his brother, were world champions, and he's really keen to get across the suffering that's still taking place, the loss that's taken place over the last three years.  \"But also, there can be no solution [without including the] Ukrainian people and the Ukrainian leadership.\" It comes after Zelenskyy said Trump is living in a Russian \"disinformation space\", following the US president's comments about the Ukrainian leader's approval rating. Trump said at his Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago, on Tuesday that Zelenskyy's rating stands at 4%.  \t The Ukrainian president replied at a news conference in the capital, Kyiv, on Wednesday: \"We have seen this disinformation. We understand that it is coming from Russia.\"  \t He added that Trump \"lives in this disinformation space\". The US president also suggested that Ukraine ought to hold elections, which have been postponed due to the war and the consequent imposition of martial law, in accordance with the Ukrainian Constitution.  \t Public opinion polls and approval ratings have not been reliable in Ukraine because of the fighting.  \t Zelenskyy made the comments shortly before he was expected to meet Keith Kellogg, the US special envoy for Ukraine and Russia. Kellogg will meet Zelenskyy and military commanders as the US shifts its policy away from years of efforts to isolate Putin.  \t Trump suggested on Tuesday that Kyiv was to blame for the war, which enters its fourth year next week, as talks between top American and Russian diplomats in Saudi Arabia sidelined Ukraine and its European supporters.  \t The US president's comments angered Ukrainian officials, who are still urging the world to help them fight Russia's full-scale invasion that began on February 24, 2022.\n",

      "Former Defence Secretary, Sir Ben Wallace, has told LBC that Ukraine must have a seat at the negotiating table for peace talks to work.\n",
      "Speaking with Nick Ferrari on Wednesday, Wallace touched on the idea of Ukraine partnering with Europe and the UK if sidelined from US-led negotiations with Russia, adding: \"What does Zelenskyy have to lose?\" Wallace said: \"Fundamentally if you want to get a peace deal in Ukraine, you need the people who have skin in the game to make it happen.\" President Trump has recently suggested that President Zelenskyy is responsible for the Russian invasion, as he said \"you should've never started it, you could've made a deal\". He also claimed that the war could have been \"settled very easily\" if he were in charge of negotiations with \"no people killed and no city demolished\". Russia met with US representatives in Saudi Arabia for peace negotiations this week. Reacting to Trump's, Wallace said: \"I know Mar-a-Lago is quite close to Disneyworld, but that was pure Disney in facts.\" Read More: Senior Tories blast 'out of touch' judge for 'ludicrous attack' on Starmer’s migrant remarks Read More: BBC blasted for 'blindly spouting propaganda' over claims Gaza documentary features Hamas leader's son Wallace told LBC that Zelenskyy could easily partner with Europe and the UK for peace negotiations, and bypass the Russia-US talks altogether. He said that until Russia and Ukraine speak together, negotiations cannot meaningfully move forward. Wallace also pointed out that Europe has given more funding to Ukraine, in combination, than the United States. The former defence secretary pointed out that these comments but Trump will 'make the Kremlin very happy', as it blames Ukraine for the dragging peace negotiations.  Trump has suggested that Ukrainians should elect a new leader if they want lasting peace. Wallace told Nick: 'Winston Churchill didn't have an election for six years because we were fighting the second world war. It didn't make us undemocratic. We were fighting for our survival. \"No doubt the constitution of Ukraine will be upheld and they'll have an election as soon as possible.\" He noted that Ukraine is a small and ill-equipped force compared to the Russians, but Zelenskyy's army have managed to defend themselves. Wallace said that the UK must push defence up the agenda. He maintained that, fundamentally, Prime Minister Keir Starmer is doing the right thing. Starmer is preparing to meet with Trump, and said he was prepared to put British troops into Ukraine if needed. Wallace said that the 'roadmap' Starmer has set out to a 2.5% GDP defence budget is not enough.  He said: \"We have not got a good enough armed forces at the moment.\" Wallace \"fears for the integrity of NATO\" if we do not properly equip ourselves to defend Europe. He added: \"We need to put our money where our mouth is.\" Defending Trump, Wallace said that we must not take the US's contributions to NATO for granted. He added that the US may be cautious working with European nations as they are not \"properly equipped, armed and funded\". Wallace said that Starmer's Washington visit gives the UK the opportunity to be firm with the US. He said that Starmer has yet to challenge the US president on matters regarding Ukraine, Greenland potential annexation (as we are Denmark's close ally) and incoming tariffs. Wallace said: \"We should focus on Britain's national interest.\" \n",

Trump's comments follow a long day of talks, with the first high-level, face-to-face conversations taking place between US and Russian officials in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday. It's the first peace negotiations to take place since the war began, with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressing concerns about his exclusion from talks. Trump spoke with reporters from Florida late on Tuesday, expressing that he was “disappointed” that the Ukrainian leader felt he was left out of negotiations, telling reporters “I’m very disappointed, I hear that they’re upset about not having a seat [at the talks],” Trump told reporters from his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.

On Tuesday, Zelenskyy met with Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan. \"We want no one to decide anything behind our backs … No decision can be made without Ukraine on how to end the war in Ukraine,\" Zelenskyy told reporters. It follows Zelenskyy postponing his visit to Saudi Arabia, which was meant to take place on Wednesday, until 10 March. It follows initial high level talks between Russia and the US in Saudi Arabia yesterday. Zelenskyy insisted Europe should also have a seat at the table during any peace talks to end to the war in Ukraine. During the press conference, Erdogan reiterated that Turkey's \"full support for Ukraine's territorial integrity and sovereignty\". Donald Trump also suggested that European troops could be involved in Ukraine - something Moscow says IT won't allow. Donald Trump told reporters he and Vladimir Putin spoke about Ukraine before Russia's full-scale invasion of the country in 2022. \"I think everyone knew that this is something that should have never happened, would have never happened,\" he said. \"And I used to discuss it with Putin.

And I told him: 'You better not go in, don't go in, don't go in.' And he understood that and he understood it fully.\"\n",

      "Deploying armed forces from other countries to Ukraine would be “completely unacceptable”, Moscow told US officials during Saudi Arabia talks in a dig at Keir Starmer’s plan to put boots on the ground.\n",

      "Speaking following talks with top US diplomats in Riyadh, Russian Foreign minister Sergie Lavrov said that \"any appearance by armed forces under some other flag does not change anything”, adding that it would “it is of course completely unacceptable\". It comes after Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he was ready and willing to put British boots on the ground as part of a peacekeeping force, a plan met with some opposition from European leaders. Donald Trump had also refused to rule out sending peacekeeping troops to Ukraine, the US President’s peace envoy said on Monday. However, Lavrov said the US \"now has a better understanding of our position\", describing his talks four-hour talks with Trump's delegation on Tuesday as “very useful”.

On the US side, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he was \"convinced\" that Moscow was \"willing to begin to engage in a serious process\", describing today’s meeting as the “the first step of a long and difficult journey\" to ending the war in Ukraine. Meanwhile, Volodymyr Zelenskyy hit out at Russia for being blocked out Saudi Arabia talks held “behind our backs\".  Speaking following the meeting the Ukrainian leader said that such negotiations \"should not take place” if his officials are excluded. Zelenskyy has since cancelled a planned trip to Saudi Arabia, which was reportedly unrelated to the Russia-US meeting. It comes after the Kremlin said Russian President Vladimir Putin was ready to enter talks with Kyiv.  Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Putin has “repeatedly said he is ready to speak about peace” but stressed that Moscow's “wider security issues” need to be addressed first. “Putin himself said that he would be ready to negotiate with Zelenskyy if necessary but the legal basis of agreements needs discussion considering the reality that Zelenskyy’s legitimacy can be questioned,” he added.\n",

      "The UK is facing “a new era of threat” from Russia, Defence Secretary John Healey has warned as he promised the \"biggest shake-up\" to Britain's military in 50 years to ensure the country is prepared for war. \n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking at the Institute for Government (IfG) on Tuesday, the cabinet minister said Britain needs to 're-arm' if it is to handle pressures from hostile states. He also unveiled a new command structure in the Ministry of Defence (MoD) and pledged to tear apart Conservative-era policies, replacing them with sweeping reforms to provide a 'more muscular defence for a more dangerous world'. Mr Healy said these represent ‘the biggest shake up of UK defence for over 50 years’. The defence secretary argued the UK is ‘buying better what our front line forces need’, vowing to cut waste and reduce duplication in the MoD. Read more: Healey sets out plan to fast-track cyber experts to combat Putin’s online threat Read more: UK needs to ‘spend less on welfare and more on defence’ to support Ukraine, former Shadow Foreign Secretary tells LBC Mr Healey also announced plans for four senior leadership roles in the department for “clear points of accountability at every level within UK defence”. It comes as Sir Keir Starmer said he was ready to put British forces on the ground to help protect Ukraine, which he has described as the “frontline” of Britain. The Prime minister has also warned Ukraine is \"an existential question for Europe as a whole, and therefore vital for Britain's national interests.\" He continued: \"This is a once in a generation moment for the collective security of our continent.\" His comments came as Britain, along with Kyiv and Europe, were blocked out of Russia-US peace talks held in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday. Insead, European descended leaders descended on the Elysee Palace in Paris late on Monday for an emergency summit. Starmer’s plans were criticised by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, left the crisis summit early after commenting that he was a \"little irritated\" at the Prime Minister's \"highly inappropriate\" comments. Starmer had said troops on the ground were needed to protect Ukraine - with a unified force patrolling the Ukraine-Russia border.  Poland, Spain, and Italy joined Germany in raising doubts over the idea. Following the meeting, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer stressed that a US security guarantee is the only path to peace, saying a \"US backstop\" is the \"only way to effectively deter Russia from attacking Ukraine again\" He is still expected to press his argument for US security guarantees when he flies to Washington for talks with President Donald Trump next week. Speaking to LBC in December, Healey said his job is to rebuild the strength of... British defences\". He told Andrew Marr his department has a \"determination to play a leading role in NATO and recognise that Britain has a role in coordinating allies, including in support of Ukraine, which is the job in hand... for me today.\" Last year, a former head of the army, General Sir Patrick Sanders, warned that civilians might need to be called up in the event of a war, with the number of troops at its lowest level in centuries. And the current army chief General Sir Roly Walker, said that the UK must be ready to fight a war in three years and that the size of the fighting force needed to triple. Mr Healey said: \"The UK, in keeping with many other nations, has essentially become very skilled and ready to conduct military operations. \"What we've not been ready to do is to fight. And unless we are ready to fight, we are not in a shape to deter.\" He added that this was \"at the heart\" of thinking within Nato.\n",

Here we have a different approach that is well known,\" he said. Putin is also ready to meet US President Donald Trump, Peskov added. He did not give a date for a potential meeting, stressing it is impossible to give any sense of the talks as they had only just begun. It comes as the Ukrainian leader was blocked out of peace talks held in at Diriyah Palace in Riyadh on Tuesday.  zelenskyy has said his country will not accept any deal negotiated without Ukrainian officials. Top US diplomats attending the meeting included Secretary of State Marco Rubio, national security adviser Mike Waltz and White House Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov was sent to lead Putin's delegation descending on Diriyah Palace, Riyadh. Yuri Ushakov, Russian aide to the president, was also present.  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday Putin was serious about negotiating a settlement to end the war in Ukraine. Ahead of the Saudi Arabia meeting, Peskov said it would be “primarily devoted to restoring the whole complex of Russian-American relations”. He added discussions will be held “possible negotiations on a Ukrainian resolution, and organising a meeting between the two presidents”.

Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said MPs are likely to get a vote before any deployment of British troops to Ukraine.  Speaking to The Times on Tuesday, she said it would be \"normal, if circumstances allow, for Parliament to be consulted\" on military action, but added: \"I do think we are some way away from this at the moment.\" A statement from Russian Investor Dmitry Rybolovlev's family office said Mr Rybolovlev was not taking part in the US-Russia talks in Riyadh.\n",

      "German Chancellor Olaf Scholz left the crisis summit early after commenting that he was a \"little irritated\" at the Prime Minister's \"highly inappropriate\" comments. It comes ahead of US-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, with Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, and Putin aide, Yuri Ushakov, meeting with US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, national security adviser, Mike Waltz, and Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff. During the three-hour meeting in Paris, the PM said he will ensure the UK is a \"leading country\" among European nations. But as Europe descended on the Elysee Palace in Paris late on Monday to discuss Ukraine, European representatives appeared disgruntled. Calls from Starmer for troops on the ground to protect Ukraine - a unified force patrolling the Ukraine-Russia border, saw Poland, Spain, and Italy joining Germany in raising doubts over the idea. Mr Scholz said calls for peacekeeping troops was \"premature\", adding: \"I am even a little irritated by these debates, I want to say that quite frankly. \"The discussion is being held over Ukraine's head, over the outcome of peace talks that have not taken place and to which Ukraine has not said yes... \"This is highly inappropriate, to put it bluntly, and honestly: we don't even know what the outcome will be.\" It follows US president Donald Trump's push for a deal with Russia's Vladimir Putin, as the President's administration arrived in Saudi Arabia ahead of talks. Sir Keir added that the fate of Ukraine is an \"existential question\" on Monday night, adding that it is time to \"take responsibility\" for its security. He urged Donald Trump to provide a \"backstop\" to any Ukraine peace settlement, insisting it is the only way to deter Russia from attacking the country again. The PM said he would be prepared to send peacekeeping troops to Ukraine, but some present at the meeting - including German Chancellor Olaf Scholz - resisted calls for any European force being used to monitor a ceasefire.  Sir Keir said: \"We're in a very early stage of the discussions at the moment, obviously, and the most important thing as we go into these discussions is to maintain the principle of peace through strength, and what I mean by that is making sure that Ukraine is in the strongest possible position.  \t \"It would be a big mistake to think that just because there may be talks that now is the time to back down on any support for Ukraine, we need to ramp it up in my view and I've been saying that for many months now.  \t \"What we also need to do is to ensure that if there is an agreement, it is a lasting and enduring and just agreement that secures the sovereignty of Ukraine and that has to be at the heart of it.  \t \"And then, of course, the question of security guarantees.  \t \"But whether it's on security guarantees or the wider collective defence in terms of funding or capability, I think this is the moment for European countries to step up, and I am going to ensure the UK is a leading country in that endeavour.\" Sir Keir also said it is time for Europe to \"take responsibility\" for its security.  \t \"I spoke to President Zelensky on Friday and will do so again in coming days and we envisage a further meeting with European colleagues when I return from the US.  \t \"In this moment we have to recognise the new era that we are in, not cling hopelessly to the comforts of the past.  \t \"It's time for us to take responsibility for our security, for our continent and I've been clear today Britain will take a leading responsibility, as we always have, because Ukraine must have a secure future, Europe must have a secure future, Britain must have a secure future and democratic values must prevail.\" Speaking after the meeting of leaders in Paris on Monday, he said: \"At stake is not just the future of Ukraine. It is an existential question for Europe as a whole, and therefore vital for Britain's national interest. \"This is a once in a generation moment for the collective security of our own continent. Only a lasting peace in Ukraine that safeguards its sovereignty will deter Putin from further aggression in the future. \"Recent statements by the US administration should not come as a surprise.

      "The Ukraine war is the \"frontline\" for Britain's national security, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has said, as US and Russian officials meet today in Saudi Arabia for peace talks. \n",
      "Starmer's comments come ahead of an emergency summit in Paris after Europe was blocked out of the Saudi Arabia meeting.  Speaking ahead of the summit, Starmer said: \"I think there's a bigger piece here as well, which is that this isn't just about the frontline in Ukraine. \"It's the frontline of Europe and of the United Kingdom. It's our national security.\" He stressed that the continent is facing a \"generational challenge\" over defence, adding that \"we must continue to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position.\" The Prime minister said that Europe needs to \"make sure that if there is peace - and we all want peace - that it is lasting.\" He called on European leaders to \"step up\", adding that it is vital to have “realistic and credible answers”. This comes after the Starmer's announcement that he is \"ready\" and \"willing\" to deploy British troops to Ukraine if a peace deal is reached, pledging £3bn annually in military aid until 2030. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky revealed today that “tens of thousands” of Ukrainian troops were missing in action or being held in Russian captivity as Vladimir Putin's war approaches its three-year anniversary.  Morre then 46,000 soldiers have been killed so far, Zelensky said, although his figures differ from some estimates by Kyiv's allies.

We have talked about it for too long – and President Trump is right to demand that we get on with it. \"As European nations, we must increase our defence spending and take on a greater role in NATO. Non-US NATO nations have already increased defence spending by 20 per cent in the past year, but we must go further.\"  Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will also not take part in peace talks this week, despite also travelling to Saudi Arabia, according to reports.  The Ukrainian leader's spokesman told AFP he will arrive one day after Russian and US officials meet.  Sergiy Nykyforov said Zelensky is visiting the country as part of a \"long-planned\" official visit. Zelensky was in the United Arab Emirates  arrived in the United Arab Emirates late on Sunday ahead of the US-Russia negotiations.  Mykhailo Podolyak, a top adviser to Zelensky, has publicly dismissed the idea of Ukraine engaging in the Saudi Arabia negotiations, saying, \"There is nothing on the negotiating table that would be worth discussing.\"\n",

      "A teacher has been sacked after their joke about 'whacking' a pupil over the head was not understood.\n",
      "Baiklautchmee Subrian, who has over 35 years' experience as a teacher, was sacked after a child who spoke English as a second language misunderstood the comment. She was dismissed from Gilbert Colvin Primary School in Ilford, east London, in 2023 following the incident. Ms Subrian took the school to an employment tribunal, claiming the remark had been made \"in jest\" while teaching Year 6 pupils and preparing them for their maths SAT exam, according to the Times. Almost everyone in the class knew it was not intended to be unkind, she said.

Ms Subrian responded saying that she would \"whack\" them while gesturing with her hand. The pupil felt threatened, upset and angry over the remark and told another teacher, the hearing was told. The following day, Ms Subrian was asked to meet the head of school and told that there would be an investigation into the incident. Speaking at a disciplinary hearing in July 2023, she said that the child's decision to continue attending her after-school club showed that they had not been that upset. However, in a letter of dismissal sent later that same month, it said due to the pupil not having English as a first language they \"could not be expected to understand\". Ms Subrian has argued that the punishment was too severe and claimed the school's investigation 'lacked integrity'. However, her claim of unfair dismissal was rejected at her employment tribunal in east London. Judge Jack Feeny said in his closing comments: \"I do not consider whether or not the comment was intended as a joke to be particularly important. It was plainly an inappropriate thing to say. \"The accompanying hand gesture compounded matters, particularly where at least some of the children did not have English as a first language. \"A teacher may get away with a comment in these circumstances if all children receive it as a light-hearted comment and laugh along. It is common ground that this was not what happened here. \"The risk of making such a joke is that if even only one child is upset by it, it must amount to a significant safeguarding issue.\"\n",

      "Police said they were called to 32 Portland Place, known for notorious sex parties, at 7am on Sunday morning following reports of an assault. A group of men used knives to stab party-goers during the fight, according to The Sun. The mansion is where OnlyFans star Bonnie Blue recently slept with more than 1,000 men in 12 hours. A source told The Sun: “There was blood everywhere with people lying injured all over the place. “It looked like a battle scene rather than a sex club.” Met officers attended along with the London Ambulance service and four people were taken to hospital. Three of the victims had been stabbed, police said. Their injuries are not believed to be life threatening. Three men were arrested, one on suspicion of GBH and possession with intent to supply, one man on suspicion of GBH and another man on suspicion of possession with intent to supply.  Police said they had imposed a Section 76 Closure Notice “to prevent further disruption to the local area,” which allows them to shutter the property for up to 48 hours.

Magistrates were told last year that police had been dispatched to the address 63 times over the last few years. Neighbours have said they have suffered years of extremely loud music, revellers taking drugs and vomiting in the street. Last December, Davenport flew back from Thailand to successfully challenge the closure order at City of London Magistrates’ Court. He denies hosting all-night parties, saying he hosts art shows there every months with around 100 people, but that gatherings do not go on beyond midnight. He also denied any drug-taking at the mansion. “I am very anti-drugs, I don’t drink, I have had two kidney transplants,” he said. “Nobody would be smoking marijuana in my house. “I am absolutely certain there is no illegal activity (at the parties).” Magistrate Mr Gowlett said at the time: “We do not find the case for closure has been proved on balance of probability, and therefore refuse the order that is sought.”\n",

Anyone with a hazelnut allergy who unwittingly ate these products could face serious health problems. Around 2% of children and 0.5% of adults in the UK have a tree nut allergy, according to Allergy UK.

The affected batches of Cheshire Farm's 1L Biscoff Ice Cream tubs are under codes L23139, with a best before date of 19 November, 2024, and L23261, with a best before date of 18 March, 2025. The affected batch of Caramelized Biscuit Ice Cream was sold under the code L24150, with the best before date of 29 November, 2025. Cheshire Farm said that anyone who had bought these products should not eat them if they have a nut allergy, and instead should take them back to the shop for a refund. The company warned: \"If you have bought the above products and have an allergy to nuts do not eat them.\" Cheshire Farm also said it did not have any affiliation with the Lotus Biscoff brand and its ice cream does not contain any Biscoff products.\n",

      "Mikel Arteta said he would concede the Premier League title to Liverpool \"over my dead body\" as he insisted Arsenal can still be crowned champions.\n",
      "The Gunners head to Nottingham Forest on Wednesday 11 points adrift of Liverpool following the Reds' weekend victory at Manchester City, a day after Arteta's side slumped to a 1-0 loss against West Ham at the Emirates. Following the defeat to the Hammers - after which he criticised his players for failing to reach the standards required to end the club's 21-year wait for the title - Arteta conceded the championship race was no longer in his hands. Read More: Galatasaray accuse Fenerbahce boss Jose Mourinho of making 'racist statements' Read More: Moise Kean update after ex-Everton star rushed to hospital after collapsing on the pitch But speaking on the eve of Arsenal's trip to third-placed Forest, the Spaniard said: \"I'm not going to stop, over my dead body. \"If I think that way, I'll go home. Mathematically, it's possible. You are there. You have to play every game. Suddenly, three days ago, we could close the gap to five points. It doesn't matter. We have to continue to go. \"The difficulty is higher than it was. But if you want to win the the Premier League, you're going to have to do something special. You're probably going to have to do something that nobody else has done in the history of the Premier League.\" Arsenal's bid to win the title has been derailed by a series of injuries, with Kai Havertz and Gabriel Jesus out for the season. Bukayo Saka is due to return next month having been sidelined since December, while Gabriel Martinelli is also currently unavailable. Captain Martin Odegaard missed 12 games with an ankle injury earlier in the campaign, while Arsenal have also battled suspensions. Five players have been sent off in their 26 league games so far. The Gunners have been Liverpool's closest challengers this season, and have progressed to the last 16 of the Champions League, but Arteta believes his side could easily have been dumped out of Europe and left battling in mid-table. He continued: \"If somebody tells you at the start of the season, by this time, you have played five times with a red card over half an hour in each of those games, and you have lost this amount of players, what's the bet? You are in the middle of the table, at least, and you are out of the Champions League. \"That's not the situation. So that tells you the resilience, the resources, the ambition that the team has, every individual has, and that has been probably been one of the proudest moments in my time to work. \"It was a very disappointing weekend. In the previous 15 games, we have won 10 and drawn five, exactly the same as Liverpool, with exactly the same goal difference, which is plus 23. \"We have been extremely consistent for the last three and a half months, considering everything that we've been through, and we have generated that momentum. \"When you are trying to build that momentum and we're putting so much into it, especially with the circumstances that we have, the defeat against West Ham was a very hard one to take. On top of that, they (Liverpool) win. \"But the reality is that there's so many games to play, and you have to get back to it. You're going to have to set a certain amount of numbers to win this league.\"And we're going to have to hit that number if we're going to have any chance of doing that. But we're certainly going to continue to try.\"  \n",

      "The chief executive of NHS England Amanda Pritchard is to step down from her role.\n",
      "Ms Pritchard has announced she will stand down at the end of the financial year, saying it was a \"hugely difficult decision\".  \t In a statement, she said: \"It has been an enormous privilege to lead the NHS in England through what has undoubtedly been the most difficult period in its history.  \t \"I am immensely proud of the NHS response to Covid-19, and how we have delivered steady recovery from the inevitable impacts of the pandemic, with performance in urgent and emergency care, elective and cancer all improving over the past two years, while NHS teams delivered record levels of activity in primary care, community and mental health services, meaning millions more appointments for patients.  \t \"We always knew the recovery period after a once-in-a-century pandemic was going to be incredibly challenging, and whilst the timeliness and experience of care is still not good enough for too many people, the NHS has achieved a great deal in the face of historic pressure thanks to a relentless focus on innovation and reform.  \t \"From the rollout of Community Diagnostic Centres and mental health teams in schools, to world leading cancer vaccines and the development of the App, the NHS now feels very different to when I became chief executive over three and a half years ago.  \t \"While it has been a hugely difficult decision for me to stand down, I believe now is the right time, with the NHS making continued progress in our recovery, and with the foundations firmly in place to deliver the 10-Year Health Plan.  \t \"The NHS is full of extraordinary people, who do extraordinary things every day for patients.  \"The achievements I have listed above, and many more, are theirs - and I am confident they will continue to achieve incredible things for patients now, and into the future.\" Health Secretary Wes Streeting has said Ms Pritchard should be \"enormously proud of the leadership\" she's given the NHS. \"She steered NHS England out of the pandemic, during turbulent political waters and six secretaries of state.   \"She has led with integrity and unwavering commitment,\" he added.

      "The club said it would also submit complaints to governing bodies UEFA and FIFA after the Fenerbahce boss's comments following Monday's 0-0 draw between the top two sides. The former Chelsea, Manchester United, Tottenham and Real Madrid manager made comments about the Galatasaray bench \"jumping like monkeys\" after an early challenge and the match being better because it was not officiated by a Turkish referee.

The Portuguese was charged with \"unsportsmanlike behaviour towards opposing team fans\" and \"diminishing the value of Turkish football and... discrediting the impartiality of the referees and other match officials\" during an outspoken post-match interview.\n",

      "The head of Ofcom has told LBC that the regulator will \"name and shame\" social media companies that fail to protect women and girls in the UK adequately.\n",
      "Melanie Dawes, who runs the communications regulator, told LBC's Nick Ferrari at Breakfast that women face \"a real culture of misogyny, harassment [and] intimate image abuse\". She was describing Ofcom's plans to \"shine a light\" on tech companies that fail to be proactive in making their sites safer and easier to use, especially for women and girls. The regulator is consulting on new guidance on measures tech firms should use to help better protect women and girls on their sites. These will include the better use of technology to prevent intimate image abuse, as well as a request for sites to consider introducing tools which would help spot and fix ways they can be exploited by abusers. Dawes said the problem was even more widespread than some might think. \"When I talk to women, you know, what's so striking is this isn't a niche issue, this isn't about just vulnerable women, it's actually about ordinary women going about their daily lives online,\" she said. She claimed that women are \"five times more likely than men to have intimate image abuse against them, much more likely to have harassments or pile-ons just for expressing an opinion.  \"So it's fundamentally about people's freedom of speech not actually being a real thing online, if you're a woman in the UK, in the same way as it is for men.\" The guidance joins already published legally binding codes of practice on illegal content and protecting children online that have already been put in place by Ofcom. These will begin to take effect next month under the Online Safety Act, and which carry large financial penalties if found to have been breached. Dawes said it was unclear to what extent the tech firms themselves would take action when the Online Safety Act comes in, and how much Ofcom would need to enforce. \"It's a six million dollar question how much action is going to come and how much are we going to need to drive through with enforcement action,\" she said. \"We're ready for that. But this is a big cultural change for the industry. There's a lot to fix. So all eyes now on the tech industry as far as I'm concerned.\" Dawes said in an earlier statement that the new guidance was a \"call to action for online services\". \"There's not only a moral imperative for tech firms to protect the interests of female users, but it also makes sound commercial sense - fostering greater trust and engagement with a significant proportion of their customer base,\" she said.\" Dawes' colleague Jessica Smith, who led the development of the guidance, said the regulator was also prepared to use its powers under the Online Safety Act to highlight platforms not doing enough to protect women and girls on their sites through new online safety transparency reports. \"Effectively, what we are going to do is use our information-gathering and transparency powers,\" she told the PA news agency. \"So one of the things we're committing to do is, once the guidance is finalised and a sufficient period of time has passed, is we'll publish a transparency report that shines a light on what platforms are doing and not doing to keep their users safe. \"It's about putting information out there, so users can be informed and make a choice about where they spend their time online.\" She added: \"What we're saying to platforms today is that you have a commercial choice. \"We know that women spend longer online than men, for example, on a daily basis, and so we think it makes good commercial sense to take their safety seriously. \"For some platforms, they may not choose to do that, and that is their decision. But as I said, then we will make sure people know what kind of space they are entering into when they go on that kind of platform.\" Under the Online Safety Act, platforms will be legally required to follow a new set of duties around protecting users from harm online, with fines of up to 10% of global turnover for those who fail to do so - which could run into billions of pounds for the largest services. New regulation of the online world has been broadly welcomed, but some charities and campaigners have warned that the current plans have taken too long to implement, and do not go far enough to protect users from harm. In response, Ms Smith said: \"We're at the fairly early days when it comes to implementation of the Act. \"I think we're still at the stage of testing and implementing the powers that we have now, and I know that this has taken a while, so I really understand people's frustration. \"I think when it comes to this particular guidance, we are balancing quite difficult issues. There are issues around free expression.\" As well as women and girls, Ms Smith said it was vital the regulator also heard from men and boys on the issues raised. \"Obviously, this guidance is focused on women and girls, and we've spoken to a lot of survivors and women's advocacy organisations as part of the process, but it's also for men and boys - these tools can be for everybody,\" she said. \"We know boys are more exposed to online misogyny than girls are, so we think that this will have broader benefits and we're keen to speak to men and boys as part of our consultation process.\"\n",

      "Robotics company Ocean Infinity is looking for the wreckage of the plane on the seabed of the Indian Ocean, 1,200 miles off the western Australian city of Perth. Its deep-water support vessel Armada 7806 deployed autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) at the search site. These are operated via satellite from a control room at the company's headquarters in Southampton. If the wreckage is found, then Ocean Infinity can also send out remote vehicles to help recover it, also to be controled remotely. The mission may represent the last hope of finding MH370, which disappeared on March 8, 2014 after taking off from Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur for a flight to Beijing.

All 239 people who were on board are presumed dead - but none have been found, and there is no conclusive explanation for what happened. Two major search operations were launched, one from 2014-2017, and another in 2018, neither of which found the aircraft. Several pieces of debris washed up onshore in the years following the disappearance, some of which were confirmed to belong to MH370. Ocean Infinity was previously in talks with the Malaysian government for a £55 million payout if it found the wreckage, operating on a 'no-find, no-fee' basis. But no agreement is thought to have been finalised, and the Telegraph reported that the company was operating on its own account. Ocean Infinity founder Oliver Plunkett has described finding the wreckage as his life's ambition. A previous mission by the company in 2018 was abandoned without success. This mission, due to last four weeks, will focus on an arc in the southern Indian Ocean where the plane is thought to have come down. Ocean Infinity will scour up to four sites where the plane may have crashed, including one where earlier searches may not have given enough attention. The total search area is thought to be around 5,800 square miles.\n",

      "A cameraman for a controversial BBC documentary about life in Gaza has been accused of ‘celebrating’ the October 7 massacre.\n",
      "Hatem Rawagh is reported to have praised the terror attack on social media. He tweeted about the 1973 Yom Kippur war - when Egypt and Syria attacked Israel. In the post he said: “Whoever missed Oct 6 in Egypt...Oct 7 is happening in Palestine.” He went on to post online apparently celebrating the killing of an Israeli soldier.  He captioned a video of a gunman: “You are going back to this video a million times.” The video was originally posted by Hamas’s al-Qassam brigades. It depicts the point of view of a gunman killing a soldier in Erez, near the Gaza border. He also shared celebrations at the Omari mosque in Gaza in April 2023 after a car attack in Tel Aviv which killed an Italian tourist and left seven others injured.

The documentary was made by the BBC's Current Affair TV arm which paid award-winning Hoyo Films to make it. Former director of BBC television Danny Cohen said: \"The BBC needs to account for every penny spent on this documentary - £400,000 is a lot of licence-fee payers money.  \"They should be transparently told where their money went and whether any of it reached the hands of Hamas. \"The BBC must also launch a wider investigation into systemic bias against Israel after repeated editorial failures since the October 7 massacres.\" The BBC initially kept the documentary online with an added disclaimer before removing it from iPlayer while conducting further ‘due diligence’. It is co-directed by Jamie Roberts, an Emmy-award-winning filmmaker, and Yousef Hammash, a Bafta-award-winning Palestinian journalist. It was filmed by two cameramen which Mr Rawagh hired as an “additional camera.” Mr Rawagh’s tweets were uncovered by the Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting and Analysis (Camera). A spokesman for Camera said: “These posts appear to be glorifying the horrific terrorist acts committed on October 7, 2023. Anyone who wrote them has no place working for the BBC. Here is yet more evidence of the editorial failings in the documentary for which the BBC must answer.” An internal report into the programme will be presented to the BBC board on Thursday. The corporation is expected to announce a summary of findings either on Thursday or by Friday morning. According to the Telegraph, the programme was viewed by Jo Carr, the BBC’s head of current affairs, prior to broadcast. She described the documentary as a “story of immense consequence” in a press release issued on Jan 20. A BBC spokesman said: “Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone features important stories we think should be told – those of the experiences of children in Gaza. There have been continuing questions raised about the programme and in the light of these, we are conducting further due diligence with the production company. The programme will not be available on iPlayer while this is taking place.”\n",

      "Energy bills are set to rise again, with the price cap lifted by more than expected.\n",
      "Regulator Ofgem announced on Tuesday that its energy price cap would go up by 6% from 1 April, taking the typical gas and electricity bill to £1,849 per year, from £1,738. Industry onlookers had expected the price cap to rise by 5%. Ofgem said a recent spike in wholesale prices was the main driver of the price rise, accounting for around 78% of the total increase, while a small increase in policy costs and associated inflationary pressures made up a further 22%. Ofgem chief executive Jonathan Brearley said: \"We know that no price rise is ever welcome, and that the cost of energy remains a huge challenge for many households. Read more: Nearly three million more households could get energy bill discounts next winter, Labour says Read more: Landlords face £6k bill to meet higher energy efficiency targets under government plans \"But our reliance on international gas markets leads to volatile wholesale prices, and continues to drive up bills, which is why it's more important than ever that we're driving forward investment in a cleaner, homegrown system. \"Energy debts that began during the energy crisis have reached record levels and without intervention will continue to grow. This puts families under huge stress and increases costs for all customers. We're developing plans that could give households with unmanageable debt the clean slate they need to move forward. \"We welcome the Government's support for these plans, and their plans to expand the Warm Home Discount, which will also offer financial help to nearly three million more households that need it most. \"If anyone is worried about paying their bills, I would urge them to reach out to their supplier to make sure they're getting all the help they can. Where possible, switching or fixing tariffs now could also help to bring costs down and provide certainty over coming payments.\" It comes as the government said on Tuesday that it was looking to expand its financial support for energy bills. Ministers said next winter one in five families in Britain would get financial help. Around 2.7 million extra households, including nearly one million with children, would be eligible for the £150 Warm Home Discount next winter, the government added. This would bring the total number of recipient homes to an estimated 6.1 million. Responding to the price cap rise, Simon Francis, coordinator of campaign group the End Fuel Poverty Coalition, called for billions more in support for vulnerable customers. He said it is \"crucial to provide support for vulnerable households struggling with energy costs now\", calling for £13.2 billion of support at the Government's upcoming spending review. \"The big question will be how do we pay for these improvements in support. Both Warm Home Discounts and debt relief are traditionally funded through our energy bills. \"Yet the energy industry makes billions of pounds in profit every year and it beggars belief that Ofgem is increasing the profit allowance for suppliers in the current climate. \"For now, the advice for households is to make the most of existing energy efficiency schemes and if customers do shop around for a lower energy bill, they must use their own energy usage on price comparison sites.\"\n",

      "Boris Johnson has told LBC that the UK should commit to spending 3% of GDP on defence and commit up to 10,000 troops to Ukraine to lead a \"deterrent force\" in the country, ahead of Keir Starmer’s trip to Washington.\n",
      "Increasing the UK’s spending on defence would lead to economic growth and more jobs, the former Prime Minister told LBC's Nick Ferrari at Breakfast. It comes after reports that Starmer would overrule chancellor Rachel Reeves and increase military spending in a bid to woo Donald Trump before he flies out to Washington D.C. this week, though this has not happened yet. Boris Johnson has now said the UK should “get there now and we need to commit to [spending] 3%” of GDP on defence, claiming the increase will benefit the UK economy. Read more: Ukraine war could end ‘within weeks’ Trump claims as he warns it ‘may lead to WW3’ if not stopped He told Nick Ferrari: “For listeners who are worried about us spending all this money on defence right now … there's ways and ways of doing this, borrowing it, whatever. “However we choose to spend this money, this can lead to jobs and growth in the uk. We're very, very good at producing some of these technologies that the Ukrainians need, whether it's drones or munitions or whatever. “And it will drive employment, it will drive long term growth in Lancashire, in Bristol, around the country. And we should think of it that way.” The former PM also said the UK should lead a ‘deterrent force’ in Ukraine by sending up to 10,000 troops to the country, something he said the US would be expecting from Europe. It comes after Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he was ready and willing to put British boots on the ground as part of a peacekeeping force, a plan met with some opposition from European leaders. Mr Johnson said: “The Europeans will be expected by the Americans to provide a deterrent force in Ukraine and the Americans will not put boots on the ground. “So we've got to lead it, I think between 5,000 and 10,000 probably we could do from the, from the UK obviously, it depends how long the commitment would be for, how they would be rotated and so forth.” Read more: MP Mike Amesbury jailed for 10 weeks for punching man in street in 'unprovoked drunken' assault He added that this “would be a future deterrent force to offer logistical support, training, everything that is needed to back up the Ukrainians in the context of a ceasefire and a deal.” While the Russians initially rejected Starmer’s plan to send a peacekeeping force as “completely unacceptable”, Donald Trump said on Monday that Putin would be open to such a plan. The relationship between the US and Europe has become increasingly fragile after Donald Trump began negotiating with Russian president Vladimir Putin to end the war in Ukraine, excluding Kyiv from the talks. The US president also blamed Ukraine for the war and criticised the country's leader, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, for complaining that Kyiv has been excluded from negotiations about its own future. Trump made remarks implying that Ukraine \"should have never started it\" and criticized Zelensky's wartime leadership, calling him a \"dictator\" and accusing him of failing to hold elections due to martial law, which is prohibited under Ukraine's constitution during wartime. Read more: Zelenskyy hopes war will end 'this year' as US votes with Russia against UN resolution condemning invasion Johnson has called Trump’s comments on Zelenskyy “flat out lies” and “incredibly painful for people who love Ukraine”. However, Johnson said if you look at the text of an agreement on the table between Ukraine and the USA it was \"very promising\" “That deal with America with Donald Trump is actually now, I think, much, much better than it was,” he told Nick. “And it contains some very good commitments by the United States. I mean, I've obviously seen some drafts, I've seen the latest one today. It contains some very good commitments by the US to the freedom, sovereignty and security of Ukraine,” he added. “It commits the US to long term investment in Ukraine. It commits the fund that the Ukraine and the US will set up to long term investment in the security of Ukraine. There's good stuff in it.”\n",

      "Today will see representatives from tech companies answer questions from MPs about the role their platforms played in spreading hate, harm and misinformation in the wake of the Southport attack.\n",
      "We can expect deflection and obfuscation to tough questions, which these companies will simply absorb as a PR exercise while dodging meaningful action to make their sites safe. It is not just the aftermath of the attack that companies should answer for. The violent content Axel Rudakubana viewed in the moments before the attack shouldn’t have been available in the first place but still largely remains online. The fluid ideologies highlighted by the case are playing out in the form of extreme violence and grooming children into livestreaming attempted suicide and self-harm acts. Meanwhile hugely damaging suicide, self-harm and depression content like that Molly Russell viewed before her death remains online, amplified by aggressive algorithms to vulnerable young people. Instead of pulling up the drawbridge Meta has chosen to scale back how it deals with much of this content, with no reassurances that their rule changes won’t leave our children worse off. When a coroner ruled social media played a part in Molly’s death it should have been Big Tech’s Big Tobacco moment. Instead we are going backwards. Despite being warned about the fluid ideological groups that are driving these disturbing new threat behaviours over a year ago, the regulator Ofcom ignored our warnings and even dismissed a public advisory from the FBI. In fact, their rules for tackling illegal behaviour online contained no specific measures for companies to address illegal self-harm and suicide content. Ofcom’s lack of ambition has highlighted deep weaknesses in the existing Online Safety Act and shown us a regime that is far more focused on economic proportionality than protecting a generation of children at risk. It is now over to the Prime Minister to act. New legislation that focusses on the conduct of tech companies is crucial. A strengthened and reworked Online Safety Act that enforces a Duty of Care on companies is urgently required - otherwise Big Tech will hide behind weak regulations and say they are complying with the law. Recent reports suggest that Big Tech has the ear of the Government. Secretary of State Peter Kyle met big tech companies no less than 14 times in just three months. Sir Keir Starmer should listen to the clear message from UK parents and families instead. This country wants an end to preventable harm and decisive action to keep our children safe. ________________ Andy Burrows is Chief Executive of the Molly Rose Foundation.

      "Emerging evidence that the UK’s Net Zero economy is not only viable but thriving is exactly the kind of renewable energy-powered jolt this country needs right now.\n",
      "At a time when we are nervously observing dominant nations creating a new world order, with the UK’s voice feeling weak and pushed to the sidelines, we must seize the moment. According to analysis by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), the net zero sector is growing three times faster than the overall UK economy, and I firmly believe this is only the beginning. But there is more at stake now than the economic growth this country so desperately needs. Our place at the top table of international influence is under threat and this may be our moment to reassert our nation’s voice. Despite its many vocal detractors, tackling climate change and economic growth through greater support and investment in Net Zero are inextricably linked. If we really grasp the business opportunity that Net Zero presents – something I have been loudly calling for in recent years – Britain has the potential to become a global superpower in the technologies and industries needed to underpin a transformational green revolution. Four years ago, I put forward the idea of creating a Silicon Valley for the environment based on investing in the creation of a 20,000-acre technology city to act as a hub for entrepreneurship, innovation, and R&D into renewable energy and green economy technologies. Now, the CBI’s contribution to the debate, although positive, is yet another timely reminder the clock is ticking, not just for Britain but for the planet. What is at stake is more than just the short-term potential to create jobs, attract inward investment and pump billions into our flagging economy to fund public services; in the long-term, we have a responsibility to future generations to rectify the damage we have inflicted on our planet. In 2023, I established the Caudwell Strong Britain Programme in partnership with the independent think-tank, the Council for Geostrategy. A key feature of the programme was an extensive piece of research, published last year, entitled: “British Science and Technology in 2024: Implications for Net Zero.” The report, with a forward by former Prime Minister Tony Blair, and unveiled at an event at the House of Commons, outlined a series of recommendations for UK public policy makers and the broader business community. Its findings were clear: Government support and targeted investment in the net zero sector are critical to accelerating our journey towards a greener, more prosperous future. The research argued persuasively that, with the right policy framework, we can unlock new sources of growth that will enable the UK to assert itself as a leader in the green economy. In addition, it set out a strategic path that involves not just incremental improvements, but a radical rethinking of how we approach economic development. At the heart of this strategy is the need for enhanced Government support through initiatives such as increased R&D funding, tax incentives for green investments, and streamlined regulations that encourage innovation. By creating an environment where businesses feel secure to invest in cutting-edge green technologies, we can generate a virtuous cycle of economic growth. And this isn’t a pie-in-the-sky dream; it is a pragmatic solution that addresses both our climate emergency and our economic challenges head-on. While we have seen some positive moves in this direction in recent Government announcements, we must move faster or risk lagging behind in a global race that we can win with greater and more focussed efforts. The net zero economy offers a new blueprint for growth – one that prioritises sustainability alongside profitability. By investing in green technology, renewable energy, and sustainable infrastructure, we can create a resilient economy that not only addresses environmental imperatives but also stimulates job creation, fosters technological advancements, and reinforces our international competitiveness. Yet, for all the promise that the Net Zero economy holds, the transition is not without its challenges. There is a need for more immediate, coordinated action. We must bridge the gap between ambition and execution by ensuring that Government policies are aligned with the needs of businesses, entrepreneurs and innovators. The recommendations of my Caudwell Strong Britain programme highlight the urgent need for a coherent strategy that incentivises investment and provides clear, long-term commitments from Government. We’ve seen some enticing starters on the policy menu; now we need the meat and two veg. A predictable policy environment is essential if we are to attract the levels of private investment necessary to drive this transformation. The CBI has shown us a welcome glimpse into our potential economic future, and it has revealed we’re already heading in the right direction. However, the time is right now to build on this for future generations, for the economy, for our standing on the world stage and, not least, for our good conscience. ________________ John Caudwell is a Business leader, philanthropist and the founder of Phones 4U.

      "The world was still grappling with Donald Trump’s attacks on Europe when he abruptly shifted to targeting Ukraine’s democratically elected president—attempting a mafia-style shakedown of the country while echoing Kremlin talking points. \n",
      "Echoing Russian propaganda, Trump falsely claimed Ukraine hadn’t held elections in years and that President Volodymyr Zelensky had just a 4% approval rating. “We have a situation where we haven’t had elections in Ukraine, where we have martial law,” he said, calling Zelensky a “dictator” and insisting, “Ukraine needs to hold an election... That’s not a Russia thing. That’s something coming from me.”   His remarks thrilled former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, who mocked: “If you had told me three months ago that these were the words of a U.S. president, I would have laughed out loud.” . A friendly reminder that this is also the same president that Russia attempted to assassinate multiple times since 2022.   In reality, Trump’s claim about Zelensky’s unpopularity is baseless. A Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) poll from early February found that 57% of Ukrainians trust Zelensky, a five-point rise since December.  Another survey showed that 69% believe he should remain in office until elections can be held after martial law ends. Meanwhile, 63% oppose any national vote before the war is over.  Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, stated on Sunday that the U.S. is \"very close\" to reaching a peace agreement with Russia, based on the Istanbul Protocol, which called for Ukraine's capitulation and the unilateral disarmament of Ukraine.  Witkoff also claimed the war was unnecessary and provoked, refusing to blame Russia. His remarks come after a three-and-a-half-hour meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier this month.  Trump’s transactional approach to Ukraine was evident when his administration proposed that Kyiv grant the U.S. a 50% stake in its rare-earth minerals—valued at approximately $500 billion.  Trump demanded that Ukraine sign the deal or else the country will have “a lot of problems.” Zelensky dismissed the proposal as unserious, stating, “I can’t sell our state.”   Under the proposal, all revenues would go into a U.S.-controlled fund until it reached $500 billion—over twice Ukraine’s pre-war GDP. Zelensky called the demand wildly disproportionate to the $120 billion in U.S. aid provided so far.  Trump has been furious, and The Economist noted that his team viewed this as justification to replace Zelensky—a stance reminiscent of his 2019 attempt to strong-arm Ukraine.  Trump favours a more compliant leader in Kyiv, one who would allow him to dictate terms, much like Putin’s own desire to replace Zelensky with a pro-Russian puppet.  Meanwhile, Trump claims he can swiftly end the war by pressuring Ukraine into negotiations, assuming Putin’s demands are limited to land and a neutral Ukraine.  This ignores the reality that Ukraine was already neutral before Russia’s first invasion in 2014. Serhii Plokhy, director of the Ukrainian Research Institute at Harvard, refuted this notion: “The idea that this is all about territory and that you have to make a deal, somehow drawing the border in the right place… is based on not understanding what this war is about.   Anatoliy, a commander of a mortar battery unit in Ukraine’s 92nd Separate Assault Brigade, currently engaged in fighting on the Kursk front in Ukrainian-occupied Russia, was blunt: “Honestly, I’m not thinking about politics right now and not reading anything. The bastards keep pushing.”   “Yesterday, a KAB bomb landed about 10 meters from my dugout, three of my guys got wounded. It’s brutal here, getting harder and harder to complete the mission.”   “It’s hell out here,” said Anatoliy.  Hryhoriy, a soldier from the 105th Territorial Defense Brigade currently fighting in Kharkiv Oblast, stated, “A traitor to democracy and all Western values. He [Trump] has turned the victim into the one guilty of the attack. He respects that bastard, sees him as a great strategist, and has decided to divide Ukraine with him.”  “It was expected that this wannabe businessman would propose unfair terms for forcing peace, but this… No words.”  “Our hope remains in Europe and in ourselves,” said Hryhoriy.  Ruslan, a platoon commander in the drone systems battalion of the 23rd Separate Mechanized Brigade, was clear about the resolve among Ukrainian troops amid Trump’s attacks against Ukraine and Zelensky.  “Right now, every soldier I know is determined to fight. Yes, the military supports President Zelensky’s rhetoric. We see exactly what Russia is doing in the occupied territories and are committed to resisting it.”  He highlighted Ukraine’s past security assurances: “The United States was one of the guarantors when Ukraine gave up one of the largest nuclear arsenals in Europe. Now, another supposed guarantor has attacked Ukraine, is destroying cities, and killing Ukrainian citizens—yet the newly elected U.S. president has chosen to justify the aggressor’s actions.”  Instead of holding Russia accountable, “he blames his predecessor and Ukraine’s legitimately elected president for allowing the war to happen while negotiating with terrorists behind Ukraine’s back,” Ruslan said.  He posed a final, pointed question: “What exactly has Russia promised President Trump in exchange for him sitting down at the negotiating table?”  ________________ David Kirichenko is an Associate Research Fellow at the Henry Jackson Society and has just returned from the frontlines in Ukraine.

      "President Trump’s outlandish statements about Ukraine have sent shockwaves around the world. From labelling President Zelenskyy a “dictator” to warning he “is not going to have a country left” – Trump’s commentary has sparked consternation and grave concern among world leaders across the globe. Many fear that Trump is gearing up to betray Ukraine for Vladimir Putin. But if we strip back the fiery rhetoric, and consider the underlying facts, a different and unexpected picture emerges: Ukraine is not Trump’s to give away. Trump’s negotiating tactics have been unspeakably hurtful to Ukrainians who have sacrificed so much to defend their freedom.  His claims that the Ukrainians are responsible for starting the war, or that President Zelenskyy wants to “keep the gravy train” of foreign aid running are grossly inflammatory. But so far, at least as reality is concerned, Trump’s bark is worse than his bite. At the time of writing this, he has not stopped the supply of arms to Ukraine nor disconnected Starlink – despite relentless public attacks on President Zelenskyy. While Trump’s push to strike a deal with Russia has rattled Europeans, and stoked fears their security will be irreparably weakened, there may be a method to his madness. By echoing Vladimir Putin’s rhetoric and making egregious claims against Ukraine, Trump has brought Putin to the negotiating table.  This may be due to competent psychologists advising Trump’s team, or his intuitive approach to a megalomaniac psychopath as an interlocutor, but the fact remains. Putin has taken the bait – and by drawing on sympathetic language, Trump has tempted Putin into the talks. Putin’s domestic propaganda machine, that just weeks ago called for a direct missile strike on Washington and its allies, is changing tack so fast that heads are spinning.According to some well-placed sources, there is a new popular word now in Putin’s security services circles - “Ourshington”. Alexander Bortnikov, the head of Russia’s FSB, has told journalists that contacts between the U.S. and Russian intelligence and security services have never actually stopped.  With this weirdest bromance in full swing, Trump has to come up with a deal or risk the most grotesque and humiliating public failure right in the beginning of his presidency. And the Ukrainians have obviously figured this out. President Zelenskyy has remained cool, calm and collected, politely rebuffing outlandish statements and made-up statistics thrown up at him. The indisputable reality is that whatever Russia and the U.S. may agree between themselves, unless it suits Ukraine and its people, no deal will happen. Moreover, whether by design or not, the public circus that is taking place has united the Ukrainian people and Ukrainian political opposition around President Zelenskyy, giving him leverage when he needs it most. A February poll found his approval rating to be at 57%, even before all the recent bruhaha. The shuttle diplomacy has begun, and the discussions remain in the early stages, but there are two outcomes that are now looking increasingly possible. The first and more likely outcome would be a cessation of fighting along the front line. Ukraine will never recognise the occupied territories as Russian. But, over the years, via diplomatic effort, or perhaps after the death of Putin, Ukraine will work on getting them back.  Ukraine will remain sovereign and independent, and its people will have agency and self-determination. Ukraine will start the process of joining the EU, and, eventually, in one or two U.S. Congresses, will start the process of joining NATO.  Its immediate and long-term security will be assured not as much by the very likely foreign contingent on the ground, but by the vast U.S. economic interests poised to enter the country. It is one thing to bomb a Ukrainian factory, and very much another to bomb a U.S.-owned one.  This investment, coupled with comprehensive modern reconstruction, will bring economic growth, employment and development to Ukraine. Ukraine will also have the opportunity to pursue war criminals in the international courts and actively seek compensation for the unspeakable hardship the country has suffered since the war began.  Kidnapped children, civilians and prisoners of war will be returned and reunited with their families. In whichever way this outcome will be spun by Putin’s propaganda machine, I am sure they will succeed. Those Russians who can think for themselves and have at least some disposable income will be happy to just have their credit cards working again and to get visas to the U.S. and direct flights to Europe. In the second outcome, no deal is reached in these negotiations and the war continues.  While this will be hard on Ukrainians, they appear more determined than ever. The Ukrainian army is evolving into one of the most effective fighting forces in the world, and their drone warfare capabilities are second to none.  Even if the U.S. stopped all of its aid, if we judge by the recent jump in the shares of German defence supplier Rheinmetall, help will continue coming from Europe. The EU has over €200 billion of frozen Russian assets and should the events take this terrible course, these funds will be used to power the Ukrainian war effort.  Concurrently, the EU will spend more on defence and will re-establish its military capability in light of the Trump administration’s apparent unreliability as a security partner. The Russian economy is a bubble with the Central Bank base rate at 21% , rampaging inflation, rapidly dilapidating infrastructure, banks and the Ministry of Finance being quietly bailed out by the Central Bank which keeps printing money and consumer business collapsing. Russian economic growth figures are a fiction based on military production which contributes nothing to the economy but further inflation. Russia also faces a workforce crisis, with a severe lack of employable hands both for the front and for the domestic economy. Should this war of attrition continue, Russia will find itself ill-equipped to outlast the Ukrainians. This war of attrition will be Russia’s second Afghanistan.  It was terrible on the Afghans, but guess what, their country is still there, while the Soviet Union exists only in Putin’s feverish dreams. No matter which of these paths history takes, our support for Ukraine now is more important than ever.  We must continue imposing pressure on our politicians to stand firm for freedom, democracy and international rule of law. Ukraine is fighting for all of our peace and prosperity, and we must be there to help Ukraine win. Lubov Chernukhin is Soviet-Born British Businesswoman.

      "Donald Trump said the US will start to impose 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico next month, after the countries struck deals with Trump and delayed them for a month.\n",
      "The tariffs were paused for a month after Trump struck separate last-minute deals with his Mexican and Canadian counterparts. Before those deals were struck, both Canada and Mexico had promised to impose retaliatory tariffs, setting up a trade war which could dramatically impact on the US economy. \"We're on time with the tariffs, and it seems like that's moving along very rapidly,\" the US president said at a White House news conference with French President Emmanuel Macron. While Trump was answering a question about the taxes to be charged on America's two largest trading partners, he also stressed more broadly that his intended \"reciprocal\" tariffs were on schedule to begin as soon as April. Read more: Ukraine war could end ‘within weeks’ Trump claims as he warns it ‘may lead to WW3’ if not stopped \"The tariffs are going forward on time, on schedule,\" Trump said. The US president has claimed that other countries charge unfair import taxes that have come at the expense of domestic manufacturing and jobs. His near constant threats of tariffs have already raised concerns among businesses and consumers about an economic slowdown and accelerating inflation. But Trump claims that the import taxes would ultimately generate revenues to reduce the federal budget deficit and new jobs for workers. \"Our country will be extremely liquid and rich again,\" Trump said. He has already imposed a 10% tax on China, to which Beijing responded with a retaliatory tariff which experts have warned could rapidly escalate into a trade war between the superpowers. The US is the largest importer of goods in the world, with Mexico, China and Canada as its top three suppliers, according to the most recent Census data. The countries also represent huge export markets for the US. This is why the tariffs are predicted to have dramatic effects on the US economy and set up a trade war between the three countries, who are currently protected by the US-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement.

Number two are the drugs, fentanyl and everything else that have come into the country. Number three are the massive subsidies that we’re giving to Canada and to Mexico in the form of deficits,” he said. The tariffs were postponed after both countries announced plans to strengthen their policies on controlling their shared borders with the US. Trump insists tariffs are paid by the country they are imposed on, but this is not true - tariffs are paid by American companies that import goods and services from those countries. The companies then usually pass their higher costs on to their consumers, which raises prices for the average American citizen. However, they might impact Canada and Mexico too, as their products become more expensive to sell in the American market. But Trump showed no concern that import taxes on the United States' trading partners would have a negative impact on the US economy, despite the risk shown in many economic analyses of higher prices.

We have all the trees you need, meaning the lumber.\" The president also said that China would pay tariffs for its exporting of the chemicals used to make fentanyl. He has previously stated a 10% tariff that would be on top of other import taxes charged on products from China. Trump said Beijing has failed to prevent fentanyl and chemicals associated with the deadly drug from entering the US, which he said they promised him. “With China, I’m also thinking about something because they’re sending fentanyl into our country, and because of that, they’re causing us hundreds of thousands of deaths,” Trump said Thursday. “So China is going to end up paying a tariff also for that, and we’re in the process of doing that.” The US President said he is still considering whether to include oil from those countries as part of his import taxes. \"We may or may not,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. \"We're going to make that determination probably tonight.\" Trump said his decision will be based on whether the price of oil charged by the two trading partners is fair. After he made his comments, the US dollar reached a daily high, while the Canadian dollar and Mexican peso both plunged. The United States imported almost 4.6 million barrels of oil daily from Canada in October and 563,000 barrels from Mexico, according to the Energy Information Administration. US daily production during that month averaged nearly 13.5 million barrels a day.\n",

      "Clint Hill, the US secret service agent who leapt onto the back of John F Kennedy's limousine after the president was shot, has died aged 93.\n",
      "Mr Hill, who was forced to retire early because he remained haunted by memories of the assassination for most of his life, died at home in Belvedere, California, his publisher said. A cause of death was not given. Although few may recognise his name, the footage of Mr Hill, captured on Abraham Zapruder's chilling home movie of the assassination, provided some of the most indelible images of Kennedy's assassination in Dallas on November 22 1963. Mr Hill received secret service awards and was promoted for his actions that day, but for decades blamed himself for Mr Kennedy's death, saying he did not react quickly enough and would gladly have given his life to save the president. \"If I had reacted just a little bit quicker. And I could have, I guess,\" a weeping Mr Hill told Mike Wallace on CBS' 60 Minutes in 1975, shortly after he retired aged 43 at the urging of his doctors. \"And I'll live with that to my grave.\" It was only in recent years that Mr Hill said he was able to finally start putting the assassination behind him and accept what happened. On the day of the assassination, Mr Hill was assigned to protect first lady Jacqueline Kennedy, and was riding on the left running board of the follow-up car directly behind the presidential limousine as it made its way through Dealey Plaza. Mr Hill told the Warren Commission that he reacted after hearing a shot and seeing the president slump in his seat. The president was struck by a fatal headshot before Mr Hill was able to make it to the limousine. Mr Zapruder's film captured Mr Hill as he leapt from the secret service car, grabbed a handle on the limousine's boot and pulled himself onto it as the driver accelerated. He forced Mrs Kennedy, who had crawled onto the boot, back into her seat as the limousine sped off. Mr Hill later became the agent in charge of the White House protective detail and eventually an assistant director of the secret service, retiring because of what he characterised as deep depression and recurring memories of the assassination. The 1993 Clint Eastwood thriller In The Line Of Fire, about a former secret service agent scarred by the JFK assassination, was inspired in part by Mr Hill.\n",

      "US President Donald Trump said the Ukraine war ‘could end within weeks’ but warned it ‘could lead to World War III’ if it’s not stopped, as he hosted French president Emmanuel Macron in the White House.\n",
      "The war in Ukraine “could end within weeks,” Donald Trump told reporters at a joint press conference with Emmanuel Macron at the Oval Office. But the US president also warned that the war 'could turn into World War III' if it is not stopped, saying it is in the best interest of Ukraine and Russia to 'stop the killing now'. Trump repeated his claim that the war \"would never have started if I was president\".

A meeting with Putin is also on the cards ‘at some point’, the president said, while confirming he \"does not see a problem with sending European troops as peacemakers,” a plan suggested by Sir Keir Starmer. Emmanuel Macron, standing next to Trump, said US re-engagement \"is a source of uncertainty for Putin\", adding that France is \"ready to provide security guarantees to Ukraine\". The two heads of state agreed that European nations should 'take a central role in the long term security of Ukraine', as Macron said \"Europeans need to do more\" and \"more fairly share the burden\" of security in Europe. \"This peace must not mean a surrender of Ukraine or a ceasefire without of guarantees, it must allow for Ukrainian sovereignty and allow Ukraine to negotiate with other stakeholders regarding the issues that affects it,\" the French president said. \"It is also a country in which we need to shoulder our responsibilities so that we ensure security and stability for Ukraine and for the entire region,\" he added. \"For Europeans this is an existential issue.\" Macron is the first European leader to visit Trump since his inauguration just over a month ago, as relations between European nations and the US come under increased strain. Earlier on Monday, Trump said he was having ‘serious discussions’ with Putin on ending the Ukraine war, and that he hopes to sign a controversial $500bn minerals deal with Ukraine ‘very soon’. The proposed minerals deal would see Ukraine trade the country's valuable natural resources in exchange for US weapons that they have received in the past, as well as future US security assistance. Read more: 'Russia doesn't hold all the cards', Starmer says, as he tells Ukraine 'we are with you' three years on from invasion The US president also hinted that he and Putin are discussing a form of trade, saying they have talked about ‘major Economic Development transactions’ between the US and Russia. “I am in serious discussions with President Vladimir Putin of Russia concerning the ending of the War, and also major Economic Development transactions which will take place between the United States and Russia,” Trump posted on his social media platform Truth Social. The US president added: “Talks are proceeding very well!” The relationship between the US and Europe has become increasingly fragile after Donald Trump began negotiating with Russian president Vladimir Putin to end the war in Ukraine, excluding Kyiv from the talks. Trump later heavily criticised Ukrainian leader Zelenskyy, calling him a 'dictator’ and suggesting he started the war in Ukraine - which is untrue. He also scrutinised other European leaders, including Sir Keir Starmer, for failing to end the war Russia started by invading Ukraine in 2022.

Friedrich Merz, the chancellor-in-waiting said: \"After the latest statements made by Donald Trump last week... this administration mostly don't care about the fate of Europe one way or another,\" at a televised debate after the election.\n",

      "Volodymyr Zelenskyy hopes to \"finish the war this year\", in address to G7 countries to mark the third anniversary of Russia’s invasion.  The Ukrainian leader announced his ambition when asked about hopes for his country and people. This comes as the US abstained from voting on the UN Ukraine resolution on Monday. The resolution urged an end to the fighting in Ukraine, but the US wanted to change the resolution to leave out mention of Russian aggression. Trump's administration put their version of the resolution to the UN on Friday, pitting it against Ukraine the EU allies who have spent weeks negotiating their own resolution.   The UN meeting comes amid ever-rising tensions in Europe, with the US seemingly abandoning its support for Zelenskyy’s embattled country. Sir Keir Starmer has pledged his support for Ukraine “today and every day” as he spoke with Zelenskyy today. The Prime Minister reaffirmed that Britain is ready to commit British troops on the ground in Ukraine in order to maintain peace. \"I have a very simple, clear message today, the UK is with you today and every day, from His Majesty the King to the NHS workers volunteering in hospitals in Ukraine to the communities that took Ukrainian refugees to their heart,” the PM said. Hitting back at comments made by President Trump that Ukraine has “no cards left to play”, Starmer said: “Russia does not hold all the cards in this war.

And Ukraine must be included in peace talks, Starmer said, a stark contrast to President Trump’s disregard for Zelenskyy. He said: “If we want peace to endure, Ukraine must have a seat at the table. “And any settlement must be based on a sovereign Ukraine.\"\n",

A misconduct hearing last week heard that his behaviour was \"unacceptable\". “DC Irikefe has shown an unacceptable pattern of behaviour at football matches, for anyone, let alone a police officer who should uphold the highest of standards whether on or off duty,\" said Detective Superintendent Emma Bond, in charge of policing for the Central South area. The hearing found he had breached the standards of professional behaviour for discreditable conduct at the level of gross misconduct. Arsenal supporter DC Irikefe was also arrested by German police, at the Bayern Munich v Arsenal match, for wearing a full balaclava and sunglasses inside the stadium. The officer attended Westminster Magistrates’ Court today in relation to his disorderly and anti-social behaviour at Arsenal matches between October 2022 and April 2024. He has been heard 'tragedy' chanting at a Leicester City march, shouting 'helicopter', in reference to a helicopter crash that killed five people - including Leicester City club owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha. Other allegations included making lewd gestures, shouting abuse at players, and intimidating other fans. Reports claim that he wore a mask to conceal his identity at matches.

He cannot go within one mile of the Emirates stadium if Arsenal are playing four hours before and after the match, nor visit any town, city or London borough four hours before and after an away match. He must not go without two miles of any stadium where the England national team are playing four hours before and after the match.\n",

      "\n",
      "The space rock, known as asteroid 2024 YR4, has caused panic in recent weeks after NASA upgraded the chance it could collide with Earth to a stomach-churning one in 32. 2024 YR4 has been likened to the size of Big Ben and could decimate a city if it were to hit Earth. But in a rare piece of good news, the space rock has been downgraded to Level 0 on the Torino scale and only has an extremely small chance of hitting Earth. Read more: NASA makes 'emergency' decision over asteroid the size of Big Ben that could strike Earth Read more: Earth to gain second 'moon' for nearly two months as asteroid expected to enter orbit NASA’s most recent observation now puts the chance of an impact at a more comforting 0.0039 per cent, or 1 in 26,000. Describing Level 0 of the Torino scale, NASA said: \"The likelihood of a collision is zero, or is so low as to be effectively zero.” \"It is perfectly natural that the impact chances for asteroid 2024 YR4 will bounce around a bit,\" Richard P. Binzel, inventor of the Torino Impact Hazard Scale told IFLScience today. \"While certainty for 2024 YR4 missing the Earth is the outcome we expect, it's not up to us. It's for nature to decide. In fact, nature already has settled the question. We just don't know that answer yet. That's why the tracking efforts continue.\" David Rankin, a scientist at NASA's Catalina Sky Survey Project, has projected a \"risk corridor\" for the asteroid that shows a large stretch of the Earth that could be hit. The \"risk corridor\" stretches from South America, across the Pacific Ocean, across south Asia, the Arabian Sea and Africa. Specific countries that may face impact include Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Sudan and Nigeria. Where it may eventually end up hitting would depend on the rotation of the Earth at the moment of impact. Meanwhile, an international team are using the James Webb Space Telescope to determine the damage it could do. The Tunguska asteroid, hitting Siberia in 1908, was also similar size and destroyed 830 square miles of forest. 2024 YR4 was first discovered in December 2024 by the Asteroid Terrestial-impact Last Alert System station in Chile, funded by NASA. Back then, it only had a 1.3 percent probability of hitting Earth but it was still the top of NASA's risk list. It is estimated that the asteroid could flatten structures for up to two miles in any direction from the impact size. Determining the size of the asteroid involves looking at it through a powerful telescope, and figuring out the size through the brightness of the light reflected from its surface. A spokesperson from the European Space Agency said, to the Daily Mail: \"Astronomers around the world are using powerful telescopes to measure the asteroid’s orbit as accurately as possible. But knowing its orbit will only tell us the asteroid could impact Earth, not how significant an impact could be. \"It is very important that we improve our size estimate for 2024 YR4: the hazard represented by a 40 m asteroid is very different from that of a 90 m asteroid,\" ESA added. The James Webb Space Telescope will solve this problem, as it uses infrared sensors to look at the heat radiating off the asteroid - giving them a more accurate estimate of size.\n",

      "The Prime Minister has called on the US to provide a \"backstop\" to deter Russia from attacking Ukraine again. He added that the fate of Ukraine is an \"existential question\" for Europe as a whole and that it is time to \"take responsibility\" for its security.  \t The PM is at the Elysee Palace, Paris, for emergency talks with European leaders about the war in Ukraine.  \t It comes amid US president Donald Trump's push for a deal with Russia's Vladimir Putin. The PM said: \"I spoke to President Zelensky on Friday and will do so again in coming days and we envisage a further meeting with European colleagues when I return from the US.  \t \"In this moment we have to recognise the new era that we are in, not cling hopelessly to the comforts of the past.  \t \"It's time for us to take responsibility for our security, for our continent and I've been clear today Britain will take a leading responsibility, as we always have, because Ukraine must have a secure future, Europe must have a secure future, Britain must have a secure future and democratic values must prevail.\" Speaking after the meeting of leaders in Paris on Monday, he said: \"At stake is not just the future of Ukraine. It is an existential question for Europe as a whole, and therefore vital for Britain's national interest.  \t \"This is a once in a generation moment for the collective security of our own continent. Only a lasting peace in Ukraine that safeguards its sovereignty will deter Putin from further aggression in the future.  \t \"Recent statements by the US administration should not come as a surprise. President Trump has long expressed the wish for Europe to step up and meet the demands of its own security, that he wants to get a lasting peace agreement to end the war in Ukraine.  \t Read more: More than 1.1m homes sitting empty across England as thousands left at risk of homelessness  Read more: Pope to remain in hospital with infection as doctors tackle 'complex clinical picture' \"So today's informal meeting of European leaders was a vital first step in responding to that. On defence, it's clear the US is not going to leave Nato, but we Europeans will have to do more.   \"The issue of burden-sharing is not new, but it is now pressing, and Europeans will have to step up, both in terms of spending and the capabilities that we provide.  \t \"On Ukraine, we're at the very early stage of the process. Europe must play its role, and I'm prepared to consider committing British forces on the ground alongside others if there is a lasting peace agreement.  \t \"But there must be a US backstop, because a US security guarantee is the only way to effectively deter Russia from attacking Ukraine again.\" It comes just a week before the Prime Minister is to fly to the US for talks with Donald Trump as part of a visit announced earlier on Monday as the US president pushes for a deal with Russia amid fears of Kyiv remaining excluded from discussions. Sir Keir is unlikely to go beyond his commitment to set out a plan to increase defence spending to a 2.5% share of the economy, despite calls from Mr Trump to hike spending to 5% and Nato secretary general Mark Rutte's suggestion that allies should spend more than 3%.  \t The UK currently spends around 2.3% of gross national product on defence.  \t Earlier on Monday, Downing Street did not rule out the prospect of a vote on the matter of a peacekeeping role for UK troops in Ukraine.  \t Labour MP Clive Lewis called for a debate in Parliament on the issue, saying it was \"incumbent\" on the Prime Minister to allow for a broader discussion on the move.  \t He told the PA news agency: \"This commitment could put British troops in harm's way.  \t \"It's incumbent on the Prime Minister to have a broader discussion with the public, involving Parliament.\"\n",

      "Britain should send two warships, a combat brigade and air squadron to Ukraine to show \"UK leadership\", a former armed forces minister has told LBC.\n",
      "James Heappey welcomed Sir Keir Starmer's commitment to put British troops on the ground as part of a future peacekeeping mission. It comes as the PM is heading to Paris this morning for an emergency summit on Ukraine's future - as the US and Russians head to Saudi Arabia for talks on a peace deal. He's said he \"doesn't take the decision lightly\" to commit British troops overseas. Read more: Peace in Ukraine 'vital for Britain's freedom', says Streeting as he backs PM's calls for troops on the ground Read more: Zelenskyy visits UAE as Starmer signals support for British troop deployment in Ukraine peacekeeping But Mr Heappey said that Britain needed to spend far more on defence to make that work. He told LBC: \"Keir Starmer's apparent commitment to troops in Ukraine as part of the post war security force is really welcome. I think he should be looking at probably a combat brigade, a combat air squadron and a commitment of probably around two warships permanently deployed in the Black Sea. That would feel like a meaningful commitment by the UK and really demonstrate the UK's leadership in this new European security order.\" And he urged the PM to keep the current troops we've committed to NATO where they are right now, with the same size of the army, navy and air force. Ministers are conducting a strategic defence review into the future of our armed forces and what they might need in future. Labour vowed to spend 2.5% of GDP on defence - but haven't put a timeline on when they'll do it. But LBC's been told they're still not agreed on how much to spend, and what to spend it on. And they're facing calls to go even higher too. Mr Heappey added: \"Whatever we want to do in Ukraine is going to require more and that means more defence spending. \"The number that is needed in order to be able to do everything that we need to do for NATO and take a leadership role in Ukraine and look after our interests globally is at least three and a half percent of GDP. \"And frankly, going to Paris and committing troops while still telling NATO that you're going to do everything that you promised them to do without making that commitment around defence spending is pretty, is pretty inconsistent and isn't going to work.\"\n",

      "UK employers are readying for mass redundancies amid collapsing business confidence, in what's been described as the biggest round of layoffs in nearly a decade.\n",
      "Reports of firms preparing for mass layoffs come as UK businesses brace for major tax hikes from April, following Rachel Reeves' plans for National Insurance hikes for employers in her autumn budget. Figures released by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD), which represents HR professionals, said a recent survey of 2,000 employers revealed planned redundancies had hit their highest level in 10 years. The figures exclude redundancies that came as a result of the Covid pandemic. The CIPD survey, which was carried out in the second half of January, found that most employers blamed the rise in employer NI contributions, alongside a 6.7% increase in the “national living wage”. It added that its study highlighted the Government's need to accelerate its business support plans and skills policy. A third of businesses that expect their employment costs to increase said they plan to reduce their headcount through redundancies or recruiting fewer workers - and two in five warned they will raise prices. Peter Cheese, chief executive at the CIPD, said: \"These are the most significant downward changes in employer sentiment we've seen in the last 10 years, outside of the pandemic. \"Employer confidence has been impacted by planned changes to employment costs, and employment indicators are heading in the wrong direction. Read more: 'I'm ready to put British troops into Ukraine', Keir Starmer says ahead of emergency Paris summit Read More: 'Laughing' Syrian asylum seeker who stabbed boy, 14, to death was motivated by 'Islamic terrorism' \"Businesses have had time to digest these impending changes, with many now planning to reduce headcount, raise prices and cut investment in workforce training. \"If the Government's plans are to succeed, it's vital they set out how they will help businesses to support growth and investment, and it's important this support is felt across the economy. \"Our data shows it's the everyday economy sectors, such as retail and hospitality, which employ large numbers of people, that will be particularly affected by impending increases to employment costs.\" It comes as a separate survey found that confidence among small businesses hit its lowest recorded point outside the Covid pandemic in the fourth quarter of last year. The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) said a survey of almost 1,400 smaller firms found that those in accommodation and food services were the least optimistic. Barriers to growth were said to include the domestic economy, the tax burden and labour costs. Tina McKenzie, of the FSB, said: \"The fourth quarter blues reported by small firms underline how urgently the Government's growth push is needed. \"Small firms are understandably nervous about their prospects as 2025 gets under way. \"The upcoming Employment Rights Bill is a major source of stress for small firms, with nine in 10 business owners saying they are concerned about its introduction, and this is undoubtedly a major cause of the very subdued confidence levels seen in our research. \"On the plus side, the Government's plans to reduce late payment - a perennial source of financial pain and misery to small firms - cannot come soon enough.\" Paul Nowak, general secretary of the TUC, said: \"Many of the warnings being issued against the Employment Rights Bill are the same discredited ones that were voiced against the introduction of the minimum wage 25 years ago. They were wrong then and they are wrong now. \"We cannot continue with the same broken status quo. \"Britain's low pay, low rights economic model has been terrible for living standards and growth over the last 14 years. \"The Government's workers' rights plans are common sense reforms that will drive up labour market participation, improve health, raise productivity - and put more money into people's pockets. \"They are good for workers, business and the wider economy.\"\n",

      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting has told LBC peace in Ukraine is vital for \"Britain's freedom and security\" as he backed the Prime Minister's calls to put troops on the ground.\n",
      "Speaking to LBC's Nick Ferrari, Streeting said that the Sir Keir Starmer's commitment is not to be taken lightly.  He said: \"I do believe strongly, as does the Prime Minister, that Ukraine as the frontline, not just the Ukrainian defence freedom and security but for Britain's freedom and security as well and for the whole continent.\" Streeting added: \"What the Prime Minister is saying is that as well as securing an end to the war we need to secure the peace.\" It comes after the Sir Keir  said he is \"ready and willing\" to deploy British soldiers as part of security guarantees offered in any peace deal.  The Prime Minister said Britain - and Europe - were facing a 'once in a generation moment' for their security. Writing for The Telegraph, he revealed he believes the UK can play a crucial role in peace negotiations, bridging the gap between the US and Europe. He said: \"Securing a lasting peace in Ukraine that safeguards its sovereignty for the long term is essential if we are to deter Putin from further aggression in the future.\" Sir Keir said that he will attend an emergency summit in Paris on Monday with a \"very clear message for our European friends\". He stressed he was aware of the \"responsibility that comes with potentially putting British servicemen and women in harm’s way\". The PM continued: \"Any role in helping to guarantee Ukraine’s security is helping to guarantee the security of our continent, and the security of this country.\" He said: \"We have got to show we are truly serious about our own defence and bearing our own burden. We have talked about it for too long – and President Trump is right to demand that we get on with it. \"As European nations, we must increase our defence spending and take on a greater role in NATO. Non-US NATO nations have already increased defence spending by 20 per cent in the past year, but we must go further.\" He urged European nations to 'step up'. Starmer noted Donald Trump's peace efforts, and said: \"US support will remain critical and a US security guarantee is essential for a lasting peace, because only the US can deter Putin from attacking again. \"So I will be meeting President Trump in the coming days and working with him and all our G7 partners to help secure the strong deal we need.\" Read more: Southport killer Axel Rudakubana's sentence won't be referred to Court of Appeal despite claims it's 'unduly lenient' Read More: 'Laughing' Syrian asylum seeker who stabbed boy, 14, to death was motivated by 'Islamic terrorism' US President Donald Trump has said President Putin wants to \"stop fighting\" in Ukraine. Meanwhile, a senior Ukrainian government source has said that Kyiv has not been invited to US-Russia peace negotiations in Saudi Arabia this week. European leaders have yet to be invited to peace talks either, and will discuss their next move at the Paris summit chaired by French President Emmanuel Macron. The Ukrainian source told the BBC that no delegation would be present at the Russia-Ukraine peace talks. On Sunday, when asked about President Zelenskyy's presence at possible negotiations, Trump said: \"He will be involved\". The turbulent week of discussion comes as leaders met at the Munich Security Conference to discuss peace in Europe.  Earlier on Sunday, the former Prime Minister of Ukraine told LBC the West must be united in boosting defence spending and supporting Ukraine if it wants peace. Speaking to Iain Dale, Arseniy Yatsenyuk compared US Vice President JD Vance’s speech at the Munich defence summit to rhetoric espoused by Vladimir Putin as he pleaded with America to reaffirm its commitment to NATO and Ukraine. “Things are going in the wrong direction right now,” Yatsenyuk said. “The free world has to stay united but the latest speech by JD Vance resembles one given by war criminal Putin. “Americans have to change their approach and the way they’ve decided to handle Ukrainian and European issues, which are actually the same. “This is a huge challenge for the European Union, a huge challenge for Ukraine and a huge challenge for the United Kingdom and we have to face it,” he added. “But, I believe this could be a wake-up call for the EU and lead them to a more strong, bold and clear-cut decision. And the summit being held in Paris can jumpstart this.” Mr Yatsenyuk insisted that Europe can only have peace by investing heavily in defence.\n",

      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy arrived in the UAE late on Sunday after attending the Munich Security Conference, as speculation grows over potential peace talks to end Russia's war on Ukraine.\n",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has said he is prepared to send British troops to Ukraine as part of a peacekeeping force if a deal is reached to end the war with Russia.  He confirmed that the UK is \"ready and willing\" to support Ukraine’s security and pledged £3bn annually in military aid until 2030. His comments come ahead of an emergency summit in Paris on Monday, led by French President Emmanuel Macron. The hastily arranged meeting will bring together European leaders, including German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, and NATO chief Mark Rutte.  The discussions aim to \"bring together all partners interested in peace and security in Europe\" following US-led negotiations with Russia in Saudi Arabia, from which European leaders have been excluded. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived in the United Arab Emirates late on Sunday, following the Munich Security Conference in Germany.  Read more: 'I'm ready to put British troops into Ukraine', Keir Starmer says ahead of emergency Paris summit Read more: Europe must ‘work closely’ with US to face Russia, Labour MP tells LBC ahead of emergency Ukraine summit His visit comes as discussions about a potential peace settlement intensify. The UAE has previously played a key role in prisoner exchanges and has been floated as a possible negotiation site due to its significant Russian and Ukrainian expatriate populations. Zelensky’s trip prioritises securing prisoner releases, economic partnerships, and humanitarian aid, according to his office.  However, his arrival in Abu Dhabi was not immediately reported by state media, and his agenda remains unclear.  His visit coincides with the International Defence Exhibition and Conference, where both Ukraine and Russia are displaying military hardware despite Western sanctions on Moscow. At the same time, the US and Russian officials are set to meet in Saudi Arabia to discuss potential peace talks. While a Ukrainian delegation is in the country, Mykhailo Podolyak, a top adviser to Zelensky, has publicly dismissed the idea of Ukraine engaging in negotiations, saying, \"There is nothing on the negotiating table that would be worth discussing.\" Meanwhile President Donald Trump, speaking in Florida on Sunday, claimed that Russian President Vladimir Putin \"wants to stop fighting\" and suggested he would soon meet with him to discuss a potential deal.  Trump has promised Zelensky a seat at the table, but European leaders remain uncertain about their role in the process. Zelensky’s UAE visit also coincides with Russian Deputy Prime Minister Denis Manturov’s trip to the country, where he met with UAE President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan to discuss strengthening Russia-UAE ties.  Russian money continues to flow into Dubai’s property market, despite concerns raised by the US Treasury. With European leaders pushing to shape Ukraine’s post-war future and the US engaging in separate discussions with Russia, the geopolitical landscape is shifting rapidly.  However, uncertainty remains over the direction of negotiations and Ukraine’s role in determining its own peace process.\n",

      "The Labour MP behind the UK's proposed assisted dying legislation has asked critics not to kill her Bill in the parliamentary process before MPs have a chance to vote.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kim Leadbeater told The Independent she understood she had \"weeks and weeks\" of work ahead after the  Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill committee scrutinised the proposal line-by-line. \"What I wouldn't want to see would be that people do try and put so many amendments in that we don't end up getting to third reading,\" she said. \"But most MPs I've spoken to this week understand the parliamentary process.\" Parliamentary process allows amendments to be made throughout a Bill's passage, provided they do not deal with sections of legislation that have already been discussed. The Labour MP also warned that situations where people go abroad to end their lives with no scrutiny leave the door open for unethical situations. Read more: 'I'm ready to put British troops into Ukraine', Keir Starmer says ahead of emergency Paris summit \"You've got people now who are terminally ill who are taking their own lives,\" she explained. \"You've got people going to Dignitas, and we have no idea whether they've been coerced into it.\" Ms Leadbeater weathered a storm last week over proposed changes that would scrap requirements for a high court judge to hear an application in court, instead replacing it with a panel of experts.  \"I think with those MPs who have genuine concerns, including me, we've got to get it right,\" she said. Labour opponents of the assisted dying Bill have said scrutiny of the legislation \"feels chaotic\" following the announcement of a major change to the proposals before Parliament.  Read more: ‘If you want peace, pay for it', says ex-Ukrainian PM as Starmer to 'overrule' Reeves and boost defence spending Ms Leadbeater announced last week she will bring forward amendments that would replace a High Court judge's oversight of the process with an expert panel including psychiatrists and social workers. The MP said the move would strengthen the legislation following concerns expressed during expert evidence sessions last month. But in a statement issued last week, 10 of her Labour colleagues said the \"promise of High Court scrutiny of each application for assisted dying\" had been a central part of Ms Leadbeater's pitch to MPs at the end of last year. The group, all of whom voted against the Bill when it first came before the Commons in November, said: \"Supporters of the Bill insisted that it was a key part of the protections for vulnerable and marginalised people. \"Yet despite repeated assurances until just days ago the proponents of the Bill have changed their argument - and fundamentally changed the Bill.  \"All MPs have an important job to do to make sure that the assisted dying Bill is fit for purpose. Yet the process feels chaotic, with the Bill changing significantly from what was presented to Parliament at second reading.\" Senior Labour MPs Florence Eshalomi and Dame Meg Hillier put their names to the statement, alongside Antonia Bance, Jess Asato, James Frith, Paulette Hamilton, Adam Jogee, David Smith, Yasmin Qureshi and Melanie Ward.\n",

Everyone must realise, that if we want to live in peace, we have to pay for it.” “We have to pay for our military, we have to boost the military-industrial complex and we have to make united efforts inside NATO and we are not allowed to be outplayed by war criminal Putin. “That’s why I am pleading with the United States to take their position in the game again. Otherwise, they will lose their position as the leader of the free world. “Everything depends on where the US stands on the Ukrainian war and it has to stand with Ukraine and with its European partners.” It comes as Sir Keir Starmer is set to travel to Paris next week to join European leaders at an emergency defence summit called by French President Emmanuel Macron. European allies will discuss being left out of peace negotiations between Russia and the United States over the war in Ukraine. Now, according to The Times, Starmer will overrule his chancellor and call for increased defence spending in a bid to woo Donald Trump before he flies to Washington to meet the president. Downing Street has maintained plans to boost defence spending since Labour entered power last year but has yet to give a timetable as to when they will reach their goal of 2.5% of GDP. Starmer reportedly held one-to-one meetings the Ministry of Defence on Friday, speaking with Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, the chief of the defence staff, and the respective heads of the army, RAF and Royal Navy. They want the PM to commit to raising spending to 2.65% of GDP - a move becoming ever more likely as tensions in Europe reach boiling point. Raising the MoD budget to 2.65%, however, would cost around $10billion and put a significant dent in Ms Reeves’ spending power. This comes after the PM warned of a “once in a generation moment for our national security” ahead of the emergency summit next week. Speaking on Saturday night, he said: “This is a once in a generation moment for our national security where we engage with the reality of the world today and the threat we face from Russia.\" \"It’s clear Europe must take a greater role in NATO as we work with the United States to secure Ukraine’s future and face down the threat we face from Russia. The UK will work to ensure we keep the US and Europe together.\" \"We cannot allow any divisions in the alliance to distract from the external enemies we face.” The summit is thought to be taking place in Paris on Monday. It comes as US Special Presidential Envoy for Ukraine and Russia - Keith Kellogg - has said that Europe will not have a final say in the conflict's resolution. When asked at the Munich Security Conference if Europe will be included in talks, Kellogg said: \"That is not going to happen.\" He added: \"To my European friends, I would say: get into the debate, not by complaining that you might, yes or no, be at the table, but by coming up with concrete proposals, ideas, ramp up spending.\" Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said there is \"no time to lose\". Speaking at the conference, he said: \"Europe urgently needs its own plan of action concerning Ukraine and our security, or else other global players will decide about our future. Not necessarily in line with our own interest. \"This plan must be prepared now\". Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy added: \"I believe the time has come to create an armed forces of Europe. Money alone will not stop an enemy assault. \"It is not just about budgets, it is about people realising they need to defend their own home. He went on: \"Decisions about Europe are made in Europe.\" Referencing Donald Trump's plan to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin, he continued: \"Ukraine will never accept deals made behind our backs without our involvement, and the same rule should apply to all of Europe, \"A few days ago, President Trump told me about his conversation with Putin. Not once did he mention that America needs Europe at the table. That says a lot. \"The old days are over when America supported Europe just because it always had.\"\n",

When asked at the Munich Security Conference if Europe will be included in talks, Kellogg said: \"That is not going to happen.\" He added: \"To my European friends, I would say: get into the debate, not by complaining that you might, yes or no, be at the table, but by coming up with concrete proposals, ideas, ramp up spending.\" Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said there is \"no time to lose\". Speaking at the conference, he said: \"Europe urgently needs its own plan of action concerning Ukraine and our security, or else other global players will decide about our future. Not necessarily in line with our own interest. \"This plan must be prepared now\". Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy added: \"I believe the time has come to create an armed forces of Europe. Money alone will not stop an enemy assault. \"It is not just about budgets, it is about people realising they need to defend their own home. He went on: \"Decisions about Europe are made in Europe.\" Referencing Donald Trump's plan to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin, he continued: \"Ukraine will never accept deals made behind our backs without our involvement, and the same rule should apply to all of Europe, \"A few days ago, President Trump told me about his conversation with Putin. Not once did he mention that America needs Europe at the table. That says a lot. \"The old days are over when America supported Europe just because it always had.\"\n",

      "Rachel Reeves has defended herself over allegations she was subject to an investigation linked to expenses while working at a major UK retail bank, saying she was \"never questioned\" over the claims.\n",
      "Speaking for the first time since questions were raised over the expenses earlier this week, the Chancellor said she was never approached over concerns. Reeves worked as a senior manager at Halifax Bank of Scotland between 2006 and 2009, with new claims suggesting she was subject to a detailed whistleblowing complaint while working there. The concerns are said to relate to her use of company money to \"fund a lifestyle\" - these included a £400 leaving meal for a colleague, a £49 handbag for her PA and perfume purchased as a present for her boss. Speaking with LBC on Friday, Reeves confirmed \"no problems were ever raised during my time\" a the bank, with the Chancellor defending herself from claims she was the subject of an investigation into her expenses. \"People will judge me for the role that I perform as Chancellor,\" she said. Her first comments since suggestions emerged, the Chancellor said: \"No-one ever raised any concerns about my expenses.\" \"But in the end, I think people will judge me for the role that I perform as Chancellor. Getting our economy growing, putting more money in working people's pockets and building the one and a half million homes that this government has committed to do and I'm determined to do as Chancellor of the Exchequer.\" She Insisted her expenses had been submitted and approved \"in the proper way\".

Asked by LBC for further details, Reeves said: \"Well, I worked at the Bank of England as an economist between 2000 and 2006.  \"I worked then in financial services for Halifax Bank of Scotland. Those are the roles that I did before becoming an MP, and I'm proud of the jobs that I did in both of those institutions.\" On Thursday, the BBC reported that Ms Reeves and two colleagues at HBOS had been investigated over their expenses, with an initial inquiry suggesting they appeared to have broken the bank's rules, but it was unclear what happened next. It is alleged that Ms Reeves was one of a number of HBOS staff who made \"excessive\" purchases such as handbags and perfume for their colleagues using \"motivation cards\" provided by the bank to allow employees to reward high-performing staff, as well as expenses claims. In a statement, former HBOS HR manager Jane Wayper, who left the bank in 2008 according to her LinkedIn page, said she did not \"recognise\" any of the claims. Ms Wayper said; \"I would have been made aware of any investigation which concluded there was a case to answer. I would have been required to organise and oversee a disciplinary process. \"This did not happen.\" David Sorensen, a lawyer who acted for the Chancellor as she left HBOS, said she was not subject to \"allegations of wrongdoing or misconduct\" during her career at the bank. He was responsible for overseeing \"a standard-style agreement adopted by the company when a mutually agreed exit was made during the bank's restructure\". Answering questions during a visit to a building site in Nottinghamshire, the Chancellor also declined to be drawn on claims she had exaggerated the length of time she worked at the Bank of England prior to joining HBOS. The BBC reported that Ms Reeves's LinkedIn profile listed her time at the Bank of England as lasting for months longer than it did. Ms Reeves's team said the inaccuracy was due to an administrative error by the member of staff who set up the profile. Asked about the claims on Thursday, the Chancellor said she was \"proud of the work that I did before I became an MP\" but people would \"judge me on the job I'm doing now as Chancellor of the Exchequer\".\n",

      "Sir Keir Starmer backed Rachel Reeves as she came under pressure over inaccuracies in her CV and her use of expenses in a previous job.\n",
      "The chancellor has been accused by former employees of being involved in an \"expenses scandal\" while working at Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS) from 2006 to 2009. She has also been accused of saying she worked for the Bank of England for longer than she did. Read More: UK economy unexpectedly grew by 0.1% in last quarter of 2024, new figures show Read More: Heathrow expansion can be achieved in 10 years, says Rachel Reeves Ms Reeves has updated her job history on professional networking site LinkedIn to reflect she worked at Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS) for longer than she had previously said. The Chancellor's page had previously suggested her stint at the Bank of England, which she has previously referenced to reinforce her credentials, lasted months longer than it now says. Her use of expenses during her time working for HBOS was also subject to an internal investigation, according to reports, but a spokesperson for Ms Reeves has claimed she was not aware of the probe. A lawyer for the Chancellor, who is MP for Leeds West and Pudsey, has also said she was not subject to \"allegations of wrongdoing or misconduct\" during her career in retail banking. Asked whether he was comfortable with the Chancellor appearing to exaggerate her relevant experience, Sir Keir said on Thursday: \"Rachel Reeves has dealt with any issues that arise. \"She delivered a really important budget for the country that balanced the books, gave us stability, that is beginning to see those interest rates come down, those mortgages coming down as a result - beginning to see some of the growth we need. \"She is determined that we go further with that. She can deal with the issues that arise out of this report many years ago.\" Asked if Ms Reeves could be trusted, the Prime Minister's official spokesman said: \"Yes, the Chancellor is working with the whole of Cabinet to deliver the Plan for Change.\" On whether it would be right to say the Prime Minister does not have any concerns about Ms Reeves' conduct, he said: \"Correct.\" Downing Street said the Chancellor went through a ministerial declaration process like other members of Cabinet when she joined the Government, but the spokesperson would not get into the detail of what was disclosed. Responding to the update to her LinkedIn profile to reflect the changed date of her work with HBOS, a spokesperson for the Chancellor said: \"As Rachel said on Good Morning Britain a couple of weeks ago when she was asked, she worked as an economist at the Bank of England between 2000 and 2006, including over a year at the British Embassy in Washington working in the economics section, and then she worked at HBOS from 2006 to 2009. \"She's proud of the jobs she did and experience she gained before becoming a Member of Parliament.\" The BBC reported HBOS had opened an investigation into the spending culture of the department at the bank where Ms Reeves worked. A whistleblower complained she and two senior colleagues' use of expenses was excessive, according to the broadcaster. One ex-colleague said she nearly got sacked after an investigation into three senior managers accused of \"signing off each other's expenses\". This included spending hundreds of pounds on handbags, perfume, earrings and wine for colleagues, including one gift for her boss. A whistleblower said there was also concern about her spending on taxis and on a Christmas party. In a Facebook group of former HBOS employees seen by the BBC, several people referred to Ms Reeves being investigated over her expenses spending. Ms Reeves' spokesperson said she was \"not aware of an investigation nor was she interviewed, and she did not face any disciplinary action on this or any other matters\". They added: \"All expenses were submitted and signed off in the proper way. \"Several former colleagues from her time at the bank, including HBOS' former HR business partner, have corroborated this account. \"Rachel left HBOS in 2009 on good terms.\" David Sorensen, the lawyer who represented her as she left the bank, said her exit was \"a standard-style agreement adopted by the company when a mutually agreed exit was made during the bank's restructure\". Mr Sorensen, a managing partner at Morrish Solicitors, said: \"My clear understanding at the time was that my client, who was in a senior role, left on good terms when HBOS plc was acquired in 2009, as evidenced by the payments made to her, the retention of her company car and other benefits for a six-month period, and a favourable reference. \"Absolutely no allegations of wrongdoing or misconduct were mentioned by the HBOS HR team during this process.\" Jane Wayper, former HR business partner for HBOS who worked alongside Ms Reeves, also said she did not recognise any of the claims about her former colleague. In a statement, she added: \"In my role, I would have been made aware of any investigation which concluded there was a case to answer. \"I would have been required to organise and oversee a disciplinary process. This did not happen.\" In November, Downing Street defended Ms Reeves's record of being \"straight with the public\" over the nation's finances amid other claims about her CV. Newspapers had contested Ms Reeves's claim in an interview with Stylist magazine in 2021 that she had spent a decade at the Bank of England when her LinkedIn account described it as a six-year period between 2000 and 2006. There was also a reported change to her LinkedIn profile, which lists her \"retail banking\" role at Halifax. Ms Reeves' profile lists her work history from September 2000 onwards. It covers her time as an economist at the Bank of England as well as her role at Halifax. It also details the roles she has had on the Labour frontbench team and her position as an MP since May 2010.\n",

      "The planned visited to the site in Milton Keynes on Thursday was due to see the Prime Minister speak about plans to build new towns in England and promote the economy. However, within moments of his arrival, the PM's voice was drowned out by farmers' tractors sounding their horns. Around 40 tractors gathered at the entrance to the site, with the sound of Darude's \"Sandstorm\" echoing over the PM as he spoke with press. It comes just a day after farmers staged their latest protest in a series of demonstrations in Westminster against Rachel Reeves' proposed inheritance tax hike. Around a dozen agricultural vehicles were seen to block the road near the housing project, with horns heard echoing across the building site. \"Everywhere this man [Starmer] goes, we will be,\" one farmer said. Another added that farmers' anger had reached \"boiling point... it's our last chance saloon to do something\".

A Thames Valley Police spokesman said: \"Thames Valley Police facilitated a peaceful protest off the A509 and liaised with the protesters at the scene. \"Officers from the local policing team engaged with the protesters. \"No arrests were made or necessary,\" the force added. \"The protest has reached its conclusion and the group are now dispersing from the area.\"\n",

      "Angela Rayner has told LBC that that she took advice from NHS trauma specialists ahead of her meeting with Grenfell families and survivors over the demolition of the tower.\n",
      "The Deputy Prime Minister had previously defended her decision to demolish the structure, which was announced during a private meeting with families and survivors last week. The final decision over the fate of the west London tower block divided opinion, with the MP denying she had been \"aggressive\" in her response. Speaking with Andrew Marr on Wednesday, Ms Rayner revealed: \"I took advice from trauma specialists at the NHS there with me to try and give the clear information and to do it in a way that was as less traumatic as it could be, but it was always going to be difficult.\" Some of those who survived and were bereaved by the 2017 fire expressed upset and shock after meeting with Ms Rayner, saying they felt they had not had their views considered before the decision was taken. Asked if she had been worried about delivering the news, Ms Rayner told LBC's Tonight With Andrew Marr: \"I knew it was going to be a really difficult meeting.\" It comes as a petition, started by Grenfell survivor Emma O'Connor and calling for the \"bereaved a proper say on Grenfell's fate\", approached 19,000 signatures on Wednesday.  Ms O'Connor explained on the Change.org petition: \"It’s heartbreaking that this decision is being made without our support or understanding.\" Speaking with Marr on Wednesday, Ms Rayner said: \"Secretary of states before me have not made decisions on the tower, and I think some of that is because it's really difficult, and I knew it was going to be very traumatic to the people.\" She also revealed that she \"knew that there was not a consensus\" among of families, with the final decision always set to divide opinion. \"I'd consulted and spoke to many different people, the bereaved, I spoke to survivors, I spoke to the local head teachers of the schools where the children are still traumatised every day as they're walking around the tower, I spoke to the community, and I knew there wasn't a consensus,\" she told Andrew Marr.

She said she tried to ensure she spoke to bereaved and survivors first, adding: \"What really upsets me about this is these people have been through the most horrendous, horrific experience, lost their loved ones, gone through huge trauma, and the last thing they need is media reports and speculation before they've had the opportunity (to be informed). \"So I was really angered by the fact that some of those leaks were happening.\" It comes days after the housing minister met with King Charles, alongside Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, for a royal tour of a new housing estate.  Charles was accompanied by the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister during three visits in Nansledan, a 540-acre extension to the seaside town of Newquay. The King, dressed in a camel coloured coat, spoke to construction workers as the trio toured the site on Monday, with the group visiting houses, a school and an orchard in in the seaside town.\n",

      "The Deputy Prime Minister has insisted that UK support for Kyiv remains unchanged, despite Donald Trump planning immediate peace talks.\n",
      "Angela Rayner told LBC's Tonight with Andrew Marr that the UK would \"continue to support Ukraine to put them in the best possible position to defend their land\". It came shortly after Mr Trump said that he had spoken to Russian president Vladimir Putin, and that negotiations on ending the three-year war would begin \"immediately\". Mr Trump's Secretary of Defence also warned on Wednesday that European countries would now have to provide \"the overwhelming share of future lethal and non-lethal aid to Ukraine\". The US' reduced support for Ukraine is momentous, as Washington has been the country's main sponsor against the Russian invasion.

But Ms Rayner insisted on Wednesday night that \"we're not going to change our position\", despite Mr Trump's comments. She said: \"We've been really clear, and the previous government was clear on this as well: The illegal war in Ukraine by President Putin is completely unacceptable. We'll continue to support Ukraine to put them in the best possible position to defend their land.  \"And the Prime Minister spoke about this at Prime Minister's questions earlier today. And we're absolutely committed to that. And we'll continue to do that, you know, and we'll continue to work with our allies, whether that's in Europe or in the US, to make sure Putin cannot get away with an illegal war that he's inflicted on the people of Ukraine.\" Asked if Europe on its own can protect Ukraine, the deputy Prime Minister repeated only that the UK would continue its discussions with European allies and the US on the subject, but would not waver in its support for Ukraine.\" Ms Rayner added that she hoped that the US \"will play a part in that.  \"Now, I don't know what part in that that will be, but that will be for the US to decide.\" Ms Rayner would also not be drawn on whether the UK would provide peacekeeping troops to patrol the border in the event of a ceasefire. Earlier, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said that US troops would not be involved in such a role. At a Nato meeting in Brussels earlier in the day, America's defence secretary said Europe should be \"empowered\" to \"own responsibility for its own security\". Mr Trump and Mr Putin spoke for about 90 minutes, according to a Kremlin spokesperson - and the US president is also set to visit Moscow for negotiations on Ukraine. Mr Hegseth also warned that Ukraine's Nato membership plans an \"unrealistic\" prospect. Speaking earlier on Wednesday, he said that Washington would \"no longer tolerate an imbalanced relationship\" with its allies. But Mr Hegseth also said that \"the United States remains committed to the NATO alliance and to the defence partnership with Europe, full stop.\" Earlier, Defence Secretary John Healey sought to play down splits between the UK and Washington and said that \"for now\" allies' focus should be getting Ukraine into a strong position for peace talks. Mr Healey said: \"What he (Mr Hegseth) set out was his commitment, President Trump's commitment, like ours, to see a durable peace to this conflict.\"  \t He added: \"We, as a Nato alliance, to which he also gave the firmest possible continuing commitment, have always been clear that Ukraine's rightful place is in Nato.  \t \"That is a process that will take some time, and for now, our duty, my duty, as a defence minister, the duty of the nations around that table, is to make sure that Ukraine is in the strongest possible position going into any talks in the future.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "In a speech on Wednesday, chief executive Thomas Woldbye will unveil plans to boost capacity of Terminals 2 and 5, improve travel connections and change the layout of the airfield. It comes after Chancellor Rachel Reeves threw her support behind a third runway at Heathrow during a speech on growth last month. Mr Woldbye is expected to say: \"This privately-funded programme will upgrade existing infrastructure while laying the groundwork for a third runway, boosting UK investment and economic growth, with tangible benefits felt this year. \"Heathrow is proud to answer the Chancellor's call to get Britain building.\" Read more: James Cleverly slams 'Orwellian' assisted dying bill as High Court judge sign-off to be scrapped This plan is expected to bring in thousands of British steel jobs, the Government have said. Mr Woldbye will add: \"A third runway is critical for the country's future economic success, and I confirm we will submit our plans for a third runway to Government this summer. \"Ahead of then, as part of a phased expansion programme and supported by the Government's clear backing, I am today confirming multibillion-pound investment plans, 100% privately-funded, to upgrade our terminal buildings, enhance passenger experience, and improve resilience and sustainability. \"This is vital investment and will ensure Heathrow remains globally competitive and a jewel in the country's crown.\" Heathrow will abide by “strict” environmental safeguards during the project, Mr Woldbye is expected to add. He will say: \"This project can only go ahead if we meet the rules on noise, air quality and carbon that the Government sets out in the Airports National Policy Statement - it's as simple as that. \"Even though we're serving more passengers than ever before, our noise footprint is smaller and we're also using more sustainable aviation fuel than ever before. \"I want to assure you that we are committed to listening and working with our local communities to provide them with the certainty they deserve, ending years of doubt.\" The presentation will be made at British Steel's Scunthorpe plant, which is the only facility making primary steel in the UK. He will sign the UK Steel Charter, which aims to maximise supply chain opportunities for UK steel producers. The Department for Business and Trade said it welcomed a \"major vote of confidence from Heathrow in its growth mission after backing a third runway.\" Industry minister Sarah Jones, who is expected to give a keynote speech at the launch event on Wednesday, will say: \"This investment is the latest in a long line of wins which our Plan for Change has helped deliver, and not only secures thousands of jobs but marks a major vote of confidence in our homegrown steel sector and this government's Industrial Strategy. \"Driving demand for UK-made steel is a crucial part of our upcoming Steel Strategy, and by signing the Steel Charter Heathrow will give a huge boost to steelmaking communities across the UK and help us kickstart economic growth.\" Alex Veitch, director of policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \"Expanding airport capacity is a key part of accelerating economic growth - and today's announcement is great news for British business. \"It is real show of support for domestic steel production and supply chains across the UK. As further infrastructure projects are given the green light, many more opportunities can be seized to boost British business and drive forward growth.\" UK Steel director general Gareth Stace said: \"Heathrow signing the UK Steel Charter is a major vote of confidence in UK steelmaking and British businesses full stop. \"With the airport embarking on its largest-ever private investment programme, this commitment unlocks significant opportunities for UK steel producers and supply chains to help deliver critical national infrastructure.\" Campaigners described the planned announcement as \"Orwellian\". Paul McGuinness, chairman of the No 3rd Runway Coalition group, said: \"How bizarre for the government to suggest supporting a project that hasn't even submitted a planning application, and can't be approved until well beyond this parliament's lifetime, will kickstart economic growth. \"As for any construction or purchase of steel, that would be at least over half a decade away, and the project may yet prove uninvestable as several of Heathrow's airline customers have averred. \"The costs of demolishing villages, diverting roads and rivers and tunnelling over the M25's busiest junction, to increase Heathrow's size by an area that is larger than Birmingham International Airport, promises to be inordinately expensive. \"There seems something Orwellian about this announcement, and this is only re-affirmed by its decision to cite a report commissioned by Heathrow itself, as evidence of the project's possible benefits - rather than the government's own Treasury's assessment which concluded that once the 'disbenefits' had been taken into account, the project's maximum economic benefit to the UK would be somewhere between £3.3bn and minus £2.2bn over 60 years.\"This boost to the British steel industry comes just days after President Donald Trump announced crippling 25% tariffs on imports of the material. Speaking from the White House on Monday evening, the US president said: \"Today I'm simplifying our tariffs on steel and aluminium. \"It's 25% without exceptions or exemptions.\" As he signed the order, Mr Trump said: \"It's a big deal. This is the beginning of making America rich again.\" He added: \"Our nation requires steel and aluminium to be made in America, not in foreign lands.” Ahead of the announcement, the beleaguered British steel industry body called for decisive action from ministers while unions warned further jobs could be put at risk in a sector which has already suffered badly in recent years. The UK exported 166,433 tonnes of steel to the US in 2023, the last full year for which figures are available. Figures from trade body UK Steel showed that in 2024 some 162,716 tonnes were sent to the US, but that does not yet include data from December. The US is the industry's second-largest export market after the EU, although the Government said it only accounted for 5% of UK steel exports in 2023.\n",

      "Kemi Badenoch has dismissed the idea the Conservative Party could merge with Reform UK ahead of the next election in her first major speech of 2025. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Tory leader used her first major speech of the year to hit out at the Government and rival party Reform UK as she promised the Conservatives would tell the British public “the truth.” It comes after former Conservative Home Secretary Suella Braverman told LBC she would be open to a coalition between the Conservatives and Reform UK in order to take down Labour at the next general election. Hitting out at this idea, Ms Badenoch said: \"Nigel Farage says he wants to destroy the Conservative Party. Why on earth would we merge with that?.” Kemi Badenoch joins Iain Dale on LBC from 7pm - Watch live on Global Player The Conservatives have seen Reform UK soar above them in the polls under Ms Badenoch’s leadership, but the Tory leader insisted she is doing a “serious job” in opposition. Ms Badenoch said her party would \"have to show how conservatism improves the lives of British people\" in order to regain the trust of voters. The Tory leader added: \"We will rediscover the idea that everyone contributes towards society, not just calculate what they can take out of it. We will again be the party of meritocracy. \"We believe that if you do right by your community, your family, your society, you will succeed, and if you don't, you likely won't.\" “From now on, we are going to tell the British people the truth, even when it is difficult to hear,” she said. \"The truth about the mistakes we made, the truth about the problems we face, and the truth about the actions we must take to get our country out of this mess.\" The Tory leader also placed Labour, and Prime Minister Keir Starmer in her sights, accusing the party of having a “woman problem” amid growing pressure on Chancellor Rachel Reeves. Asked what the relevance of Ms Reeves's gender was, she said: \"Well, when she stood up in her budget, she wanted everyone to know that she was the first female chancellor. \"I didn't stand up here congratulating myself for being a female leader, or being a black leader. \"And that's why when you open the door to those things, it means that people can comment on them.\" She accused Starmer of being “everything wrong with modern politics” and said the “country had lost its way” under Labour’s leadership. She said the Government is “strangling the spirit of enterprise” as she hit out Labour’s handling of the economy. She did admit, however, that previous Tory governments made mistakes on Brexit and immigration. The Conservative leader told the audience at the central London speech: \"I will acknowledge the Conservative Party made mistakes and I understand why the British people made it so clear in July that we needed to change. \"We were making announcements without proper plans. We announced that we would leave the European Union before we had a plan for growth outside the EU.\" She added: \"We announced year after year that we would lower immigration, but despite our efforts immigration kept going up. \"Those mistakes were made because we told people what they wanted to hear first and then tried to work it out later. That is going to stop under my leadership.\" The tone of Ms Badenoch’s speech was decidedly combative, something picked up on by journalists in attendance. Asked why her speech was depressing, she told journalists: \"I'm speaking based on where the Conservative Party is. We have just suffered our greatest ever defeat. \"I don't think the public will start trusting us if I turn up looking like I'm having a great time and everything's fantastic.\" Addressing Reform's lead over the Tories in the polls, she added: \"Nigel Farage has been knocking around for 20 plus years. He's been leading all sorts of different parties, so he has had a head start. \"I've been leading the Conservative Party for 10 weeks. Let's see where we are in a few months and years.\"\n",

      "Nigel Farage has told LBC he doesn't 'trust' the Tories after Suella Braverman admitted she would be open to a coalition. \n",
      "Nick Ferrari asked Mr Farage on LBC this morning: “How open would you be to some kind of deal in four years time?” Mr Farage said: “Would I trust them? The answer is no.” He said that he withdrew candidates to get Brexit over the line \"as an act of goodwill.\" \"What was I rewarded with?\" he asked Nick. He said he had been let down with promises on migration, and cutting EU red tape for businesses. “Really the question you are asking me is would I trust them? And the answer is no.” Mr Farage's comments come after Suella Braverman admitted she would be open to a coalition between the Conservatives and Reform UK in order to take down Labour at the next general election. The former home secretary said “there’s not enough room for two Conservative parties” based on recent polling and that the parties would need to come together to reach an overall majority. The Conservatives had their worst ever performance in last year's general election, winning just 121 seats, and much of this could be attributed to the rise of Reform, who won over 14% of the votes.

The data collected over the weekend puts Labour on 26%, Reform on 25% and the Conservatives on 22%. This is a major change from the general election, when Labour was on 35%, Conservatives on 24% and Reform on 15%. Ms Braverman admitted that it was the Tories' fault for allowing the rise of Reform given their stance on certain policies. She said: \"I've been warning for some time about the severe threat the Conservative party faces at the moment. \"We have been hurt by the Reform party because their success has been meteoric in a very short space of time and much of our defeat was because of Reform. \"This is our fault, the Conservatives failed to tackle immigration, we failed to cut taxes, we failed to stand up for common sense patriotic values and it's our fault that Reform has risen so exponentially.\" Aside from the motivation of defeating Labour at the next election, Ms Braverman advocated a coalition given the extent of overlap between the parties' policies and values. She said: “There's a lot of stuff that Reform talks about that I agree with. \"I’m a very strong advocate for leaving the European Convention on Human Rights, their policy approach on law and order, net migration. “I agree with that, many of my members agree. many members of the Conservative party agree with that so there is a lot of overlap.”  \n",

      "Taking calls from LBC listeners, the former Home Secretary called for the \"fast-tracking\" of criminal cases involving South Yorkshire grooming gang suspects. \"We could always have done more,\" she told Tom Swarbrick on Tuesday.  \"Could we have done more? Of course we could have done more,” she admitted of the Tory response into grooming gangs.  However, Braverman insisted the lack of national inquiry under the last Tory government was in response to the release of the Jay Report -  a report into sexual exploitation of children in Rotherham which saw the Conservatives implement 20 recommendations. Braverman added she was \"proud\" of measures implemented by herself and Rishi Sunak following its release.

Braverman's comments come just hours after Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch suggested grooming gangs were made up of \"peasants\" from \"sub-communities\". The Tory leader said on Tuesday that a new inquiry should look at background of perpetrators, as two more Labour MPs said they would back a national inquiry into grooming gangs. Sarah Champion, Labour MP for Rotherham, and Paul Waugh, the Labour MP for Rochdale - towns at the centre of the grooming gang scandal - backed calls for a national inquiry on Monday. \"I didn't have to do that,\" Braverman said of visiting victims in Rotherham while in power following the release of the Jay Report. Hitting back at Labour, she added: \"Why isn't the government taking action to galvanise the criminal justice system?\" \"Keir Starmer, for me, is choosing not to do that.\" she said, labelling it \"a failing\" on the part of the government. As for how the government should move forward in light of recent calls for a fresh national enquiry, Braverman said policing held the key. \"We need to be looking at what is happening on the frontline of operational policing.  \"How many dedicated and specialist police officers diverted to these cases? How many live investigations have they got on now?  \"Why isn't the government taking action to galvanise the criminal justice system - the judiciary, the prosecution, the police - to fast-track some of these cases?  \"That's something Keir Starmer could do tomorrow\".\n",

      "Speaking to Baltic news outlet Delphi, the former prime minister ​​attacked the Russian president for his Ukraine invasion and threats to other nations in the region.  \"What Putin is doing is archaic and barbaric, and he needs to understand that Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, none of these countries are part of the Russian imperium anymore, and nor is Ukraine,” he said.  Mr Johnson later added: \"It's over, over, over, over, no more empire Vladimir, you f***ing idiot, excuse my language.” The former Conservative PM likened Russia’s falling empire to Britain’s, arguing countries should accept when times have changed. H He also urged world leaders to renew efforts to help Ukraine join NATO to scupper Putin’s hopes of invading again.   Read more: British forces should help defend Ukrainian border against Russia in any ceasefire, Boris Johnson says Read more: Trump will 'certainly' do a UK trade deal, Boris Johnson claims - as Farage urges Starmer to 'roll out the red carpet'  “People have stopped talking about it.

He argued \"we have to be much more decisive\", adding that \"we will not solve the Ukraine problem without Article 5 guarantees or long-term Nato membership.” This is not the only global conflict the former prime minister has spoken about publicly since leaving Downing Street. He formerly stepped down as an MP in 2023.  Speaking to LBC in October, shared his thoughts on the ongoing Israel-Hamas war near the one-year anniversary of the conflict breaking out.  Mr Johnson told Nick Ferrari at Breakfast that \"too many people have forgotten the full horror\" of the October 7 attacks that left 1,200 people dead. Many of the hostages of the 250 taken by Hamas over a year ago remain unaccounted for.  Israel has vowed to eliminate Hamas and return the remaining hostages. The country's government has been heavily criticised for the tens of thousands of people killed in its retaliatory war in Gaza, according to Palestinian officials. Separately Israel has also launched a bombardment and ground incursion over its northern border into Lebanon, in a bid to suppress Hezbollah and stop the strikes on its own northern regions that have displaced tens of thousands. Mr Johnson said that his \"heart bleeds\" for the people of Gaza and Lebanon. But he insisted that \"you have got to face the reality that Israel is trying to deal with two sets of people who want to exterminate them and their country.\"  \n",

Number 10 questioned whether the former premier would also be writing to \"millions of people up and down\" the country who shared the Prime Minister's view. Ms Truss's legal team sent Sir Keir a cease and desist letter saying his claim that his predecessor-but-one \"crashed the economy\" or was \"crashing the economy\" was defamatory and \"false and misleading\". It also suggests that the assertion had been \"likely to materially impact public opinion\" at the last general election when she lost her Norfolk seat. Asked on Thursday whether the Prime Minister stands by his assertion, his official spokesman said: \"There's only so much I can talk about previous administrations, but you've got the Prime Minister's language which he absolutely stands by in relation to the previous government's record, and you don't have to take it from the Prime Minister. \"I think you can ask people up and down the country what the impact of previous economic management was on their mortgages, on inflation, and I think you'll get similar answers. \"But what we're focused on now is the decisions this Government needs to take to ensure that we tackle the long-standing underlying weaknesses in the UK economy that you know have obviously been around for many years - low productivity, low growth - because ultimately they are the fundamental reasons why wages have been low over recent years and ... the Government's number one mission (is) to deliver growth and deliver higher living standards for working people.\" Asked whether Sir Keir had plans to moderate his language, he said: \"No.\" While in Downing Street, Ms Truss unveiled a radical tax-cutting policy agenda that panicked the markets and saw the pound tank to a 37-year low against the dollar. Since being ejected from office after just 49 days, the former premier has admitted her plan to cut the 45p top rate of tax may have gone too far but insisted it was not fair to blame subsequent interest rate rises on her mini-budget. The new letter, sent by her lawyers and first reported by the Telegraph, argues that the market movement during her tenure in September and October 2022 should not be classified as a crash of the economy. The weeks following Ms Truss's mini-budget saw adverse market reaction and mortgage costs soar. Referring to the movements in gilts and exchange rates at that time, the letter says: \"Such rate movements cannot properly be described as a crash of the economy. \"To use such an expression is to display ignorance of basic economics and common usage of the term 'crash' when referred to an economy.\" During a question on public finances in the Commons on Thursday, Liberal Democrat MP Max Wilkinson referred to Ms Truss's cease and desist letter and asked Treasury minister Darren Jones if he \"might want to take advantage of parliamentary privilege\" to discuss the \"impact of her disastrous mini-budget\". Mr Jones replied: \"It was a direct connection between the hubris and the ego and the lack of focus on working people that Conservative ministers took when they were in government last time that ruined the lives of people across this country. \"I say that today, I'll say every single day because the British people must never forget the recklessness of the Conservative Party.\" At the Conservative Party conference in October, Ms Truss said it would be \"economic illiteracy\" to suggest that tax rises from Labour - at that point anticipated in Rachel Reeves' upcoming first Budget - were a result of her economic inheritance.\n",

      "\n",
      "Former Conservative Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has apologised to the families of Lucy Letby’s victims. He told the families he was sorry \"for anything that didn't happen that could potentially have prevented such an appalling crime\". Speaking at the Thirlwall Inquiry, which is examining how the former nurse was able to murder babies on a neonatal unit in Chester in 2015 and 2016, Mr Hunt admitted the killings happened on “his watch.” Lucy Letby, widely considered to be Britain’s most prolific killer of children, is currently serving 15 whole-life orders after she was convicted at Manchester Crown Court of murdering seven infants and attempting to murder seven others between June 2015 and June 2016. Read more: Liz Truss sends cease and desist letter to Keir Starmer over 'defamatory' claim she 'crashed the economy' Mr Hunt said while he wasn't responsible for everything “on every ward” in the NHS, he does take some responsibility for Letby’s crimes. Mr Hunt said: \"This terrible tragedy happened on my watch and although I don't bear direct personal responsibility for everything that happens in every ward in the NHS, you do have ultimate responsibility for the NHS. \"And insofar as lessons were not learned from previous inquiries that could have been, or the right systems were not in place that could have prevented this appalling tragedy, then I do bear ultimate responsibility and I want to put on the record my apologies to the families for anything that did not happen that potentially could have prevented such an appalling crime.  \"I think one of the things that could have potentially meant that what happened at the Countess of Chester was spotted earlier and the dots were joined up would have been having medical examiners.\"  He suggested medical examiners should be trained to see the signs or patterns of malicious harm in the work of a healthcare professional and that having \"malicious actors\" such as Shipman and Letby at the backs of their minds could make a \"big difference\".  The inquiry heard that a non-statutory rollout of medical examiners in England and Wales began in 2019.  Mr Hunt said: \"I think the medical examiner system when it works well is incredibly important to a healthcare system because I think it's not just important for learning from mistakes, it's also very important for families who have been bereaved to have someone independent that they can talk to and raise concerns.  \"Feedback from relatives was a very important clue for them as to where things might be going wrong.\" It comes as Conservative former minister Sir David Davis has called for Letby to be retried.  The senior Tory said there was no \"hard evidence\" implicating Letby and the case against her was \"built on a poor understanding of probabilities\".  He told MPs: \"If, as I believe it will, a retrial clears Lucy Letby she shall be released in her 30s, not in her 50s.\" Lawyers for Letby last month said they would make a fresh bid to challenge her convictions on the grounds that the lead prosecution medical expert at her trial was \"not reliable\". During an adjournment debate in the Commons, Sir David told MPs: \"There is case in justice, in my view, for a retrial. But there is a problem. One of the problems we face is that much of the evidence was available at the time.   \"What I have described is an expert analysis of the case notes, which were there at the time, but it was simply not presented to the jury. \"This means the Court of Appeal can dismiss it, basically saying the defence should have presented it at the initial trial. \"It is in essence saying, 'if your defence team weren't good enough to present this evidence, hard luck you stay banged up for life'. Now that may be judicially convenient, but it's not justice.\"\n",

      "Liz Truss has demanded that Keir Starmer stop claiming that she \"crashed the economy\" with her 2022 mini-budget.\n",
      "Lawyers for the Conservative former Prime Minister said the claim, often repeated by Labour ministers, is \"false and defamatory\" and was a factor in Ms Truss' failure to be re-elected as an MP last year. Ms Truss and then-Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng's autumn 2022 mini-budget, which combined tax cuts and plans to borrow more, caused turmoil in the financial markets.  The letter sent on behalf of Ms Truss claims that the mini-budget did not result in an economic crash because unemployment did not rise and economic output did not fall. The lawyers cite arguments from right-leaning economist Andrew Lillico, a fellow with the think tank the Institute of Economic Affairs. He said: \"There wasn’t any crash in the economy. The economy actually grew faster in the period immediately following the mini-Budget.\" In a video today, Liz Truss said she tried to fix the country’s economic problems back in 2022 but was “undermined by the economic establishment.”  She said Labour has borrowed ‘far more’ in her budget than the Tories did in 2022 but with ‘no plans’ for economic growth.  “I was smeared by the Labour Party and members of my own party for having crashed the economy.”  She said she faced an “onslaught” from the media and said her mini budget was “sabotaged.” It comes with British government borrowing costs soaring amid a sell-off in the bond markets this week, leading to fears that the Chancellor may have to raise taxes again or cut public spending. Several key figures have raised the alarm over the state of the British economy after Rachel Reeves' Budget in October.  The Bank of England warned that the Budget was hurting the economy, while a major survey by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) from December found companies expected to reduce both output and hiring. Labour have pointed towards the Tories' 14 years in government as they seek to deflect criticism for the state of the economy. During the election last year Starmer and other top Labour figures made frequent references to the mini-budget 'crashing the economy'. Ms Truss' letter, seen by the Telegraph, reads: \"We are writing in relation to statements you have made publicly in respect of our client which have caused and will likely continue to cause serious harm to her reputation. “Of particular concern are the false and defamatory public statements you made about our client in the lead-up to the UK general election from late May 2024. The lawyers said that Labour \"knew or ought to have known that those statements were false and the statements were likely to materially impact public opinion of our client whilst she was standing as the parliamentary candidate for the Conservative Party in South West Norfolk.\" They added that the statements are \"defamatory\" and causing continuing damage to our client’s reputation. “Accordingly, our client requests that you immediately cease and desist from repeating the defamatory statements at any point, from causing them to be repeated or from otherwise re-publishing the defamatory statements or any part of them. “We sincerely hope that this matter can now be resolved and that you will refrain from causing any further damage to our client.” Downing Street spokesperson said if Truss would be writing to \"millions of people up and down\" the country who shared Starmer's view. The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: \"I am not sure I have seen the detail of the letter, but from what I can my gather, I don't think the Prime Minister is the only person in the country who shares the view in relation to the previous government's handling of the economy. \"I guess the question is whether she will be writing to millions of people up and down the country as well, who felt her economic record which pushed their mortgage bills up.\"\n",

      "Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch clashed during a fiery Prime Minister's Questions as the PM urged the Conservative leader to drop her call for a national inquiry on grooming gangs.\n",
      "Sir Keir said a further inquiry could delay action on tackling child sexual abuse, pointing out that recommendations from a seven-year investigation which reported in 2022 had not yet been implemented. The Tories have tabled an amendment to the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill demanding a new national inquiry into gangs, but if MPs backed Ms Badenoch's call it would prevent the legislation making progress. Mrs Badenoch warned that failing to back an inquiry would fuel concerns about a \"cover-up\". But Sir Keir urged the Tory leader to \"withdraw her wrecking amendment\" to the Government's Bill. In heated Commons exchanges, Sir Keir said: \"This morning, I met some of the victims and survivors of this scandal, and they were clear with me that they want action now, not the delay of a further inquiry.\" He said \"there have been a number of inquiries, both national and local, including one covering Oldham, and reasonable people can agree or disagree on whether a further inquiry is necessary\". But calling for Mrs Badenoch to pull her \"wrecking amendment\", the Prime Minister said: \"What I find shocking is that anyone in this House would vote down the Children's Wellbeing Bill this afternoon, vital protections for the most vulnerable in our society.\" He said the Conservative leader had \"jumped on the bandwagon\" about grooming gangs but while in office as children's minister and equalities minister \"I can't recall her once raising this issue in the House, once calling for a national inquiry\". The Tory leader hit back: \"The Prime Minister called for nine inquiries in the last parliament. Does he not see that by resisting this one, people will start to worry about a cover-up?\" She urged the former director of public prosecutions to \"be a leader, not a lawyer\". The Prime Minister told the Tory leader that \"lies and misinformation and slinging of mud doesn't help one bit\".\n",

She accused the Reform leader of \"manipulating\" his own supporters after using a membership counter \"coded to tick up automatically\". It came as the party celebrated having more members than the Conservatives. \"It was a very odd, sort of whacky, conspiracy theory that she came up with at five o'clock on Boxing Day,\" Mr Farage told Nick. \"Whether she’d had a drink or not I have no idea, but somehow our membership ticker was pre-programmed.\" Read more: Nigel Farage defends Musk's 'rape genocide apologist' comments on Jess Phillips as 'not beyond the line' Read more: Nigel Farage says Reform will launch its own inquiry into grooming gangs scandal if Labour refuse to investigate He went on to say: \"She accused me of being a fraudster basically and I don’t like that.  \"You can call me what the hell you like, people do regularly, but I’ve always been straight and honest where money is concerned.\" Revealing how he planned to respond to the allegations, Mr Farage said: \"I'm not going to sue over it because I do believe in free speech, but I’m offended by it.  \"I asked for an apology, one wasn’t given, so I’m going to go to her constituency on the 31st of this month. \"I’m going to hold a big event for all Reform members living in her constituency – there are 417 of them from when I last checked – bet it’s more than she’s got.  \"There’s another 800 supporters living in the constituency and I'll do a big joint photo and say 'these are our fake members and we're coming for you at the next election'.\" At the time, Mr Farage accused Ms Badenoch of being \"bitter\". \"Kemi says I don’t understand the digital age,\" he posted on X. \"I have 5.4m followers and she has 320k.  \"We understand you are bitter, upset and angry that we are now the second biggest party in British politics, and that the Conservative brand is dying under your leadership.  \"However, this not an excuse to accuse us of committing fraud.  \"We will gladly invite one of the Big 4 firms in to audit our membership numbers as long as you do the same.\" Reform UK's deputy leader, Richard Tice, told LBC her reaction was \"hysterical\" and that she will need to eventually apologise. \"It's just deeply, deeply embarrassing for someone who repeatedly has claimed to be an engineer,\" he said. \"Of course we haven't fiddled the numbers, of course those numbers are bang-on accurate, she's effectively accused Nigel and us at Reform of fraud. \"I mean it's a pretty serious allegation and it shows her and her colleagues at the Conservative party don't understand technology, that number is pulled via a website, via our server directly from our nation builder database and is the accurate number.\"\n",

The Government has claimed \"thousands\" of state schools will receive an uplift in their funding next year, with an extra £2.3 billion for the core schools budget. Applying VAT at the standard rate of 20% on private school education and boarding fees will raise £1.5 billion in 2025, according to the Treasury, rising to £1.7 billion a year by 2029/30. Ms Reeves said: \"It's time things are done differently. \"Ending the VAT break for private schools means an additional £1.7 billion a year that can go towards our state schools where 94% of this country's children are educated. \"That means more teachers, higher standards, and the best chance in life for all our children as we deliver on our Plan for Change.\" Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said: \"High and rising standards cannot just be for families who can afford them, and we must build an education system where every child can achieve and thrive. \"Our ambitious Plan for Change sets out our clear mission to break the link between background and success and ending the VAT break enjoyed by private schools will provide much-needed investment in our state schools, to help recruit and retain expert teachers.\"\n",

A spokeswoman for Baroness May told Sky News: \"Baroness May and her husband, Sir Philip, are photographed at numerous events in any given year. \"As such, she doesn't remember when or where this particular photograph was taken or the man in question.\" A source close to Lord Cameron said: \"David Cameron was leader of the Conservative Party for over a decade and PM for six years. \"He met thousands of people in that time at hundreds of functions and events. We don't have any further information about this individual.\" Reform UK MPs say they are prepared to use Parliamentary privilege to name the suspected spy according to leader Nigel Farage. The rule gives MPs certain legal immunities over what they say in the Commons - and Mr Farage is threatening to use this power to reveal who the businessman is in the house. Speaking to the Mail on Sunday, Mr Farage said: \"The man should be named immediately - otherwise, the whole thing smacks of an establishment cover-up. \"If it's not resolved in the courts, he should be named in the Commons.

      "\n",
      "The thought has been echoed by other senior Tories such as Sir Iain Duncan Smith and Chris Philp, reports The Telegraph. Braverman, who was home secretary when the former civil servant from China was banned from entering the UK on national security grounds in July 2023, has expressed concern over the matter. MI5 had identified him as an agent involved in “covert and deceptive activity” on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party. Although his identity has been kept secret after he contested a decision by two judges that he should be named, the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC) judges ruled that the Home Office was justified in denying him entry to the UK to safeguard national security. Court documents revealed that H6 was so closely linked to Andrew that he was authorised to act on the Duke’s behalf when engaging with potential investors in China.  He was even invited to the Duke's birthday celebration in 2020. Braverman commented: “There is a strong public interest and indeed national security interest in disclosing the identity of this alleged Chinese spy. “We are under constant and almost incessant attack and threat from hostile states such as China. “We know that China is using all means necessary, particularly espionage and exploiting vulnerabilities in the UK, to gain access to state secrets and other sensitive information that could harm our national security. “So disclosing the identity of this person will have a deterrent effect on others involved in similar activities and will also ensure full transparency is provided on this issue of critical national security importance.” Sir Iain Duncan Smith, the former Tory leader and co-chairman of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, stated: “I call for anonymity to be lifted.  \"We really do need to publicly demonstrate how determined the Chinese authorities are to steal our secrets and undermine the UK Government. “This raises serious questions about the rush of Sir Keir Starmer and his government to engage in business with China, when at every turn they show they care nothing for what we want and are solely interested in what they can take from us.” Read more: 'Chinese spy' with close links to Prince Andrew banned from UK amid national security fears Read more: Prince Andrew under mounting pressure to reveal mystery financier who helped him dodge Royal Lodge eviction Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, argued: “There should not be anonymity.  \"It is important to expose who foreign spies are – as happened with Christine Lee [another alleged Chinese spy]. Other people may then come forward with relevant information. “Chinese infiltration is a serious threat to the Government and to businesses and academia, with state-orchestrated intellectual property theft rampant.” A letter referencing the birthday party from the adviser was discovered on H6's devices when he was stopped at a port in November 2021. The letter said: \"I also hope that it is clear to you where you sit with my principal and indeed his family. \"You should never underestimate the strength of that relationship... Outside of his closest internal confidants, you sit at the very top of a tree that many, many people would like to be on.\" Officials said that H6 had downplayed his relationship with the Chinese state, which combined with his relationship with Andrew, represented a threat to national security. Prince Andrew has revealed that he \"ceased all contact\" with the suspected spy after concerns were raised.\n",

      "The Liberal Democrats have suspended one of their candidates at the upcoming council elections in May, after he was spotted campaigning with George Galloway.\n",
      "Farooq Ahmed, who is standing as a Lib Dem candidate in Central Ward in Rochdale, has been spotted on numerous occasions campaigning against his own party at the upcoming Rochdale by-election. One Liberal Democrat councillor told LBC “it is inconceivable that we have a council candidate standing under a Lib Dem banner, who is campaigning - not just against our party - but for a man who is totally at odds with our values and principles in George Galloway”. They added “he needs to be suspended immediately”. Read more: Rochdale by-election | Full list of candidates Mr Ahmed has been delivering official Liberal Democrat leaflets - in which he is pictured alongside the party’s candidate Iain Donaldson - with the official website of the Rochdale Lib Dems as well as his ‘priorities for Central Ward’. George Galloway is one of eleven candidates standing in the Rochdale by-election on the 29th February after the death of veteran Labour MP Sir Tony Lloyd. LBC also recently revealed that Mr Galloway also had the support of Councillor Tiger Patel, a former Conservative. Both the Labour Party and the Green Party have withdrawn support for their respective candidates, Cllr Azhar Ali and Guy Otten. A Liberal Democrat spokesperson said: \"Under 3.8D of our Federal Constitution, you are not allowed to support another political party. Therefore Farooq Ahmed has clearly established he is no longer eligible to be a member.\"  A spokesperson for the Campaign Against Antisemitism told LBC\" \"George Galloway is an inflammatory firebrand with an atrocious record of baiting the Jewish community. He has previously and infamously declared Bradford an 'Israel-free zone', said of his previous election loss that 'the venal, the vile, the racists and the Zionists will all be celebrating', described David Baddiel, a Jewish comic who is well-known for not closely associating himself with Israel, as a 'vile Israel-fanatic ‘comedian’, described the Labour antisemitism allegations as 'a disgraceful campaign of Goebbelsian fiction' and was sacked by TalkRadio in connection with allegedly 'antisemitic views'. More recently, he has also espoused outrageous conspiracy theories since 7th October. His endurance in our public life serves to exploit extremist sentiment and divide communities. \"Clearly, this is someone the Lib Dems should wish to be distancing themselves from.\"\n",

      "“I’m not a politician, I’m just a grandmother who’s become really sad and angry at the way people are being treated,” Yvonne Tracey tells LBC.\n",
      "Like millions of Brits across the country, Ms Tracey, 68, was appalled to see the way hundreds of postmasters were treated during the Horizon IT scandal through the new ITV drama ‘Mr Bates vs the Post Office’. As a former deputy postmistress who worked in a branch in New Malden, south west London, for over 20 years, Ms Tracey had heard whispers of how postmasters were being affected by Fujitsu's Horizon programme, but never had any problems herself. Despite already having experience as an independent councillor in New Malden, Ms Tracey never saw herself going into politics full-time, let alone standing as an MP against the leader of the Liberal Democrats in Kingston and Surbiton. But with the “anger” that she was left with after watching ‘Mr Bates vs the Post Office’, which detailed how hundreds of postmasters were wrongfully accused of stealing money from the Post Office, she feels she has no choice. “Ed Davey is the MP in my constituency, I thought ‘I could stand against Ed, I would stand up for the postmasters’, because let’s face it, they still haven’t got justice, nobody has been brought to account, hardly anyone has been paid out, and they still don’t know what went on,\" Ms Tracey told LBC. “I had no ambitions in politics…but they need somebody who is going to speak for them.” Read More: Post Office owner jailed for life for murdering wife to launch appeal after faulty Horizon used in conviction Read More: Postmaster in Sir Ed Davey’s constituency left ‘suicidal’ after racist abuse ‘tried to contact MP three times’ Sir Ed has been under fire in recent weeks over his role in the Post Office scandal, which took place between 1999 and 2015, with a public inquiry still ongoing. During that time, Sir Ed served as post office minister during the Coalition government between 2010 and 2012, and was contacted by Alan Bates, a key campaigner who sought to hold the Post Office to account. Mr Bates asked Sir Ed for a meeting to discuss the issues hundreds of postmasters had been having, a meeting which Sir Ed said at the time “would serve little purpose”. For Ms Tracey, that is “unforgivable”, as is the fact that Sir Ed recently refused to apologise on 10 different occasions for his failure to hold the Post Office to account. “I’d like Mr Davey to come out and say what questions did he ask at the time, who did he ask them to, and what were the answers he was given,” she said. As an independent councillor, the scale of the challenge is not lost on Ms Tracey. She is more than aware that it will be an uphill battle to take on the Liberal Democrat party machine, who will be fighting to keep their leader in his seat. But along with her grandson, James Giles - another independent councillor and leader of the opposition in the Kingston council - Ms Tracey is up for the fight. “I know people are angry…they’re angry at the Post Office, Fujitsu, and they’re angry at Ed Davey.\"\n",

      "Sir Ed Davey has refused to hand back his knighthood despite his involvement in the Post Office Horizon scandal.\n",
      "The Liberal Democrat leader served as postal affairs minister under the coalition government from 2010-2012. Sir Ed has previously admitted he should have done more to prevent the Horizon scandal, which saw hundreds of sub-postmasters wrongly convicted. But he told LBC that ministers from all political parties had been misled by Post Office officials. Pressure has grown on Sir Ed after Paula Vennells, the former boss of the Post Office, handed back her CBE on Tuesday. The Prime Minister said she made the right decision.  Read more: Ex-Post Office boss Paula Vennells returning CBE \"obviously the right decision\", Downing Street says Read more: From the 'Prince of Darkness' to Sir Ed: The key figures who presided over the Post Office Horizon scandal But on Tuesday afternoon, Sir Ed's spokesman rejected calls for him to hand back his knighthood, which he was awarded in the 2016 New Year Honours list. \"As Ed has said many times, he wishes he’d known then what we all know now,\" the spokesman said. “It’s right that Vennells gave back her CBE, she was at the centre of a conspiracy of lies against the victims, the public and ministers of all parties. “As Alan Bates said yesterday, Ed was one of many ministers who was misled and lied to by the Post Office.\" Conservative Cabinet minister Mel Stride said that Sir Ed had \"questions to answer\" about how he handled the situation. It comes after Ms Vennells said she would give back her CBE with immediate effect on Tuesday afternoon. She said: \"I continue to support and focus on co-operating with the inquiry and expect to be giving evidence in the coming months. \"I have so far maintained my silence as I considered it inappropriate to comment publicly while the inquiry remains ongoing and before I have provided my oral evidence. \"I am, however, aware of the calls from sub-postmasters and others to return my CBE.\"I have listened and I confirm that I return my CBE with immediate effect. \"I am truly sorry for the devastation caused to the sub-postmasters and their families, whose lives were torn apart by being wrongly accused and wrongly prosecuted as a result of the Horizon system. \"I now intend to continue to focus on assisting the inquiry and will not make any further public comment until it has concluded.\" Ms Vennells was awarded the CBE in the 2019 New Year Honours List for services to the \"Post Office and to charity”. The Post Office scandal has been brought back into the public eye by a TV show called Mr Bates vs The Post Office, which recounts the story, which has been called the most widespread miscarriage of justice in British history. Over 700 Post Office branch managers were given criminal convictions after faulty Fujitsu accounting software, Horizon, made it look as if money was missing. Sub-postmasters quickly realised unexplainable discrepancies in their records but the Post Office dismissed concerns as no one else was experiencing such issues. Soon, the Post Office accused the sub-postmasters of taking the missing finances for themselves and started criminal proceedings. One sub-postmaster from Wales, Alan Bates, and five others from JFSA (Justice For Subpostmasters Alliance) took the post office to court on behalf of 555 claimants. In 2019, the High Court ruled that the software contained \"bugs, eros and defects\" with \"material risk\" which caused shortfalls in the Post Office branch accounts. Mr Davey said: \"I want to congratulate Alan Bates for his campaign. I really hope the government listens and the inquiry delivers for the postmasters.\" The government is considering ways to overturn the convictions, including possible legislation. But some of the wronged sub-postmasters want to have their names cleared in the courts and the Post Office held to account, rather than through legislation. Ministers are now drawing up plans to fast-track appeals for postmasters that were wrongly convicted. Kevin Hollinrake, the postal affairs minister, told the Commons that “options” had been devised to resolve outstanding criminal convictions “much more quickly”. “We believe we have a solution,” he told MPs, with a further update expected later in the week. Mr Hollinrake vowed to \"leave no stone unturned\" amid the growing pressure to quash the convictions and speed up the awarding of compensation to those affected by the IT system error. \"We have devised some options for resolving the outstanding criminal convictions with much more pace,\" the minister said. \"While the scale of the problem is immense, the Government is unwavering in its resolve to tackle it, to compensate those affected and to leave no stone unturned in the pursuit of justice.\"\n",

      "The Liberal Democrats are under increasing pressure to suspend one of their prominent members of the House of Lords. \n",
      "Baroness Hussein-Ece has represented the party in Parliament since 2010, and was previously on the frontbench as the Lib Dem spokesperson for Women and Equalities.  However, comments unearthed by LBC show that the peer has repeatedly described Israel’s actions as “genocide”, has “incessantly faulted Israel” for the bombing of the Al-Ahli Arab Hospital and has shared posts claiming no one in Gaza has committed a “single act of violence”.  In response a spokesperson for the Campaign Against Antisemitism (CAA) told LBC: \"Some of Baroness Hussein-Ece's comments on social media are over the line.  \"This is tantamount to the sort of propaganda that fuels antisemitism in the UK. A peer of the realm should know better.\" Since the attacks by Hamas in Israel on October 7, Baroness Hussein-Ece, who has also previously been both a Labour and Lib Dem councillor, has repeatedly described the Israeli government’s subsequent actions as a “genocide”.  On Facebook she recently posted pictures of a pro-Palestinian march in London and described the actions as a “massacre of Palestinian people”.   Meanwhile, on the 27th October the peer tweeted: \"Western leaders are complicit in this genocide”.  Speaking to LBC News, Lib Dem Chief Whip Wendy Chamberlain said it was right Baroness Hussein-Ece apologised but would not be drawn on if the peer should be thrown out of the party. “Those posts were offensive, and I think it’s right that Baroness Hussein-Ece has apologised, and has agreed to undertake training.” When Simon Conway pointed out she was still sitting on the Lib Dem benches Ms Chamerlain said: “I think it is right that she’s agreed to undertake training, and hopefully we can learn the lessons and move forward from this.” Read More: Gaza becoming a 'graveyard for children', UN chief warns, after Hamas claims death toll 'passes 10,000' Read More: More than 10,000 killed in Gaza since the start of the war, Hamas claims, after Israel carries out strikes overnight One post particular which has prompted anger from the CAA was just last week, when Baroness Hussein-Ece tweeted: “I thought Remembrance Day was to proclaim ‘Never Again?’ Calling for peace & a ceasefire, an end to the killings is exactly appropriate”.  The CAA spokesperson added to LBC: \"Describing Israel's self-defence in Gaza as a betrayal of the principle of 'Never Again' is dangerously close to a comparison of Israel to the Nazis, which is a breach of the International Definition of Antisemitism”.  The UK’s Special Envoy for Post-Holocaust issues Lord Pickles told LBC: \"This is in clear breach of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s definition of Antisemitism.  \"It’s one of the examples given to compare Israel to the Nazi’s. It wasn’t the Israeli’s who came out in the early light of the 7th October like a ‘nazi death squad’ to murder people on the basis of their race, it was Hamas.\" Other comments by Baroness Hussein-Ece, who was also a commissioner on the Equality and Human Rights Commission, include sharing a post from Instagram in which it questions “have you seen a single person in Gaza with a gun or weapon of ANY kind?... Have you seen any [Palestinian Flag] commit a single act of violence. It is not a war when one side has guns, bombs, soldiers, and billions of dollars in US aid; and the other has nothing. It is a GENOCIDE.\" The peer has also come under criticism for claiming it was Israel who bombed Gaza’s Al-Ahli Arab Hospital. In tweets, which are still on her ‘X’ feed, she says in two separate posts: “Bombing a hospital is a war crime. No excuses #GazaUnderAttack”, and “Now let’s fear whether bombing a hospital is ok”.  These claims are despite the intelligence services in the US, Canada, France and Britain indicating that the origins of the explosion were likely from within Gaza. Similarly, on November 1st the peer shared a quote saying “Israel’s settler-colonial goal is liberally to ERASE Palestine and millions of Palestinians”. In response the Campaign Against Antisemitism labelled her comments as the “incessant faulting of Israel for the bombing of a hospital that quickly emerged to have been the fault not of Israel at all but of a terrorist group's errant rocket, is disgraceful”.  The Campaign Against Antisemitism have confirmed they will be officially writing to the Liberal Democrats after the revelations by LBC. Lord Pickles, who was a formerly a Cabinet Minister and Chairman of the Conservative Party said if the peer was a Conservative “she would be immediately suspended for these allegations to be investigated.  And if she is guilty, she would be expelled”.  The Chair of Liberal Democrat Friends of Israel, Gavin Stollar told LBC: \"Using the phrase 'never again' in the context of the current conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza is as ill-considered and inappropriate as it is offensive. This is not a phrase to be bandied about in this way\".   He added: \"Baroness Hussein-Ece should reflect on her language. I'm pleased that she has tweeted that her comments were offensive, unequivocally, and that she has apologised for that. And I'm pleased she has opted to engage in antisemitism educational training.\"  Baroness Hussein-Ece has since said in an online statement: \"A few of my tweets about Israel / Gaza were offensive and have upset people and I'm sorry. I am deeply worried about the humanitarian situation in Palestine and Israel and those who have lost loved ones.   \"This is not about me. I have undertaken to take part in the holocaust awareness training along with other Lib Dems Peers to ensure continuing advocacy for peace in the Middle East in a way that is sensitive and effective for all our communities.\" In response, the Liberal Democrats have confirmed they are looking into the comments.\n",

      "Several prominent Conservatives have urged Rishi Sunak to scrap the ban on new petrol and diesel car sales planned for 2030, after Labour's by-election loss in Boris Johnson's former constituency was blamed on the ultra-low emission zone (Ulez) expansion.\n",
      "The Conservatives lost two of the three by-elections on Thursday night, but unexpectedly held onto Uxbridge and South Ruislip in west London - an area set to be hit by the Ulez expansion at the end of next month. Labour linked the loss to Ulez on Thursday, with leader Sir Keir Starmer calling on London mayor Sadiq Khan to \"reflect\" on the expansion of the scheme in light of the setback. And some Conservatives have used the victory as a warning, telling Rishi Sunak that Labour's loss may be a harbinger of their own electoral defeat in 2030 if the ban on new petrol and diesel car sales remains in place. Lord David Frost, Boris Johnson’s Brexit negotiator, said: \"The lesson is surely that green policies are very unpopular when there’s a direct cost to people - as indeed all the polling says. \"This time that hit Labour. But soon it could be us unless we rethink heat pumps and the 2030 electric car deadline.\" Read more: Former Conservative minister David Gauke unsure if he will vote for Tories in next election Read more: Keir Starmer brands Conservative minister Johnny Mercer a 'silly sod' for comparing new Labour MP to the Inbetweeners Meanwhile Sir John Redwood, a former head of the No 10 policy unit under Margaret Thatcher, asked: \"Will Mayor Khan cancel Ulez now voters have told him how unpopular it is?  After winning Uxbridge by speaking out against Ulez, will the Government now act to stop so many attacks on motorists?\" Craig Mackinlay, the Conservative chairman of the net zero scrutiny group, told The Telegraph: \"We need to get the 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel cars overturned at least until 2035, which is where most of the developed world is going. It is pre madness to saddle ourselves with this deadline.\" It comes after the Tories lost two out of the three by-elections held on Thursday night. Mr Sunak avoided a by-election wipeout after Labour secured a record win in Selby and the Liberal Democrats took Somerton and Frome. The Conservative Party held on to Boris Johnson's former Uxbridge seat on Friday, despite early suggestions that Labour could take the win. Steve Tuckwell managed to retain it for Rishi Sunak's party, sparing him from being the first prime minister since 1968 to lose three by-elections on the same day. Labour has blamed London mayor Sadiq Khan's policy of expanding the Ulez low emission zone to outer boroughs - including Uxbridge and South Ruislip - for its failure to take the seat. Speaking to LBC following the by-election victory, Mr Sunak said the Ulez expansion is the \"perfect demonstration of everything that is wrong with the Labour party\".  \"They just don’t understand the values and concerns of hard working people,\" he said.  \"Everyone knows that everyone is struggling with the cost of living at the moment. My plan is to halve inflation and bring it down.  \"That’s what I’m focused on doing and the numbers this week show that that plan is working. What are the Labour party doing?  \"Putting £12.50 every time you want to take your kid to football practice, every time you want to visit your GP, every time you want to go to the supermarket.\" Read more: Tories maintain hold on Boris Johnson's former Uxbridge seat in by-election blow to Labour's Keir Starmer Read more: Lib Dems celebrate 'stunning victory' as they win Somerton and Frome by-election Mr Tuckwell, meanwhile, also said Ulez was the reason behind his win. \"That determination to push Ulez on Uxbridge and South Ruislip has cost Labour the election this evening,\" he said. But the Tories went on to face a scathing blow in both Selby and Somerton and Frome after Labour and the Lib Dems both had respective wins. Tory party chairman Greg Hands told LBC's Tom Swarbrick that losses in Selby and Somerton and Frome can be explained by Conservative voters \"staying at home\".  As for the Tory party holding onto Mr Johnson's Uxbridge seat, Mr Hands told Tom that the victory showed a \"clear rejection\" of Labour policy in the Greater London Ulez expansion, set to be brought in by Labour mayor Sadiq Khan.   Read More: The Conservative win in Uxbridge is an undeniable warning shot to Sadiq Khan over Ulez, writes Henry Riley Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said the \"stunning victory\" for his party showed that it was \"firmly back\" in its former West Country stronghold.  \t \"Wow, I'm really starting to like by-elections!\" he said.  \"What we achieved here [Somerton and Frome] is nothing short of spectacular and what's particularly exciting for me is seeing the Liberal Democrats winning again in our old Liberal heartlands in the southwest.\" He continued: \"The trend is clear...the Liberal Democrats are BACK in the west country.\" Newly elected MP Sarah Dyke said she was \"excited, exhilarated and most of all humbled\" at the result. \"It's unbelievable and most of all I am delighted that finally Somerton and Frome have finally got a voice in the constituency but also in Parliament and I can't wait to get started,\" she said.  \"I think the result here shows a very clear message now that the Liberal Democrats are back in the West Country.  \"Not only do we have the largest group of Liberal Democrat councillors on Somerset Council we now have an MP in Somerset.\" Following Labour's Selby and Ainsty win, Keir Mather, aged just 25, said the Conservative government have \"failed us\" - and \"now it's time for a fresh start\". \"In a year's time I believe we will be on the precipice of a Labour government,\" he said. \"Today we have made history.\" Mr Mather's win marks the first time since 2010 that the constituency will not be represented by the Tories. He secured a 4,161 majority in the North Yorkshire seat and Labour said it was the highest majority the party had ever overturned in a by-election.  \t A similar swing across the country would result in it winning more seats than in Tony Blair's 1997 landslide.  \t Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: \"This is a historic result that shows that people are looking at Labour and seeing a changed party that is focused entirely on the priorities of working people with an ambitious, practical plan to deliver.  \t \"Keir Mather will be a fantastic MP who will deliver the fresh start Selby and Ainsty deserves.  \t \"It is clear just how powerful the demand for change is. Voters put their trust in us - many for the first time. After 13 years of Tory chaos, only Labour can give the country its hope, its optimism and its future back.\"\n",

      "A former Conservative Cabinet minister has said he is not sure if he will vote for his former party in the next general election.\n",
      "David Gauke served in several ministerial roles including Justice Secretary before standing down under Boris Johnson and eventually losing the Conservative whip after voting against the government. Mr Gauke, who ran as an independent and lost his seat in 2019, told LBC's Ben Kentish on Friday that he was a \"floating voter\". He said: \"I'm one of those that sort of was made somewhat politically homeless, and I'm going to give some thought as to which way I vote at the next general election. Mr Gauke added that he had \"a fair amount of time for Rishi Sunak\" whom he described as a \"decent man\". But he addded that \"there are elements of the Conservative party that worry me\". It's unclear if he would go as far as voting Labour. Asked by Ben if he could see himself backing Sir Keir Starmer's party, Mr Gauke said: \"I think that's, that's probably unlikely, particularly in the constituency in which I live.  \"So I'm a floating voter and I will follow the events of the next you know, few months with close interest.\" It comes after the Tories lost two out of the three by-elections held on Thursday night. Mr Sunak said the Tories' one victory in Uxbridge and South Ruislip showed the next general election is not \"a done deal\" and vowed to \"double down\" on his five priorities.

Speaking to LBC following the by-election victory, Mr Sunak said the Ulez expansion is the \"perfect demonstration of everything that is wrong with the Labour party\".  \"They just don’t understand the values and concerns of hard working people,\" he said.  \"Everyone knows that everyone is struggling with the cost of living at the moment. My plan is to halve inflation and bring it down.  \"That’s what I’m focused on doing and the numbers this week show that that plan is working. What are the Labour party doing?  \"Putting £12.50 every time you want to take your kid to football practice, every time you want to visit your GP, every time you want to go to the supermarket.\" Read more: Tories maintain hold on Boris Johnson's former Uxbridge seat in by-election blow to Labour's Keir Starmer Read more: Lib Dems celebrate 'stunning victory' as they win Somerton and Frome by-election Mr Tuckwell, meanwhile, also said Ulez was the reason behind his win. \"That determination to push Ulez on Uxbridge and South Ruislip has cost Labour the election this evening,\" he said.

Meanwhile, the Labour Party gained 500 seats and the Lib Dems gained 405 councillors and control of 12 more councils.   Based off the local election results, some general election projections have suggested Labour would not gain a big enough share of the vote to win an outright majority, raising the prospect of a hung Parliament.  This also raises the prospect of the biggest party entering into a coalition government with another party, as happened between the Tories and Lib Dems following the 2010 general election. Read more: Lib Dems hint at coalition with Labour - and may demand Brexit rerun as the price It is important to note that voter turnout in local elections is often lower, skewing the possibility of results being reflected in a national election. Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and London were also not included in the recent local elections.  But the prospect of a Labour-Lib Dem coalition remains on the cards, particularly as Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer refused to say seven times whether he would seek a coalition deal with Sir Ed's party.  Asked whether he would rule out a coalition with Ed Davey's party, Sir Keir dodged the question, and pushed back on comparisons with Tony Blair's first victory.  Watch Call Keir again in full on Global Player Instead, Sir Keir noted how the party had been dragged up from its disastrous performance in the 2019 general election has seen him having to do Kinnock, Smith, and Blair \"in one run\". He was then asked a further six times whether he would do a deal, but wouldn't address the question. But the Labour leader did rule out a deal with the SNP, as he fundamentally opposes breaking up the union, and stressed there could be \"no basis\" for an agreement. Sir Keir was then asked by a caller what assurances he could give that Labour wouldn't turn hard-left once they won power. Sir Keir said the party has made huge changes to the Labour party in the past three years, and it is now \"unrecognisable\" from what it was in 2019. He continued: \"We've now changed our rules on, for example, standing for the leadership of the Labour party, so that you have to have much more support of the parliamentary Labour party, so that acts as a filter in relation to whenever the next leadership race is.\" Read More: 'We've sunk into a pit of dysfunctional politics': Andy Burnham urges Labour to consider PR voting amid coalition talk The prospect of a Labour-Lib Dem raises questions about potential policy that each party would potentially have to concede ground on in order to form a government.  One issue likely to factor high in discussions with the Lib Dems is proportional representation. Under this voting system, parties, groups and independent candidates are elected to Parliament in proportion to the number of votes they receive, rather than based on how many constituencies are won as is the cast with first-past-the-post. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has previously rejected calls for PR reform, saying: \"No, it’s not a priority for me\" - reiterating his stance on the issue with LBC on Monday's Call Keir. It comes after Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham called for Labour to consider proportional representation amid talk of a coalition with the Lib Dems.  Speaking on LBC's Tonight with Andrew Marr, Andy Burnham said: \"I think proportional representation would have the effect of empowering places over the civil service and the machine because I think the way parliament currently works is that it doesn't fully empower all parts of the country.\" He continued: \"I certainly think it should not be taken off the table and think it should considered as part of radical package to rewire the country and make the country work better for all people and all places.\"\n",

But polling experts have predicted that if the nation voted the same way it had in the locals, Labour would fall short, with Sir John Curtis putting Labour on 312 - 14 seats shy of an overall majority.

      "Water regulator Ofwat has launched an investigation into Thames Water over concerns it will not complete more than 100 environmental schemes funded by customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The regulator said it would probe whether delays to the plans mean England's largest water firm has breached its licence. The schemes were aimed at making improvements to water companies' environmental impact, such as through upgrades to sewage treatment works and reducing wastewater spillages. Thames Water pledged to carry out 812 schemes as part of a wider national programme between 2020 and 2025, to meet national regulations. But Ofwat said it was told by the utilities giant that it would be unlikely to complete more than 100 of these schemes by the end of March deadline. Read more: Heathrow to expand two terminals in multibillion-pound investment ahead of controversial third runway Lynn Parker, senior director for enforcement at Ofwat, said: \"Customers have paid for Thames Water to carry out these essential environmental schemes. \"We take any indication that water companies are not meeting their legal obligations very seriously. \"Therefore, we have launched an investigation to understand whether the delayed delivery of environmental schemes means that Thames Water has breached its obligations. \"If we find reason to act, we will use our full range of powers to hold Thames to account for any failures and will require them to put things right.\" Thames is currently the only firm regulated by Ofwat to be facing a probe into its environmental protection programmes. Meanwhile, the parent company of the embattled utilities firm is set to run out of money by late March and risks entering special administration if it does not get court approval for a restructuring plan. It is in about £16 billion of debt and needs £3.3 billion over the next five years to keep running. Thames Water has been contacted for comment.\n",

      "Bringing growth to the British economy is a higher priority than Labour’s net zero goals, Rachel Reeves has said. \n",
      "\n",
      "Launching a fresh push for growth, the Chancellor said boosting the economy is the most important goal of Keir Starmer’s government. Ms Reeves said growth projects should not be held back “because they ‘might add something to carbon emissions in 20 years’ time.” When asked if she would prioritise economic growth over preventing climate change, she said  “It’s obviously the most important thing.” It comes as Sir Keir Starmer is set to promise he will end the \"challenge culture\" that saw major projects such as nuclear power plants, wind farms and roads delayed by unarguable bids for judicial review. Read more: Starmer takes on the NIMBYs: PM to tackle infrastructure 'blockers' by cutting legal challenge options Opponents currently have three opportunities to secure permission for a judicial review against a major infrastructure project - firstly by writing to the High Court, then in an oral hearing and finally by asking the Court of Appeal. But under plans set to be announced by the Prime Minister on Thursday, the written stage will be scrapped and any cases deemed \"totally without merit\" will be unable to ask the Court of Appeal to reconsider. The Prime Minister will say: \"For too long, blockers have had the upper hand in legal challenges - using our court processes to frustrate growth. \"We're putting an end to this challenge culture by taking on the Nimbys and a broken system that has slowed down our progress as a nation. \"This is the Government's Plan for Change in action - taking the brakes off Britain by reforming the planning system so it is pro-growth and pro-infrastructure.\" Thursday's announcement follows Sir Keir's pledge before the election to put the Government on the side of \"builders, not blockers\", as Labour sees improving Britain's infrastructure as key to its mission of securing economic growth. Writing in the Daily Mail, Sir Keir said: \"Cases that are unarguable and unwinnable can be brought back to the courts three times. That causes years of delay. It costs hundreds of millions of pounds. It clogs up the courts. And strangles growth. \"The entire country pays the price. \"Bringing back common sense to building is the least this country deserves. Because if we want growth, we need the infrastructure to support it.\" The Government has already committed to making 150 major infrastructure project decisions by the next election, and on Wednesday announced changes to environmental protection rules to speed up building work.\n",

      "Hollywood Boulevard has been evacuated as the \"apocalyptic\" wildfires ravaging LA continue to spread. \n",
      "Two new fires have started as six wildfires now rage in the Los Angeles area, with one spreading rapidly through the iconic Hollywood Hills neighbourhood, home to many film studios and the Hollywood sign. The Hollywood Walk of Fame, the TLC Chinese Theatre and the Hollywood Bowl have all been cleared as the blaze - dubbed the Sunset Fire - continues to wreak havoc. An alert read: \"A Mandatory Evacuation Order is now in place for Laurel Canyon Blvd (on the west) to Mulholland Dr (on the north) to 101 Freeway (on the east) down to Hollywood Blvd (on the south).\" Fire chiefs in California say there is no chance of containing the extensive wildfires, as high winds fuel the blaze across the Pacific Palisades. Recent hours have seen President Biden officially categorise the wildfires a \"national disaster\", meaning the state now has access to emergency funds. Chiefs warned late on Wednesday that the wildfires could potentially become the most destructive in the history of the state of California. Officials say that at least 1,000 buildings have been destroyed so far, with upwards of 130,000 people evacuated - including celebrities Mark Hamill, Tom Hanks, Ben Affleck, and Miles Teller. A host of Hollywood A-listers have also seen their luxury mansions turned to ash in recent hours, including Nobody Wants this actor Adam Brody and wife Leighton Meester, Diane Warren and Anna Faris. Locals have now been asked to conserve water, as firefighters turn to the domestic water system to fight the flames. It comes despite authorities saying there was a 0% chance of controlling the flames. Read more: WATCH: Influencer battles to save luxury $5m LA home before it succumbs to wildfire Janisse Quiñones, chief engineer and CEO of the Los Angeles department of water and power, told reporters on Wednesday that by 3am on Wednesday morning, the three 1m-gallon tanks serving the Palisades had all run dry. “We had a tremendous demand on our system in the Palisades. We pushed the system to the extreme,” Quiñones said during an early Wednesday morning press conference.  “Four times the normal demand was seen for 15 hours straight, which lowered our water pressure.” It comes as President Biden landed briefly in California en-route to Washington, meeting with fire chiefs on Wednesday. He says the government will do \"anything and everything\" it can to help officials contain the four ongoing wildfires in Los Angeles. The declaration of a \"national emergency\" will assist with resources and the subsequent rebuilding effort. Meanwhile, president-elect Donald Trump has hit out at Mr Biden and California Governor Gavin Newsom, holding them responsible for the \"apocalyptic\" fires. \"Governor Gavin Newscum refused to sign the water restoration declaration put before him that would have allowed millions of gallons of water, from excess rain and snow melt from the North, to flow daily into many parts of California, including areas that are currently burning in a virtually apocalyptic way,\" Mr Trump wrote on Truth Social. Firefighters have warned that the California wildfires cannot be contained, with Malibu feared to be the next location in the fire's path. The high winds and low humidity have coincided, resulting in a 'once-in-a-decade' fire. Speaking in a press conference at 4:30pm PST on Tuesday (00:30 GMT), the Los Angeles county fire chief confirmed the official death toll had risen to five. Read more: Thousands forced to evacuate California wildfires as officials forecast 'worst to come' - follow live According to the Los Angeles Regional Fire Safe Council, the most destructive fire on record was previously the Woolsey fire of 2018, which burned 1,121 structures. Other fires in California have caused more deaths, and have burned greater areas, however, the level of destruction seen to buildings and homes has resulted in the fire being categorised as record-breaking. Speaking in a press conference, Pasadena Mayor Victor Gordo said his thoughts and prayers are with all caught up in the Eaton fire. More than 100,000 people are under mandatory evacuation orders he confirmed, with another 100,000 warned that they could soon be evacuated. LA County Supervisor Kathryn Barger says the damage in the Pasadena area \"is surreal\". \"These are fires that are actively taking place as we speak,\" she said. Hitting out at looters, she added: \"The full weight of the county will come down on you.\" Kristin Crowley, fire chief of the Los Angeles Fire Department, added: \"We want to make sure that everybody understands we are absolutely not out of danger. \"Our firefighters will remain focused on protecting lives and property.\" Up to 99mph winds have been recorded, causing the rapid and uncontainable spread of the flames. In response, California Governor Gavin Newsom has declared a state of emergency, while all LA firefighters have been called to duty. It's believed that the worst is yet to come as wind conditions will get worse. LA's police chief described the last 48 hours as a \"tragic time\" in the city's history.  James McDonnell said: \"This is a tragic time in our history here in Los Angeles. \"It's critical that at these times we be patient, that we come together, that we focus on saving lives and to be able to the very best job we can.\" At least 30,000 people are under evacuation orders from the Eaton alone, with 70,000 across the city.  Pacific Palisades is an exclusive neighbourhood in western Los Angeles and home to many celebrities. The area is popular among celebrities due to its privacy, with Matt Damon, J-Lo, Chris Pratt, and Adam Levine among those who live there. Chris Pratt took to social media to thank firefighters and first responders for working \"tirelessly\" to protect \"lives, homes, and wildlife.\"  He said those battling the blaze are the \"true heroes\" and encouraged his followers to support one another through the emergency.\n",

Firefighters continue to battle the “unprecedented” fires, but authorities have warned “the worst is yet to come.” Hollywood A-listers have seen their luxury mansions turned to rubble and ash as the fire causes indiscriminate chaos across the California city’s suburbs.

Two people have been confirmed dead as fires continue to rip through the Californian city. Firefighters have warned that the California wildfires cannot be contained, as 30,000 people have been forced to flee their homes across the Pacific Palisade area - with Malibu feared next.

He warned another massive fire is growing in Pacific Palisades. \"We have over 500 personnel assigned, and unfortunately, we have two reported fatalities, two civilians,\" he said of the Eaton fire, which has burned around 2,000 acres of land. \"We have well over 5,000 acres that have burned, and the fire is growing,\" Mr Marrone added of the fire in Pacific Palisades.

      "The Government and regulators broke the law by allowing water firms to discharge sewage outside of \"exceptional circumstances\", the green watchdog has ruled.\n",
      "\n",
      "Combined sewer overflows (CSO) are only supposed to be opened in rare circumstances such as flooding or heavy rain. However, according to the Office for Environmental Protection, the Environment Department (Defra), the Environment Agency (EA) and Ofwat failed to comply with these laws, dumping sewage into England and Wales’ water. The bodies have two months to respond or risk being taken to court. Conservation charity WildFish said the public bodies had allowed water companies to pollute English rivers unlawfully for years, and called for storm sewage pollution to be brought to an end. Helen Venn, the OEP's chief regulatory officer, said: \"The core issue identified in our investigation is the circumstances in which the regulatory system allows untreated sewage discharges to take place. Read more: 'Spy' was a 'founding member' Prince Andrew's Chinese money-making venture \"We interpret the law to mean that they should generally be permitted only in exceptional circumstances, such as during unusually heavy rainfall. \"This is unless an assessment of the CSO concludes that the costs to address the issue would be disproportionate to the benefits gained. \"While the public authorities are now taking steps to ensure their approaches are aligned and reflective of the law, we have found that this has not always been the case.\" Dumping sewage into waterways can harm wildlife, destroy ecosystems and be the course of E.Coli when ingested by swimmers. Ms Venn added there had been positive steps to address the issue, including Defra's consultation on updated guidance, the EA's consultation on storm overflows including permit conditions for spills from CSOs and draft orders and investigations into water companies by Ofwat. Ms Venn said: \"We will decide next steps when we have considered the responses to these decision notices. That could include court action.\" Guy Linley-Adams, in-house solicitor for WildFish, said: \"What the OEPs' announcement has clarified is that much of the storm sewage pollution that is plaguing English rivers would not be occurring had Government and regulators done their jobs properly. \"Storm sewage pollution should have been - and must now be - brought to an end under 30-year-old statutory and regulatory obligations.\" WildFish chief executive Nick Measham added that the organisation would be watching the Government and regulators extremely closely to see how they brought the \"current illegality to a rapid end\". \"This widespread law-breaking by water companies must be dealt with,\" he said. Responding to the investigation findings, an Environment Agency spokesperson said: \"We recognise regulation of the water industry needs to improve, which is why we are transforming our approach with more people, powers and data alongside better training for our staff. \"We've also made significant progress in addressing the issues identified by the OEP and are consulting on updates to our permitting approach and regulatory framework for storm overflows.\" A spokesperson for Ofwat said: \"We are actively taking steps to remedy the issues the OEP has identified. \"We will continue to prioritise our enforcement investigation into all wastewater companies which started in 2021 to ensure that companies are meeting their environmental obligations.\" It comes as Ofwat looks likely to announce a massive increase to water bills on Thursday.  A Labour spokesperson said the findings laid bare the \"Conservative's utter failure to regulate the water industry\" and \"the result of their catastrophic policies has left record levels of sewage pollution in Britain's rivers, lakes and seas\". The spokesperson said the Labour Government had acted \"decisively\" to place water companies under special measures, with new powers to ban bonuses and bring criminal charges against polluting water bosses.\n",

      "A UN climate summit is \"no longer fit for purpose\" an activists' group has said after Cop29 in Azerbaijan.\n",
      "Top scientists and climate policy experts said that countries that do not back getting rid of fossil fuels shouldn't host future summits. Ilham Aliyev, president of Azerbaijan, told Cop29 earlier this week that oil and gas is a \"gift\" from God. Among those who signed the open letter on the fifth day of Cop29 in Azerbaijan were former UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon, former executive secretary of UN Climate (UNFCCC) Christiana Figueres and former Irish president Mary Robinson. They warned UNFCCC head Simon Stiell of limitations to the the existing Cop process, which aims to drive the rapid, large-scale changes urgently required to limit warming to the 2015 Paris Agreement goals to limit dangerous global warming.

But the signatories said: \"It is now clear that the Cop is no longer fit for purpose. We need a shift from negotiation to implementation.\" Sandrine Dixson-Decleve, executive chair of Earth4All who signed the letter, said: \"We need a Cop process that offers delivery, not delay.  \t \"We demand Cops that are platforms for government and stakeholder ambition, not enablers of fossil energy contracts and growing greenhouse gas emissions.  \t \"After 28 Cops, time is up on negotiations that don't foster action and implementation. Planetary stability is dependent on equality, justice and poverty alleviation to address the greatest existential challenge of our time.\"  \t The call for reform also comes on the heels of reports warning of increasing global carbon emissions, the degradation of carbon sinks, and unprecedented climate-related human and economic losses.  \t The letter signatories warned that the world can no longer exclude the possibility of surpassing 2.9C of warming by 2100.  \t Ms Figueres said: \"At the last Cop, fossil fuel lobbyists outnumbered representatives of scientific institutions, Indigenous communities and vulnerable nations.  \t \"We cannot hope to achieve a just transition without significant reforms to the COP process that ensure fair representation of those most affected.\"\n",

      "The UK’s biggest water company has failed three key environmental tests carried out by LBC in the latest edition of Feargal on Friday. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Feargal Sharkey, the legendary lyricist and former lead singer of The Undertones, headed to Witney in Oxfordshire, an area once represented by former prime minister Lord Cameron, where he waded into the Colwell Brook, a small stream which ultimately feeds into the River Thames. For years, local campaign groups, such as Windrush Against Sewage Pollution, have highlighted the brook’s deteriorating condition to Thames Water, which oversees the treatment of sewage in the region. In particular, they have noted the abundance of sewage fungus in the brook, a stringy and slimy collection of bacteria which is often a byproduct of effluent from sewage works. Read more: LBC and Feargal Sharkey uncover pollution three times above 'excessive' levels in Britain's rivers Read more: 'It's filthy': Feargal Sharkey and LBC find South Yorkshire's iconic River Don fails series of environmental tests LBC’s testing has now provided further evidence to substantiate these concerns. The brook failed for the deadly bacteria E-Coli, phosphate and nitrates, whilst also registering borderline results for ammonia. Testing carried out by Simplex Health on behalf of LBC showed the presence of E Coli exceeded the level at which the Environment Agency (EA) considers a river to be “poor quality bathing water”. It is the second river which has failed Feargal’s E Coli audit, after the River Severn displayed levels fifty-times over the EA’s limit.  Meanwhile, the brook’s phosphate levels were twice the upper limit defined by the internationally-respected Water Framework Directive, and over three times above the point at which the concentration of nitrates in a river is deemed “excessive”. Both nitrates and phosphates are indicators of the presence of sewage in a river. The latter can culminate in the spawning of algal blooms, which can prevent sunlight reaching water bodies, potentially resulting in the death of the wildlife inhabiting them. Reflecting on these results, Feargal noted the discrepancy in the regulation faced by farmers and the water industry as a key reason for the problems facing the brook. “There are predominantly two sources of nitrogen that we would be concerned with - human sewage and farming. Farmers have got very strict regulations on where and when they dump slurry… it is effectively illegal. “Water companies do not have to comply with the same legislation. They create it as a byproduct of treating human sewage and dump it straight into our rivers. “All of that toxicity, all of that poison, flows down Colwell Brook into the River Windrush, onto the River Thames, and throughout the Thames Valley there are over 200 sewage works… adding yet more death, destruction and ecological damage to a river system that’s already stressed. And we call that progress in the 21st century?” As well as facing criticism for their environmental record, Thames Water is on the brink of financial collapse. The company has accumulated over £15bn of debt and has argued that, in order to service these debts, it will be necessary to up bills by 59% over a five-year period. In response to LBC’s investigation, a Thames Water spokesperson said: “We know how much people enjoy and appreciate rivers, and we are committed to seeing waterways thrive, but we can’t do it alone. Farming, industry, road runoff, wildlife and increasingly extreme weather also play a role in river health. \"We have clear and deliverable plans to upgrade 250 of our sites across the region, to increase treatment capacity and reduce the number of storm discharges, including at our Witney sewage treatment works. “As infrastructure ages and demand on it increases, more investment is needed across the entire sector. That’s why we’ve asked for increased investment in the next regulatory cycle between 2025-2030.”\n",

      "Keir Starmer has revealed Britain's new target to slash emissions, but insisted that he won't ask British people to change their lifestyles to achieve it.\n",
      "The Prime Minister promised to reduce Britain's emissions by 81% compared with 1990 levels by 2035 and urged other countries to put similar national targets in place. Speaking from Cop29 in Baku, Starmer said that this change would be driven by a promise to move away from fossil fuels for electricity generation by 2030. Some experts have argued that Brits will have to change their lifestyle in order for the country to meet this target. The Climate Change Committee said around 10% of the change would come from \"an accelerated shift in diets away from meat and dairy products, reductions in waste, slower growth in flights and reductions in travel demand\".

I don't think that as we tackle this really important issue the way to do it is to tell people how to run their lives and instruct them how to behave.\" He added: \"\"We set out the target, which is an important, ambitious target, what we are not going to do is start telling people how to live their lives.  \t \"We are not going to start dictating to people what they do.\" Sir Keir also said he would not be banning people from using private jets when asked if this could be a measure to reduce the UK's carbon emissions.  The leaders of China, France and the US are among those not attending Cop29. The Taliban, the Islamist political group that has ruled Afghanistan since the departure of the US-led coalition in 2021, is among the attendees. Starmer will not be speaking with the Taliban, the government has confirmed. The Prime Minister also plans to push the private sector to \"start paying their fair share\" when it comes to climate commitments. Starmer met president of the World Bank Ajay Banga on the fringes of the summit and thanked him for his support as he launches the CIF Capital Market Mechanism. It will list on the London Stock Exchange and is part of the UK's efforts to raise climate finance at scale. A Downing Street spokesman said after the meeting: \"The Prime Minister said that this demonstrated London as a green finance capital, and bolstered Britain as an attractive place to invest in the future.\" The climate conference in Azerbaijan comes days after the re-election in the US of Donald Trump, who is expected to boost fossil fuels, roll back green incentives domestically and pull his country out of the Paris climate agreement again. Starmer said he would not comment on Mr Trump when asked if he was prepared to call out the president-elect about his claims that climate change is a hoax, saying: \"I'm not going to comment on his views. I am very clear in mine.\" The Prime Minister has said he sees action on climate change as not just an obligation, but an opportunity. \"The UK has a huge opportunity to get ahead here when it comes to renewables,\" he said. \"That's why I'm encouraging as much investment as I can when it comes to carbon capture, when it comes to hydrogen, when it comes to offshore wind. \"There's a global race on now to be the global leader on this. I want us to be in the race and I want us to win the race.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "The tourist hotspot, which is currently facing a slew of weather warnings, spent Friday preparing for potential flooding, with the city expected to be hit head-on by the storm. It comes as more than 200 people are now known to have died in Spain following flash floods on Tuesday - with slews more still missing. Rescuers are searching for survivors after a year's worth of rain arrived in one day - with the Valencia region most affected. Read more: Tributes pour in for former Valencia footballer, 28, killed in Spanish flash floods - as up to 400 feared dead According to Spanish weather agency Aemet, the Island of Majorca will be hit with heavy rain and potential flooding over the weekend. The agency warned: \"One-hour accumulated precipitation: 50 mm. In some areas, more than 120 mm can accumulate in a few hours.\" The warming continued: \"Precipitation is expected in the south-eastern peninsular, south-east of Castilla and Leon, Aragon, Cataluna, Levante and Baleares, without falling into large areas of the Alps. \"May be dangerous Chubascos and torments locally fierce and/or persistent in the far west from Andalucia and in the lower Ebro and Baleares without discarding areas of the southern part of the system Central Western.\" \"On Saturday the instability will continue in the Eastern Mediterranean area and in the southern part of Andalucia, with chubascos and torments that could still be locally fierce y/o persistent in Tarragona, Castellon, Valencia and Baleares, without discarding them in Cadiz and the West from Malaga.\" Public areas throughout Palma have been placed on lockdown, with red tape blocking off parks and homeless people evacuated from flood zones. Locals have been warned to only go outside if “absolutely necessary.” Palma's first deputy mayor, Javier Bonet, said: “We are not on red alert, but it is essential to warn the population to avoid greater risks.” On mainland Spain, the army has been deployed in a bid to find survivors. So far 205 deaths have been confirmed. The security forces and soldiers are searching for an unknown number of missing people, many feared to still be trapped in wrecked vehicles or flooded garages. Authorities are repeating over and over, more storms are expected. The Spanish weather agency issued alerts for strong rains in Tarragona, Catalonia, and part of the Balearic Islands. Many streets are still blocked by piled-up vehicles and debris, in some cases trapping residents in their homes. Some places still do not have electricity, running water or stable telephone connections. Residents turned to the media to appeal for help. \"This is a disaster. There are a lot of elderly people who don't have medicine. \"There are children who don't have food. We don't have milk, we don't have water. We have no access to anything,\" a resident of Alfafar, one of the most affected towns in south Valencia, told state television station TVE. \"No-one even came to warn us on the first day.\" A former Valencia footballer is among the victims of the flooding. Tributes have poured in for 28-year-old midfielder Jose Castillejo. Before retiring in 2020, he left Valencia for Paterna in 2015 before spending stints at Eldense, Bunol, Recambios Colon, Roda, Torre Levante and Villamarxant. La Liga champions Real Madrid's match against Valencia, which was scheduled for Saturday, has been postponed. The Spanish Football Federation has postponed all matches in the Valencia region. In a tweet, the club said: \"Valencia mourn the passing of José Castillejo, casualty of the flash floodings \"José Castillejo came up through the @Academia_VCF youth system up to U18 level and played for others teams in the region. \"R.I.P.\"\n",

      "Climate plans are \"falling miles short\" of what is needed to stop global warming from “wrecking billions of lives”, the United Nations has warned.\n",
      "The current national plans submitted to the UN could cut global greenhouse gas emissions by 2.6% from 2019 to 2030, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) said. The body said this figure is only \"only a fraction\" of what is \"urgently needed\" given emissions should decrease by 43% by 2030 in order to prevent the worst impacts of climate change, according to UN climate scientists. The UNFCCC also said the current plans represent only “marginal progress” from the same annual report last year when 2030 emissions were forecast to be 2.0% lower than in 2019. This comes after the UN Environment Programme found the chances of limiting global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels were \"virtually zero\". UNFCCC chief Simon Stiell said: \"Current national climate plans fall miles short of what's needed to stop global heating from crippling every economy, and wrecking billions of lives and livelihoods across every country. \"Much bolder new national climate plans cannot only avert climate chaos,\" he said, but can also generate \"stronger investment, economic growth and opportunity, more jobs, less pollution, better health and lower costs, more secure and affordable clean energy\".

The UK government has pledged to submit its updated NDC in November, at the UN climate summit COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan but today's warning puts more pressure on countries to come up with an ambitious agreement for the conference. The key issue on the table is finance for developing nations to help them ditch fossil fuels and cope with climate impacts. Greenpeace UK's policy director Dr Doug Parr said floods and hurricanes are \"devastating lives and livelihoods around the world in real time\". These impacts, along with today's news, paint a \"terrifying picture for the fate of humanity\" and should give a \"slap in the face\" to governments, he said. \"Now is the moment for real leadership from the heads of the global community.” On Saturday, the Climate Change Committee - the UK's climate advisers - warned the new plan should commit to slashing greenhouse gases by 81% in 2035, compared with 1990 levels. Professor Piers Forster, interim chair of the CCC, said this was feasible with today's technology. The UK’s emissions have peaked and are now falling while global emissions are expected to peak before 2030. Last year their levels in the atmosphere hit a new record high, the UN's weather body said today in a separate report.\n",

These warnings come after a decade of climate talks, as well as a boom in the use of solar and wind power.

Responding to the report, UN secretary general Antonio Guterres said the world was \"teetering on a planetary tightrope\". \"Either leaders bridge the emissions gap, or we plunge headlong into climate disaster - with the poorest and most vulnerable suffering the most,\" he said. Nations committed to limiting temperature rises to \"well below\" 2C and pursue efforts to curb them to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels at the Paris climate talks in 2015. As things stand, world leaders have \"virtually zero\" chance of meeting these goals.  Scientists have warned that there is no safe amount of climate change, but 1.5C has come to be seen as a threshold beyond which the worst impacts of climate change-driven heatwaves, droughts, floods, collapse of natural systems and rising sea levels will be felt. Inger Andersen, executive director of UNEP, said: \"Climate crunch time is here. We need global mobilisation on a scale and pace never seen before - starting right now, before the next round of climate pledges - or the 1.5C goal will soon be dead and well below 2C will take its place in the intensive care unit.\" She urged nations meeting for Cop29 to increase action now, set the stage for stronger national plans and then \"go all-out to get on a 1.5C pathway\". She added: \"Even if the world overshoots 1.5C - and the chances of this happening are increasing every day - we must keep striving for a net-zero, sustainable and prosperous world. \"Every fraction of a degree avoided counts in terms of lives saved, economies protected, damages avoided, biodiversity conserved and the ability to rapidly bring down any temperature overshoot.\" At current rates, the world must cut its emissions by a further 7.5% every year until 2035 if countries wish to meet their climate commitments.  Last year was the hottest on record, with warnings 2024 could be even warmer, according to EU scientists. The average global temperature was 14.98C, which is 0.17C hotter than the previous record set in 2016, the EU's climate change service Copernicus said. According to Met Office scientists, the record might not last long, with 2024 set to be hotter than ever. Samantha Burgess, deputy director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service, said: \"2023 was an exceptional year with climate records tumbling like dominoes. \"Not only is 2023 the warmest year on record, it is also the first year with all days over 1C warmer than the pre-industrial period. \"Temperatures during 2023 likely exceed those of any period in at least the last 100,000 years.\"\n",

      "Action on the climate crisis will be \"central to all the Foreign Office does\", David Lammy said, as he argued that net zero became a \"battleground\" under the Tories.\n",
      "\n",
      "He has called for a \"hard-headed\" approach to the tackling the climate crisis in his first major speech in the role, adding that nothing could be \"more central to the UK's national interests\" than slowing climate change worldwide. In the speech - held at London's Kew Gardens - he said action on the climate and nature is the defining geopolitical challenge of the era. He confirmed he will be reinstating the UK Special Representative for Climate Change role and will create a new UK Special Representative for Nature. He also announced his department's commitment to the \"global clean energy transition\", which he says will help countries \"leapfrog\" fossil fuels. He wants to create an alliance of countries that share knowledge and tech to become greener. He added: \"So our goal is progressive, a liveable planet for all now and in the future, but we need a hardheaded, realist approach towards using all levers at our disposal, from the diplomatic to the financial.  \t \"And I say to you now, these are not contradictions, because nothing could be more central for the UK's national interests than delivering global progress on arresting rising temperatures.\"  \t Mr Lammy went on to say: \"The threat may not feel as urgent as a terrorist or an imperialist autocrat, but it is more fundamental, it is systemic, it's pervasive and accelerating towards us at pace.\" In the role, Lammy said he has witnessed events such as the devastation caused by Hurricane Beryl. In places such as the Sahel, South Sudan and Syria where temperatures are rising and making water and productive land even scarcer. \"These are not random events, delivered from the heavens.

Badly wrong, in our national debate on climate change and net zero.\"  \t He added: \"Net zero became, under the Tories, a battleground. A battleground of the worst type of narrow-minded Westminster tactical warfare.\" He listed the Conservative failures on the issue such as crashing off-shore wind, blocmking on-shore wind, moving the goalpost of electric vehicles, doubling down on oil and gas, leaving national parks in decline, and lakes, rivers and seas polluted with toxic sewage.\n",

      "Flooding forced the fish out of their normal freshwater habitat into the sea last year, which experts say killed them. This week the fish’s bodies flooded into a tourist port in the central city of Volos, creating a silvery blanket along the river.

It's not just along the coast, but also in the centre of the Pagasetic Gulf,\" city council member Stelios Limnios said, explaining the body of water impacted by the fish. Local mayor Achilleas Beos described the smell as “unbearable” as he hit out at the national government for failing to prevent the swarm of fish from arriving in their town. \"They didn't do the obvious, to put a protective net,\" he said. He warned the mountain of dead fish could lead to an environmental disaster if they are not removed in time. \"Closing the barrier now doesn't help. Now it's too late, the tourist season is over,” local restaurant owner Dimosthenis Bakoyiannis said. Earlier this month, shocking images showed groups of fish dead in a West Midlands after a sodium cyanide chemical spill. Exposure to the chemical can cause headaches, nausea, dizziness, confusion, changes in heart rate and loss of consciousness, according to the agency. Ingesting cyanide salts, which can dissolve in water, releases cyanide into the body, the agency's website states.\n",

In the 90-minute sessions allegedly costing £222, women were told to visualise themselves with bigger breasts. On Wednesday, Mr Polanski apologised for his past actions and said he never believed them. \"It does not represent my work, it does not represent me.\" Mr Polanski added he never charged for the service. \"This was 11 years ago. I wasn't involved in politics at all,\" he added. The deputy leader said he'd had a \"varied life experience\" before becoming a politician, adding he'd also been a barman, waiter, nightclub doorman and actor. He also said he apologised the day after the article came out. \"I apologised because I recognise that can be offensive to people\", he said.

The Green Party want big pots of money from the wealthiest in society- that's why we're proposing the wealth tax.\" He also spoke of the importance of Net Zero. \"Net Zero will take up every single area of our economy.

      "The Green Party is investigating a councillor who shouted 'Allahu Akbar' after his election and said Palestinians had the right to 'fight back' after the October 7 attacks.\n",
      "Mothin Ali was elected as a councillor for the Gipton and Harehills ward in Leeds after winning more than 3,000 votes. He declared his election victory as a \"win for the people of Gaza\". Mr Ali, 42, said in a victory speech on Friday: “We will not be silenced. We will raise the voice of Gaza. We will raise the voice of Palestine.\" He then shouted \"Allahu Akbar!” - which translates to 'God is the greatest' in Arabic. The phrase is an Islamic declaration of faith and is used frequently within prayers. It has been used as a battle cry by a very small minority. Mr Ali is a father-of-three, works as an accountant and runs a gardening blog in his spare time. It comes after videos were uploaded to Mr Ali's social media following the October 7 attacks where he said Israel would “use the pretext of the fightback by Hamas fighters or supposedly Hamas fighters this morning” to launch attacks on Palestinian civilians. He also said Gaza is the “biggest concentration camp the world has ever seen” and that he supported \"the right of indigenous people to fight back”. Mr Ali, prior to his election as a councillor, said in the video that Israel is a “settler, colonial, occupier” that has tried to “erase the legitimacy of a native population”.

Rabbi Zecharia Deutsch received threats from pro-Palestinian activists due to his previous service in the Israel Defence Force (IDF).  A Green Party spokesperson told the Telegraph in a statement: “The Green Party is investigating issues drawn to our attention in relation to Councillor Mothin Ali, so cannot comment further. \"However, we are clear that we never support anything that extols violence.” LBC approached Mr Ali for comment but he did not immediately respond.\n",

      "Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has called the Budget \"a cruel joke\" and \"an admission of failure\" following the chancellor's speech in the Commons.\n",
      "The leader of the opposition \"welcomed\" the government's decision to take steps to reduce the impact of the coronavirus outbreak but said the rest of the Budget \"doesn't come close\" to fixing the country's problems. Mr Corbyn accused the chancellor of using \"sleight of hand\" to try and deceive the public into thinking today's announcements were a \"turning point for the country.\" Read more: 'Coronavirus Budget' - the chancellor's speech as it happened Read more: How will Rishi Sunak's spending spree affect you? He added that the changes being made \"go nowhere near reversing the damage\" caused by a decade of austerity. \"Today's Budget was billed as a turning point, a chance to deliver, in particular on the promises made to working-class communities during the general election,\" he said. \"But it doesn't come close.\" He continued: \"The government's boast of the biggest investment since the 1950s is frankly a sleight of hand. It's in fact only the biggest since they began their slash and burn assault on our services, economic infrastructure and living standards in 2010. \"Having ruthlessly forced down the living standards and life chances of millions of our people for a decade, the talk of levelling up is a cruel joke. Mr Corbyn went on to say that this Budget was an admission that austerity had been a \"failed experiment\" which did not solve the country's economic problems and, in fact, \"made them worse.\" He slammed the Tories for holding back the country's recovery and for failing even while they held the reins of power. The leader of the opposition referenced the 100,000 staff vacancies in the NHS and said the service had been devastated by a £1 billion \"slashing\" in recent years. He said: \"Public health is based on the principle that prevention is better than cure, but this government is providing money only after a serious outbreak is under way.\" In addition, he claimed that social care \"is in crisis\" as there was an £8 billion funding gap since the Tories came to power in 2010. On the economy, the Labour chief said the UK's position is \"fundamentally weak\" and that the government's claim of the largest increase in public spending was \"smoke and mirrors.\" Mr Corbyn concluded by ironically thanking Dominic Cummings for \"writing a Budget so quickly,\" but said that it had been \"a let down.\" He finished by saying: \"The reality of today's announcements will become clear and the hard sell and the spin will fade away and this Budget will then be seen to be a lost opportunity, a failure of ambition and a bitter disappointment to all those people who had been promised so much, but from what we've heard today, they're actually going to see very, very little.\" Former Green Party leader Caroline Lucas said there had been \"plenty of green rhetoric\" in the Budget but that the actions of the Treasury \"continue to drive the climate emergency.\" \"We've got a freeze on the fossil fuel duty, the freeze in the fuel duty, we've got over £20 billion in new roads compared to just £1 billion on green transport, and no commitment to removing the climate-destroying duty to maximise the economic recovery of fossil fuels,\" she said. The SNP's spokesman in the Commons Ian Blackford called for greater measures to boost the tourism and hospitality sectors during the Covid-19 outbreak. He told MPs: \"Urgent measures are needed to help the tourism and the hospitality industry above and beyond what has been offered today. \"Industry leaders are already warning of the consequences of the coronavirus with a raft of booking cancellations and a significant drop in numbers. \"The SNP has advocated a package of measures including a temporary drop in the VAT rate to 5% to help businesses reduce their costs.\" Conservative former prime minister Theresa May commended Chancellor Rishi Sunak for the \"difficult\" Budget he had to deliver. She said: \"I trust in the discussions that were held prior to the delivery of the Budget that there was the necessary tension between No 10 and the Treasury in developing this Budget. \"Generally speaking, prime ministers want to spend money and chancellors want to manage the public finances prudently.\" Tory former chancellor Sajid Javid, who was sat behind Mrs May and stepped down from the role mid-February, could be heard joking: \"So true.\" However, Mrs May also criticised the chancellor for \"not mentioning\" the industrial strategy in his Budget speech. Mr Javid then congratulated his successor, saying that although he \"recognised much\" of the Budget, Mr Sunak was \"absolutely right to focus\" on the threat posed by the coronavirus.\n",

      "More than 80 people were evacuated last Monday and two residents were taken to hospital after the blaze engulfed the whole building, including scaffolding surrounding the property and the roof. The property was undergoing \"remedial\" work to remove and replace \"non-compliant cladding\" on the fifth and sixth floors containing flats, according to a planning application document. The building had \"known\" safety issues, the London Fire Brigade (LFB) has said. The residents have now spoken out collectively over the \"tragedy\" that \"destroyed our homes\" and was \"entirely preventable\". Some also suggested they would be out on the streets by Monday because council hasn’t secured emergency accommodation for more than a few days.

Others speaking out expressed their fury after being \"left in limbo\" after \"hoping for some help from the council\" but finding \"nothing adequate enough to support us\". One woman spoke through tears as she told LBC said she was struggling to cope and explain to her children why they could not go home. \"I haven't had a proper two nights sleep since this happened,\" she said, adding, \"I'm tired, I've been panicking and just trying to pull myself together for my children, but it's breaking me.\" Deputy Prime Minister and hosing secretary Angela Rayner visited the destroyed apartment block earlier this week where she told LBC progress on making buildings safe has been too slow. She said residents and firefighters had faced a “fireball” in Dagenham, which came more than seven years on from the Grenfell Tower fire and just a week before that inquiry’s final report is published. Ms Rayner spoke of how “horrifying” it must have been for them to wake up to smoke and flames in the early hours, and said it had been “incredible” that no-one had been killed. Grenfell United, which represents many of the bereaved and survivors of that 2017 fire, said the incident in Dagenham “highlights the painfully slow progress of remediation across the country, and a lack of urgency for building safety as a whole”. The group added that, seven years on, “the fact that when a fire happens the best we can hope for at the moment is ‘a near miss’ speaks volumes of the progress made since”. Cladding on the seven-storey Dagenham building had been in the process of being removed, with scaffolding visible at the site and London Fire Brigade confirming there were “known fire safety issues”. Barking and Dagenham Council said: \"The building is privately owned, and no council tenants were living there. Block Management UK Ltd manage the building and we are calling on them to comply with their obligations to affected residents. \"Together with the Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government, we will also look to recover costs from responsible parties.\" Block Management UK has been contacted for comment.\n",

      "The Deputy Prime Minister has admitted that progress to remove unsafe cladding after the 2017 Grenfell Tower Fire has been “going far too slowly”.\n",
      "Speaking to LBC at the scene of Monday’s devastating tower block fire in Dagenham, East London, Angela Rayner pledged to get to work in holding building owners to account and making houses safe. She said: “It’s horrendous to see the scale of the damage that’s happened here. I don’t want to speculate on the investigation but this is a building that was known to have cladding on it that was in the process of being removed.  “There’s still a lot of work to do on remediation and since taking on this role I think that’s been going far too slowly and I will be meeting with the health and safety executive and the building safety regulator to speed up that process. “Far too many people are living in fear and we’ve got to make sure the work is carried out as quickly as possible and people feel safe in their homes.”  The Deputy PM said around half of remediation work hasn’t yet started on buildings with below-standard cladding since 2017 and told LBC that isn’t good enough. “These are not blocks of assets, these are people’s homes and I will be pushing those regulators to make sure that the work is carried out. “People will be really concerned that there are still buildings that have flammable cladding on them but we are identifying those buildings and enforcing the law and making sure that people are held to account.” Residents of the Spectrum building in Dagenham have been sharing their accounts of escaping the flames that engulfed their homes just before 3am on Monday.  Some have said there were no fire alarms, or sprinklers and one person claimed a fire escape gate was padlocked shut. Mohammad, who lives on the sixth floor, told LBC: “\"If it wasn't for my wife's nose because she's six months pregnant, her heightened sense, I could say it saved our lives. Imagine coming down in that state with her, what our minds were going through, our first child on the way. Just imagine how that was, no fire alarms, no warnings.  “A woman's intuition of what's going on saved three of our lives potentially\". The commissioner of London Fire Brigade told reporters inside the cordon of the scene that the block of flats was one of more than 1,100 in the capital city that he has raised concerns about.  Andy Roe said: “I have 1,300 buildings in London that are in my opinion un-remidated and must be as a priority. This is one of very many of them. “It is the responsibility of building owners and managers to make sure the systems inside their buildings function properly and in that number, it gives you an idea of the challenge we face as a service to hold them to account.” It’s understood the cladding on the upper two floors of the block was unsafe, after extra flats were built onto the top of the existing building. It was in the process of being removed, with scaffolding still surrounding it. Angela Rayner spoke to LBC in front of the damaged facade, where windows have been blown out to leave a black shell, balcony railings have been left rusted and the top two floors completely gone. Part of the building has now been deemed unsafe for fire investigators to access, meaning the process of working out how the fire began and spread will take longer to do.  Matt Wrack, the general secretary of the Fire Brigades’ Union, told LBC the lack of action around building safety has been “absolutely staggering” ahead of the publication of the final report into the Grenfell Tower fire next week. “We’re very pleased that the deputy prime minister has attended today and spoken to us and listened to the concerns that the firefighters had. “We’re saying this crisis has not gone away and is putting firefighters every day in an impossible position because firefighting techniques are designed around buildings that work as they’re expected to work - not ones that completely fail like this one. “There needs to be a serious discussion about building safety and how quickly we can right the faults in those existing buildings where it’s been identified and how firefighters tackle fires in residential blocks of flats.”\n",

      "Michael Gove has admitted the Government must shoulder responsibility for the \"faulty and ambiguous\" guidance he says was exploited and led to the Grenfell tower fire.\n",
      "The blaze killed 72 people and led to a review of cladding on buildings and concern about whether regulations were tight enough to avoid a similar disaster from happening. An inquiry into the disaster is yet to report back. But levelling up secretary Michael Gove said: \"There was a system of regulation that was faulty. The government did not think hard enough, or police effectively enough, the whole system of building safety. Undoubtedly.\" He told The Sunday Times: \"I believe that [the guidance] was so faulty and ambiguous that it allowed unscrupulous people to exploit a broken system in a way that led to tragedy.\" Developers are going to be given a deadline of six weeks to sign a Government contract to fix any towers that are still deemed unsafe or face being banned from building new homes.

Businesses involved in Grenfell were accused of not taking enough responsibility and instead focusing on preparing themselves for future legal battles during the inquiry. Mr Gove later told Sky News he \"absolutely would\" apologise to families of the Grenfell victims.

There were people in that building who had warned beforehand that they were in potential danger. The warnings were not heeded. \"I'm the first, I hope, to acknowledge that we haven't done right by the bereaved and the residents and survivors from Grenfell and that is one very, very important mission. \"But it's also the case that there been people who have been effectively imprisoned in their own flats for too long.\"\n",

      "Up to 12 have been diagnosed with the disease – understood to mostly be digestive cancers and leukaemia – but more than 20 may be affected. Firefighters and survivors from the disaster have called for medical screenings as a list of rescuers who went to the scene in 2017 and have cancer is being drawn up. Strokes, heart disease and kidney failure are also understood to have been recorded among the heroes – possibly due to the physical toll on their bodies during the tragedy. \"We are expecting some really depressing data to be revealed soon. It's shocking,\" a fire service source told the Mirror. Read more: Woman in her 20s dies 'after dog attack' as armed officers detain seven animals Some of the 1,300 firefighters thought to have attended the scene were left in their contaminated suits for more than 10 hours while others were in a smoke-filled basement for up to six hours. Firefighters ran out of air and could have breathed in smoke. Analysis carried out on the debris found there were heightened concentrations of chemicals that cause cancer and proven carcinogens with 200 metres of the tower, the paper said. Responders were also seen outside the tower in the days after the blaze without wearing protective kit, with some experts fearing toxins could have been even worse for people in the wake of the blaze. Meanwhile, research this week found firefighters are twice as likely to end up being diagnosed with cancer if they find soot in their nose or throat, and the same rate applies to those who stay in their often contaminated kit for more than four hours after a fire. Read more: Ex-Premier League star jailed for £15m fraud of friends and family to fund luxury footballer lifestyle Riccardo la Torre, Fire Brigades Union national official, said: \"This vital research proves that firefighters are suffering and dying from cancer, strokes, heart disease, and mental ill health as a result of going to work and protecting the public. \"We now know that firefighters are exposed to health and life-threatening contaminants as a result of their occupation, and certainly would have been at an incident the size and scale of the Grenfell Tower Fire. \"However, firefighters are left in the dark due to the lack of regular health surveillance and proper monitoring of exposures in the UK. \"Due to this inaction by the government and fire bosses, the Fire Brigades Union is commissioning further research to help us demand proper protection and support for our members who attended Grenfell, and for firefighters all over the UK.\" David Badillo, the first firefighter who went in, said: \"On a personal level it’s very worrying. I've got two young kids and I want to see them grow up. \"I've been scanned and nothing’s come up, thankfully, so far, but you don't know what could happen in the future.\" Another firefighter said he felt suicidal and had been left with scarred lungs. \"I've heard loads of guys and girls have been sick with the 'Grenfell cough' and I've never smoked a cigarette in my life,\" he said. The Grenfell tragedy left 72 people dead and set off a series of inquiries into the response and building safety. The youngest victim was just six months old. Other buildings' cladding has been reevaluated after the fire, with residents calling for them to be removed and waking watches being set up outside some properties.\n",

      "A property manager who submitted fake building cladding safety forms has been given a suspended sentence.\n",
      "Thomas Clarke made £6,000 to fund his gambling addiction, by faking an ex-colleague's signature on crucial fire-safety documents. Two years ago, LBC revealed that leaseholders in dozens of buildings across the country trapped by the post-Grenfell cladding crisis had been sold \"forged\" building safety forms. EWS1 (External Wall System) forms were introduced after the Grenfell tragedy to access whether the high rise building with cladding was safe. The forms were required by banks, who wouldn't supply a mortgage to any flat in a building without one. In 2020, 33-year-old Thomas Clarke was contracted as a third party by Specialist Facade Inspections Ltd to survey buildings across the country. Read more: Almost 10,000 buildings 'unsafe' with danger cladding five years on from Grenfell But his membership of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors was \"on hold\", so he used the name of an ex-colleague, Sophie Magee, who had the right credentials, creating a fake email address for her and forging her signature. She was horrified in June 2020 when residents of some of these buildings started to contact her, querying her credentials and work on the forms they had received. In her victim personal statement, Ms Magee said she suffered \"significant stress\" as a result of Clarke's lies and had worked hard to build her reputation in the market. He ended up signing off a total of 55 EWS1 forms in her name, and netted £6,000. On Wednesday, Clarke, from Rainhill, Merseyside, received a 15-month custodial term, suspended for two years, after he pleaded guilty last month to fraud by false representation. Sentencing him at Liverpool Crown Court, Recorder Andrew McLoughlin said: \"The only reason you do not go to prison is that none of these forms were factually incorrect, so therefore the residents of these properties can at least be reassured.\" All were rechecked to ensure they were compliant over fire risks, the court heard, but the judge said Clarke had shown \"disdain\" to those living in high-rise buildings. He said: \"It is a very important document because it gives confidence to the occupiers of those properties about the external wall systems.\" Recorder McLoughlin told the defendant he had involved a \"completely innocent member of the public\" who had an \"unblemished\" 18-year career. He said: \"Because of underlying circumstances, a gambling addiction, you found yourself in this proverbial hole, spending more than you were actually earning, and you were in a very well-paid job. \"This was a sustained fraud with a significant degree of planning.\" Michael O'Brien, defending, said: \"He made the wrong decision at each and every turn. He offers no excuses for his behaviour.\" SFI expressed their \"relief\" at the sentence, and gratitude at this being over. They say they have learnt their lessons, and do \"a lot of thing differently now.\"\n",

      "Thomas Michael Clarke, 33, of Prescot, has been charged with fraud and false representation. The force said it comes as part of a 19-month investigation into fraudulently signed cladding paperwork. EWS1 forms were introduced after the Grenfell fire disaster that left 72 people dead in 2017. They allow residents to get their building's cladding assessed for possible fire risk. The forms need an appropriate professional to confirm the checks have been carried out, but in November 2020 residents of unnamed high-rise buildings in South Wales and London reported 88 forms had been signed off by a person who was not authorised to do so. The reports, covering time between 23 June and 12 November 2020, were referred to Merseyside Police by the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau. Without valid forms, the residents could not assess the risk to their homes and that harmed their ability to get mortgages. The correct checks have now been carried out. Mr Clarke is due to appear at Liverpool Magistrates Court on 3 August 2022. Do you have a cladding story? Email cladding@lbc.co.uk\n",

      "There are still at least 9,793 tower blocks in England that are 'unsafe' due to dangerous cladding and other associated fire risks, according to government figures obtained exclusively by LBC.\n",
      "Just days away from the five year anniversary of the Grenfell Tower Tragedy in which 72 people lost their lives, hundreds of thousands of people are still trapped in a 'cladding crisis,' with unsafe homes that they can’t sell. LBC obtained the figures after Michael Gove was unable to tell Nick Ferrari how many buildings still have flammable cladding on them.  The shocking figures reveal the extent of the cladding crisis, and show at least 903 buildings over 18m tall still have cladding systems that need to be removed. While a study last year predicted between 6,220 and 8,890 mid-rise residential buildings (11-18m in height) require remediation, partial remediation or mitigation works, officials still don't know, how many buildings four storeys or lower could be at risk. Tiago Alves escaped from Grenfell Tower with his parents and younger sister. He told LBC that by not knowing the full figures, Mr Gove exposed a complacency in Government, and that if another Grenfell happens, blame should be laid at the Government's feet. \"Yes, the same way that the Lakenhall House fire [in which 6 people died] was almost like the precursor to Grenfell, Grenfell might be the precursor to something even bigger.  \"And if the Government doesn't take any action, then we're going to be looking back on this moment and realise they could have done so much more.\"  Matt Hodges-Long, Co-Founder of Building Safety Register, an organisation campaigning for fire and life safety in all high risk buildings has called the 9,790 figure a 'scandal' but is worried the true number is even higher. \"I think there is an issue with having the wherewithal to actually conduct a survey of that type. \"But also the political willingness of understanding what that would mean when they actually saw the numbers - so I think there is an element of burying heads in sand.\" Sadiq Khan said: \"Absolutely shocking. It’s completely unacceptable that residents feel unsafe in their homes because the Government has failed to complete a single recommendation from the first phase of the Grenfell inquiry.     \"Lives are still at risk. They can’t delay action any longer.\" Michael Gove was unable to put a figure on the number of tower blocks that still have dangerous cladding when challenged on LBC yesterday. Speaking to Nick Ferrari at Breakfast on LBC, the secretary of state for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities was asked how many buildings still had flammable cladding on them. Mr Gove he said he could only provide figures for the number of buildings over 18 metres tall, which were still clad with the most dangerous product; ACM – the same cladding as was on Grenfell Tower.  But that’s only going to be a tiny proportion of the overall crisis, as 486 high rise buildings have been found to have ACM cladding.   By contrast, there have been 2,824 applications from high rise buildings alone, for Government cash from the Building Safety Fund to fix buildings with non-ACM problems.   Of those, 943 buildings are proceeding with an application for funding, just 254 buildings have started remediation work and only 30 have completed the job.  It doesn't even cover buildings below 18m. Mr Gove told Nick: “A significant number, we’ve reduced the number of buildings that are over 18 metres high that have that cladding, and there’s still much more work to do on those which are at the 11-18 metre area, which is also a cause for concern,”  “I’ve concluded negotiations with developers, we’ve got £4bn out of them in order to speed this up. “Remediation work has been far too slow but at last it’s accelerating.” Read more: Right-to-buy revolution but Gove can't say how people on benefits can afford a house But when pushed again he said he didn’t “have the numbers in front of me”. He added: “We can give you the exact figures on the number of buildings over 18 metres that have had ACM cladding removed, which is the worst type of cladding.” And asked again about figures for buildings that still do have cladding, he said: “We can give you those figures.” Tuesday marks five years since the Grenfell Tower tragedy in which 72 people lost their lives. People have shared their own stories online after Gove was stumped by Nick’s question. One person posted: “Today it's 2y 9m since our defective building was wiped out in a fire. The rebuild (our equivalent of 'remediation') hasn't even started, so probably 2yrs to go. \"The developer still hasn't come to the negotiating table with us to address compensation for residents' losses.\" Another wrote: \"Building hasn't gone public, but London, under 18m, ongoing since December 2019, developer agreed to pay since Christmas 2021 but huge delays due to PI insurance. Hopeful to start work on site autumn (maybe), work will take 12 months(ish). Looking at finishing in 2023 (maybe).\" A resident of Vista Tower in Stevenage posted: “We have waited since August 2019 when we found out the building was unsafe for work to start and have no schedule at all.  \"Just a provisional bill for £208,000 per leaseholder in our service charge.\" Another person said: \"SE London, sub-11m, timber cladding and missing cavity barriers. No funding, excluded from all support measures, at a complete impasse.\" The leader of the Fire Brigades' Union has said he's not hopeful the public inquiry into the Grenfell Tower fire will lead to significant change.  Matt Wrack told LBC he feels no one is learning lessons and the process of removing dangerous cladding has been painfully slow.\n",

Matt Wrack told LBC he feels no one is learning lessons and the process of removing dangerous cladding has been painfully slow.\n",

      "None of the recommendations from the first phase of the Grenfell inquiry have been completed by the Government, Sadiq Khan has warned.\n",
      "The Mayor of London said he was \"extremely concerned\" by the lack of progress and added that the Government and the housing sector \"must not wait\" to implement reforms. But the housing department said Mr Khan's claims were \"unfounded\". The inquiry into the Grenfell fire disaster spent its first phase examining how the blaze, in June 2017, spread throughout the 24-storey block in West London. Its next step will look into how the fire could happen.

These included hoods to help people flee smoked-out rooms, the use of tall ladders and changes to how towers are evacuated. A total of 12 recommendations over changes to the law and building regulation guidelines were sent to the Government but Mr Khan's office said no date has been put in place for when they will be completed. Mr Khan said: \"I am extremely concerned the Government has failed to complete a single recommendation from the first phase of the inquiry. \"It is vital that the Government and the housing and building industries act now and do not wait for the inquiry's next report to take action on such an important issue. \"Without faster action, the Government is failing the Grenfell community, putting lives at risk and leaving residents feeling unsafe in their homes. \"The Government, housing and building industries must not wait to implement the wholesale reforms that are needed to fix a broken system.\" Boris Johnson had previously pledged to \"legislate accordingly\" if the inquiry said steps could be taken by Government and vowed: \"I will not allow the lessons of this tragedy to fall through the cracks.\" He added that \"more widely, we plan to accept, in principle, all of the recommendations that Sir Martin [Moore-Bick, the inquiry's chairman] makes of central Government\". A housing department spokesman said: \"The Government is making progress towards implementing the Grenfell Tower Inquiry's Phase 1 recommendations. \"We're introducing the biggest improvements in building safety for a generation - with tougher regulations that will give more rights and protections for residents and make homes safer. \"Our new building safety regulator will enforce a more stringent regulatory regime for high-rise residential buildings, and oversee the safety and performance of all buildings.\"\n",

      "Thousands of people are living in dark homes shrouded in plastic, as work begins to fix the cladding on the outside of their buildings.\n",
      "The result for residents is dark, cold flats, a constant racket from builders, and another nightmare chapter in the building safety crisis, exposed by Grenfell tragedy.  \"This is like phase two of the cladding crisis\" Natalie Carter explains, as we sit in her dark living room and listen to the din of clanging metal and power-saws outside her balcony. The work was meant to be over by May but has been delayed 'indefinitely' and she is worried the situation could remain the same for the rest of the year. Large red signs stuck to the inside of her windows shout \"Danger! Construction Site\" as builders walk up and down the scaffolding.  \"Once you make it through the years of hell of realising your home is worthless and unsafe, of worrying about who pays to fix it, then this is what comes next.\" \"So we get absolutely no daylight, 24 hours a day. It could be sunny outside - raining - I wouldn't know. She says it 'messes with your brain,' leaving her \"with a combination of depression and anger.\" Despite the difficulties, she knows they are comparatively lucky. The Developer Ballymore, is covering remaining remediation costs after a fire broke out last year, injuring 40 people, but she wants to sound a warning for all other blocks that will have to have this sort of work in the future.  \"The problem is no one's given any thought to the mental and physical health of the people forced to live through this level of construction and remediation.\" Soon, her windows and doors will be sealed shut, there will be no fresh air, leaving her home unbearably sweltering in the summer. Although right now, some of her neighbours have the opposite problem, as removing cladding strips back vital insulation. Andrew and his wife Jo both work from home and have resorted to living in the only warm room of the flat. She greets me in several jumpers, a blanket, and a hot water bottle, he explains they have to keep all doors shut, and the heating on almost constantly.  Energy bills have already gone up by 60%, but now they have the heating on all the time, he's too scared to check the meter reading. Natalie says they asked about being rehomed, but it would cost far too much. Especially as, in the rush to get the cladding off, they've hit major scheduling delays: \"There's problems getting scaffolding, there's problems getting scaffolders. There's problems with getting key skilled workers, and now the latest is even though the building safety fund set a milestone for the end of last year to remove the dangerous cladding, there's no replacement cladding. There are no materials. They’re coming from Europe, so we have no idea when they're actually going to show up. \"We just don't know, is this a two month delay - a six month delay - a year? All the while we're deprived of daylight, listening to this interminable sound.  \"It's not good enough. For the benefit of all the thousands of buildings to come; the Government, builders, companies involved need to think about the fact that people have to live here while all this is happening.\"  Ballymore said in a statement: “Cladding remediation works are underway across Ballymore’s developments and will be completed as quickly as possible.  \"We will continue to do all we can to minimise disruption for residents as works are completed.  \"It is our intention that leaseholders at New Providence Wharf will not bear any of the costs of cladding remediation.\"\n",

      "The proposed building, which is being planned as part of a development for 1,760 new homes in west London, would have flats in up to 35 storeys - 11 more than Grenfell. Planning documents show that the tower will rely on the same \"stay put\" fire strategy used during the Grenfell Tower fire in which 72 people died, The Guardian reported. Under current building regulations, tall buildings can have just one single staircase if designed so that residents can stay safely in their flats during a fire.

Bereaved and survivors group Grenfell United said: \"Not enough has been done since Grenfell to improve building safety.\" A Hammersmith and Fulham Council spokesperson said: \"The safety of residents is our number one priority. \"We take a tough line with developers to ensure that anything they build is fully compliant with all safety and other regulations as a minimum, and that local people are fully consulted.\" A London Fire Brigade spokesperson said: \"We are aware of this development and we will be providing a response to the planning consultation.\" URW have been approached for comment.\n",

He said that they relied on building owners coming forward to say their buildings needed work, suggesting thousands were impacted. \"We can't be absolutely precise about the exact number in the scope,\" Mr Gove said. \"That is one of the things that I hope we can do in conversation with owners and with developers at the moment.\" He went on to say: \"We know we're talking about just over 100,000 flats in the scope.\" It comes as it was announced that developers will need to produce a £4 billion plan to tackle the crisis by early March or risk the introduction of a new law.

Mr Gove also said that \"in almost every case\" buildings between zero and 11 metres high would be \"safe in fire terms\". He added: \"It's important - and one of the reasons why I've been talking to the national fire chief council and others - that we, as quickly and authoritatively as possible, make sure that we can provide people with confidence. \"There is also a new handy guide that we're producing today which will enable any surveyors or any appropriate professional to conduct an audit of a building in order to assess whether or not it is safe in fire safety terms.\"\n",

Instead, it has been reported the government will try to secure up to £4bn from developers towards the costs. It had already promised to pay to remove cladding in taller buildings. If ministers are unable to secure the funding from developers it may come out of the housing department's budget, it has been reported. Only leaseholders in buildings taller than 18 metres can currently access grants to replace unsafe cladding under measures introduced in England after the Grenfell Tower fire killed 72 people in 2017.

      "For example, buildings may be built shorter than 18 meters as those that are taller than that are considered \"high-rise\" and therefore require more advanced safety measures, according to assistant commissioner of the London Fire Brigade (LFB) Paul Jennings. \"We have got examples where we think people are deliberately designing and building their buildings below that 18 metre, six floor threshold because they know if they reach that threshold they would have to put advanced and more intricate fire safety measures in,\" he told the BBC.

The London Fire Brigade's warning comes after the Housing Secretary, Michael Gove, made his first appearance in front of a committee of MPs who asked questions about building safety. On Monday, Mr Gove told the Housing, Communities and Local Government Committee: \"We collectively - the department, some in local government, others in the private sector - failed people at Grenfell and there are people who were and still are in buildings where there is a significant risk.\" He went on to say that, as the Grenfell Inquiry turned its attention to the Government's role in the disaster, his department \"will be seen to have, on a couple of occasions, not necessarily appreciated the importance of fire safety\".

The Housebuilders Federation, which represents housing developers, told Newsnight: \"Developers meet the building regulations set by Government without exception. \"Standards today are considerably more exacting than previous iterations. Building regulations differ dependent on the type of building, but all have residents safety at their core.\" The Government said: \"The safety and wellbeing of residents is our priority and the Building Safety Bill will strengthen oversight and protections for everyone in high rise buildings. \"All new buildings of any height must meet building regulations fire safety requirements and we have already banned the use of all combustible materials on external walls of new residential buildings over 18 metres.\"\n",

      "Hundreds of protesters gathered in Parliament Square on Thursday to demand the Government \"steps in\" to make their homes safe. They want the cladding removed from the buildings they live in without facing exorbitant fees to do so.  Steph Pike, a lawyer from Bristol, told LBC she was protesting because she faces a five-figure bill to pay for work to remove cladding from her home. \"If I was asked to pay £70,000 in say 28 days, which I possibly could be, I obviously couldn't afford that – I think I'd have to really seriously consider bankruptcy.

Someone really needs to take charge.\" The Government has set aside £5 billion to spend on building safety, with £3.5 billion to go to removing unsafe cladding for all leaseholders who live in residential buildings that are at least 18 metres high. Another scheme exists for smaller buildings. It said that no leaseholder under the scheme should pay more than £50 a month towards removing unsafe cladding.  The Housing Ministry said: \"We're spending over £5 billion to fund the replacement of unsafe cladding in the highest risk buildings and are making the biggest improvements to building safety in a generation. \"We've been clear throughout that building owners and industry should make buildings safe without passing on costs to leaseholders – and our new measures will legally require owners of high-rise buildings to prove they have tried all routes to cover the cost of essential safety works. \"Alongside this, our ambitious leasehold reforms will benefit millions of homeowners by ending unfair practices in the leasehold market and delivering on our commitment to set ground rents to zero on new leases.\" The protesters took to Parliament Square on Michael Gove's first day as housing secretary, having been given the job in Wednesday's reshuffle. Ms Pike said: \"We've been told that the cost to remediate our building is £7.6 million and that's split between just over 100 leaseholders.  \"My bill's expected to be around £70,000 and that doesn't even include a waking watch, or the fire alarm or any interim measures.  \"I don't know when it's gong to land or exactly how much it's going to be and I don't know whether they're going to charge it all in one go. It's so uncertain.\" LBC's Rachael Venables said she also spoke to one person who has been suffering from PTSD and wakes up at night fearing for her family.

      "People whose homes have been blighted by fire safety problems and dangerous cladding will protest outside Parliament on Thursday.\n",
      "Leaseholders from Manchester, Liverpool and surrounding areas will march on the capital later demanding help from the government over repair bills. Many have been hit with eye-watering costs for problems they did not know they had upon moving into their properties. After the Grenfell Tower tragedy four years ago, which left 72 people dead, many buildings were reviewed and found to be encased in potentially lethal cladding, similar to what was used on the North Kensington tower block. Read more: People stuck in ‘unsellable’ flats months after having cladding removed Read more: Grenfell - council official 'regrets' not asking about cladding fire safety Residents across the country have since been left to foot the life-changing bills to remove the material, with little support coming from ministers. Earlier in the year, campaigners were told early details of the government's cladding loan scheme. It will offer long-term loans against flats in buildings between 11 and 18 metres tall, capped at £50 a month, to pay to remove dangerous cladding. However, LBC revealed that the scheme will be included in the already-delayed Building Safety Bill, which could take a year to fully pass and even longer to implement, according to industry experts. Read more: Loan scheme to remove cladding from low-rises 'could take years to set up' Read more: Labour hits out at delay to Government's cladding loan scheme Many residents cannot wait that long, with some facing bankruptcies and evictions, and are taking matters into their own hands by protesting in London on Thursday. The Leaseholders Together demonstration, which is part of the End Our Cladding Scandal campaign, is set to start at 1pm in Parliament Square. Campaigners are calling on the government to implement building safety reforms, act faster and fix the injustices they are facing. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan is expected to give a speech at around 2pm, two hours before the event wraps up. Ahead of the protest, Giles Grover, of Manchester Cladiators, said: \"It's exhausting really, and that's whether you're a leaseholder, a resident facing the bills, or just worried about your own building. \"You're worried about your life and how you're going to cope with it.\" A post on the End Our Cladding Scandal website reads: \"Our fight is not just about cladding. It’s about all things leasehold. It’s the thing that ties us all together. \"The rally will see a range of MPs and speakers take to the stage and with your help will send a clear message to Government that enough is enough.\" The demonstration falls on the same day as an All-Party Parliamentary Group meeting on leaseholds. A spokesperson from the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: \"We have already introduced legislation to free future leaseholders of the additional costs associated with new leases, and we welcome the Competition Markets Authority’s continued success in securing agreements with developers to remove doubling ground rents for existing leaseholders. “This will ensure leaseholders are given the fair treatment they deserve, and we strongly urge other developers to follow suit.”\n",

      "A teacher has been sacked after their joke about 'whacking' a pupil over the head was not understood.\n",
      "Baiklautchmee Subrian, who has over 35 years' experience as a teacher, was sacked after a child who spoke English as a second language misunderstood the comment. She was dismissed from Gilbert Colvin Primary School in Ilford, east London, in 2023 following the incident. Ms Subrian took the school to an employment tribunal, claiming the remark had been made \"in jest\" while teaching Year 6 pupils and preparing them for their maths SAT exam, according to the Times. Almost everyone in the class knew it was not intended to be unkind, she said. Read more: Pensioner arrested over 'Day of the Jackal threat to kill PM' posted on social media Read more: Social media companies to be 'named and shamed' for not protecting women and girls online, Ofcom chief tells LBC During the lesson, one pupil asked what would happen if they did not hold their papers in place during their tests. Ms Subrian responded saying that she would \"whack\" them while gesturing with her hand. The pupil felt threatened, upset and angry over the remark and told another teacher, the hearing was told. The following day, Ms Subrian was asked to meet the head of school and told that there would be an investigation into the incident. Speaking at a disciplinary hearing in July 2023, she said that the child's decision to continue attending her after-school club showed that they had not been that upset. However, in a letter of dismissal sent later that same month, it said due to the pupil not having English as a first language they \"could not be expected to understand\". Ms Subrian has argued that the punishment was too severe and claimed the school's investigation 'lacked integrity'. However, her claim of unfair dismissal was rejected at her employment tribunal in east London. Judge Jack Feeny said in his closing comments: \"I do not consider whether or not the comment was intended as a joke to be particularly important. It was plainly an inappropriate thing to say. \"The accompanying hand gesture compounded matters, particularly where at least some of the children did not have English as a first language. \"A teacher may get away with a comment in these circumstances if all children receive it as a light-hearted comment and laugh along. It is common ground that this was not what happened here. \"The risk of making such a joke is that if even only one child is upset by it, it must amount to a significant safeguarding issue.\"\n",

      "Delivering an address to Parliament on Tuesday, Sir Keir Starmer announced a boost in UK defence spending to 2.5 per cent of GDP by 2027. \n",
      "This bombshell announcement comes ahead of crucial talks with Donald Trump in Washington later this week.  Sir Keir said Britain should be proud of its support for Ukraine in the wake of Putin's invasion but must do more as tensions rise across Europe. To pay for this £13.4 billion defence hike, Labour will slash foreign aid, just one of the many \"hard choices\" Britain will face in the coming years, Starmer said.  \"Russia is a menace in our waters, in our airspace and on our streets,\" he told the Commons.  He added: \"We must find courage in our history, courage in who we are as a nation, because courage is what our own era now demands of us. Read more: UK should spend 3% of GDP on defence and could send up to 10,000 troops to Ukraine, Boris Johnson tells LBC \"So starting today, I can announce this Government will begin the biggest sustained increase in defence spending since the end of the Cold War. \"We will deliver our commitment to spend 2.5%. of GDP on defence, but we will bring it forward so that we reach that level in 2027, and we will maintain that for the rest of this Parliament. \"And let me spell it out, that means spending £13.4 billion more on defence every year from 2027.\" Even this is not far enough, Starmer continued as he pledged to raise spending to 3 per cent of GDP by the next Parliament.  \"At moments like these in our past Britain has stood up to be counted, it has come together and demonstrated strength. \"That is what the security of our country needs now and it is what we will deliver\" Starmer warned \"tyrants\" like Russian President Vladimir Putin \"only respond to strength\". He told MPs: \"We should not pretend that any of this has been easy. Working people have already felt the cost of Russian actions through rising prices and bills.  \"Nonetheless, one of the great lessons of our history is that instability in Europe will always wash up on our shores, and that tyrants like Putin only respond to strength. \"Russia is a menace in our waters, in our airspace and on our streets. They have launched cyber attacks on our NHS, only seven years ago a chemical weapons attack on the streets of Salisbury. \"We must stand by Ukraine, because if we do not achieve a lasting peace, then the economic instability are threats to our security, they will only grow. \"And so as the nature of that conflict changes, as it has in recent weeks, it brings our response into sharper focus, a new era that we must meet as we have so often in the past, together, and with strength.\" The British people may face hard choices to pay for this defence hike, the PM warned.  \"I equally want to be very clear that like any other investment we make, we must seek value for money and that's why we're putting in place a new defence, reform and efficiency plan, jointly led by my right honourable friends the Chancellor (Rachel Reeves) and the Defence Secretary (John Healey). \"This investment means that the UK will strengthen its position as a leader in Nato and in the collective defence of our continent, and we should welcome that role. \"It is good for our national security. It is also good for the defining mission of this Government - to restore growth to our economy.\" This bombshell commitment comes ahead of crucial talks with President Trump later this week.  The meeting is backdropped by rising tensions in Europe, with the US seemingly abandoning its commitments to NATO and Ukraine since Trump took office.  Tory leader Kemi Badenoch urged Sir Keir Starmer to avoid tax rises or borrowing more money to fund the defence budget. She told the Commons: \"Can the Prime Minister say in confidence that 2.5% by 2027 is sufficient because we need to look at exactly how we fund this. \"He must not raise taxes further as it will destroy our economy, we need a strong economy to pay for strong defence.  \t\"He cannot borrow more, we are already spending more on debt interest than defence. We all know that he must make difficult decisions on spending, he has our support to do that.\"\n",

      "Police said they were called to 32 Portland Place, known for notorious sex parties, at 7am on Sunday morning following reports of an assault. A group of men used knives to stab party-goers during the fight, according to The Sun. The mansion is where OnlyFans star Bonnie Blue recently slept with more than 1,000 men in 12 hours. A source told The Sun: “There was blood everywhere with people lying injured all over the place. “It looked like a battle scene rather than a sex club.” Met officers attended along with the London Ambulance service and four people were taken to hospital. Three of the victims had been stabbed, police said. Their injuries are not believed to be life threatening. Three men were arrested, one on suspicion of GBH and possession with intent to supply, one man on suspicion of GBH and another man on suspicion of possession with intent to supply.  Police said they had imposed a Section 76 Closure Notice “to prevent further disruption to the local area,” which allows them to shutter the property for up to 48 hours.

Magistrates were told last year that police had been dispatched to the address 63 times over the last few years. Neighbours have said they have suffered years of extremely loud music, revellers taking drugs and vomiting in the street. Last December, Davenport flew back from Thailand to successfully challenge the closure order at City of London Magistrates’ Court. He denies hosting all-night parties, saying he hosts art shows there every months with around 100 people, but that gatherings do not go on beyond midnight. He also denied any drug-taking at the mansion. “I am very anti-drugs, I don’t drink, I have had two kidney transplants,” he said. “Nobody would be smoking marijuana in my house. “I am absolutely certain there is no illegal activity (at the parties).” Magistrate Mr Gowlett said at the time: “We do not find the case for closure has been proved on balance of probability, and therefore refuse the order that is sought.”\n",

Anyone with a hazelnut allergy who unwittingly ate these products could face serious health problems. Around 2% of children and 0.5% of adults in the UK have a tree nut allergy, according to Allergy UK.

The affected batches of Cheshire Farm's 1L Biscoff Ice Cream tubs are under codes L23139, with a best before date of 19 November, 2024, and L23261, with a best before date of 18 March, 2025. The affected batch of Caramelized Biscuit Ice Cream was sold under the code L24150, with the best before date of 29 November, 2025. Cheshire Farm said that anyone who had bought these products should not eat them if they have a nut allergy, and instead should take them back to the shop for a refund. The company warned: \"If you have bought the above products and have an allergy to nuts do not eat them.\" Cheshire Farm also said it did not have any affiliation with the Lotus Biscoff brand and its ice cream does not contain any Biscoff products.\n",

Following the defeat to the Hammers - after which he criticised his players for failing to reach the standards required to end the club's 21-year wait for the title - Arteta conceded the championship race was no longer in his hands. Read More: Galatasaray accuse Fenerbahce boss Jose Mourinho of making 'racist statements' Read More: Moise Kean update after ex-Everton star rushed to hospital after collapsing on the pitch But speaking on the eve of Arsenal's trip to third-placed Forest, the Spaniard said: \"I'm not going to stop, over my dead body. \"If I think that way, I'll go home. Mathematically, it's possible. You are there. You have to play every game. Suddenly, three days ago, we could close the gap to five points. It doesn't matter. We have to continue to go. \"The difficulty is higher than it was. But if you want to win the the Premier League, you're going to have to do something special. You're probably going to have to do something that nobody else has done in the history of the Premier League.\" Arsenal's bid to win the title has been derailed by a series of injuries, with Kai Havertz and Gabriel Jesus out for the season. Bukayo Saka is due to return next month having been sidelined since December, while Gabriel Martinelli is also currently unavailable. Captain Martin Odegaard missed 12 games with an ankle injury earlier in the campaign, while Arsenal have also battled suspensions. Five players have been sent off in their 26 league games so far. The Gunners have been Liverpool's closest challengers this season, and have progressed to the last 16 of the Champions League, but Arteta believes his side could easily have been dumped out of Europe and left battling in mid-table. He continued: \"If somebody tells you at the start of the season, by this time, you have played five times with a red card over half an hour in each of those games, and you have lost this amount of players, what's the bet? You are in the middle of the table, at least, and you are out of the Champions League. \"That's not the situation. So that tells you the resilience, the resources, the ambition that the team has, every individual has, and that has been probably been one of the proudest moments in my time to work. \"It was a very disappointing weekend. In the previous 15 games, we have won 10 and drawn five, exactly the same as Liverpool, with exactly the same goal difference, which is plus 23. \"We have been extremely consistent for the last three and a half months, considering everything that we've been through, and we have generated that momentum. \"When you are trying to build that momentum and we're putting so much into it, especially with the circumstances that we have, the defeat against West Ham was a very hard one to take. On top of that, they (Liverpool) win. \"But the reality is that there's so many games to play, and you have to get back to it. You're going to have to set a certain amount of numbers to win this league.\"And we're going to have to hit that number if we're going to have any chance of doing that. But we're certainly going to continue to try.\"  \n",

      "Ms Pritchard has announced she will stand down at the end of the financial year, saying it was a \"hugely difficult decision\".  \t In a statement, she said: \"It has been an enormous privilege to lead the NHS in England through what has undoubtedly been the most difficult period in its history.  \t \"I am immensely proud of the NHS response to Covid-19, and how we have delivered steady recovery from the inevitable impacts of the pandemic, with performance in urgent and emergency care, elective and cancer all improving over the past two years, while NHS teams delivered record levels of activity in primary care, community and mental health services, meaning millions more appointments for patients.  \t \"We always knew the recovery period after a once-in-a-century pandemic was going to be incredibly challenging, and whilst the timeliness and experience of care is still not good enough for too many people, the NHS has achieved a great deal in the face of historic pressure thanks to a relentless focus on innovation and reform.  \t \"From the rollout of Community Diagnostic Centres and mental health teams in schools, to world leading cancer vaccines and the development of the App, the NHS now feels very different to when I became chief executive over three and a half years ago.  \t \"While it has been a hugely difficult decision for me to stand down, I believe now is the right time, with the NHS making continued progress in our recovery, and with the foundations firmly in place to deliver the 10-Year Health Plan.  \t \"The NHS is full of extraordinary people, who do extraordinary things every day for patients.  \"The achievements I have listed above, and many more, are theirs - and I am confident they will continue to achieve incredible things for patients now, and into the future.\" Health Secretary Wes Streeting has said Ms Pritchard should be \"enormously proud of the leadership\" she's given the NHS. \"She steered NHS England out of the pandemic, during turbulent political waters and six secretaries of state.   \"She has led with integrity and unwavering commitment,\" he added.

      "The club said it would also submit complaints to governing bodies UEFA and FIFA after the Fenerbahce boss's comments following Monday's 0-0 draw between the top two sides. The former Chelsea, Manchester United, Tottenham and Real Madrid manager made comments about the Galatasaray bench \"jumping like monkeys\" after an early challenge and the match being better because it was not officiated by a Turkish referee.

The Portuguese was charged with \"unsportsmanlike behaviour towards opposing team fans\" and \"diminishing the value of Turkish football and... discrediting the impartiality of the referees and other match officials\" during an outspoken post-match interview.\n",

      "-------\n",
      "The head of Ofcom has told LBC that the regulator will \"name and shame\" social media companies that fail to protect women and girls in the UK adequately.\n",
      "Melanie Dawes, who runs the communications regulator, told LBC's Nick Ferrari at Breakfast that women face \"a real culture of misogyny, harassment [and] intimate image abuse\". She was describing Ofcom's plans to \"shine a light\" on tech companies that fail to be proactive in making their sites safer and easier to use, especially for women and girls. The regulator is consulting on new guidance on measures tech firms should use to help better protect women and girls on their sites. These will include the better use of technology to prevent intimate image abuse, as well as a request for sites to consider introducing tools which would help spot and fix ways they can be exploited by abusers. Dawes said the problem was even more widespread than some might think. \"When I talk to women, you know, what's so striking is this isn't a niche issue, this isn't about just vulnerable women, it's actually about ordinary women going about their daily lives online,\" she said. She claimed that women are \"five times more likely than men to have intimate image abuse against them, much more likely to have harassments or pile-ons just for expressing an opinion.  \"So it's fundamentally about people's freedom of speech not actually being a real thing online, if you're a woman in the UK, in the same way as it is for men.\" The guidance joins already published legally binding codes of practice on illegal content and protecting children online that have already been put in place by Ofcom. These will begin to take effect next month under the Online Safety Act, and which carry large financial penalties if found to have been breached. Dawes said it was unclear to what extent the tech firms themselves would take action when the Online Safety Act comes in, and how much Ofcom would need to enforce. \"It's a six million dollar question how much action is going to come and how much are we going to need to drive through with enforcement action,\" she said. \"We're ready for that. But this is a big cultural change for the industry. There's a lot to fix. So all eyes now on the tech industry as far as I'm concerned.\" Dawes said in an earlier statement that the new guidance was a \"call to action for online services\". \"There's not only a moral imperative for tech firms to protect the interests of female users, but it also makes sound commercial sense - fostering greater trust and engagement with a significant proportion of their customer base,\" she said.\" Dawes' colleague Jessica Smith, who led the development of the guidance, said the regulator was also prepared to use its powers under the Online Safety Act to highlight platforms not doing enough to protect women and girls on their sites through new online safety transparency reports. \"Effectively, what we are going to do is use our information-gathering and transparency powers,\" she told the PA news agency. \"So one of the things we're committing to do is, once the guidance is finalised and a sufficient period of time has passed, is we'll publish a transparency report that shines a light on what platforms are doing and not doing to keep their users safe. \"It's about putting information out there, so users can be informed and make a choice about where they spend their time online.\" She added: \"What we're saying to platforms today is that you have a commercial choice. \"We know that women spend longer online than men, for example, on a daily basis, and so we think it makes good commercial sense to take their safety seriously. \"For some platforms, they may not choose to do that, and that is their decision. But as I said, then we will make sure people know what kind of space they are entering into when they go on that kind of platform.\" Under the Online Safety Act, platforms will be legally required to follow a new set of duties around protecting users from harm online, with fines of up to 10% of global turnover for those who fail to do so - which could run into billions of pounds for the largest services. New regulation of the online world has been broadly welcomed, but some charities and campaigners have warned that the current plans have taken too long to implement, and do not go far enough to protect users from harm. In response, Ms Smith said: \"We're at the fairly early days when it comes to implementation of the Act. \"I think we're still at the stage of testing and implementing the powers that we have now, and I know that this has taken a while, so I really understand people's frustration. \"I think when it comes to this particular guidance, we are balancing quite difficult issues. There are issues around free expression.\" As well as women and girls, Ms Smith said it was vital the regulator also heard from men and boys on the issues raised. \"Obviously, this guidance is focused on women and girls, and we've spoken to a lot of survivors and women's advocacy organisations as part of the process, but it's also for men and boys - these tools can be for everybody,\" she said. \"We know boys are more exposed to online misogyny than girls are, so we think that this will have broader benefits and we're keen to speak to men and boys as part of our consultation process.\"\n",

      "Robotics company Ocean Infinity is looking for the wreckage of the plane on the seabed of the Indian Ocean, 1,200 miles off the western Australian city of Perth. Its deep-water support vessel Armada 7806 deployed autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) at the search site. These are operated via satellite from a control room at the company's headquarters in Southampton. If the wreckage is found, then Ocean Infinity can also send out remote vehicles to help recover it, also to be controled remotely. The mission may represent the last hope of finding MH370, which disappeared on March 8, 2014 after taking off from Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur for a flight to Beijing.

All 239 people who were on board are presumed dead - but none have been found, and there is no conclusive explanation for what happened. Two major search operations were launched, one from 2014-2017, and another in 2018, neither of which found the aircraft. Several pieces of debris washed up onshore in the years following the disappearance, some of which were confirmed to belong to MH370. Ocean Infinity was previously in talks with the Malaysian government for a £55 million payout if it found the wreckage, operating on a 'no-find, no-fee' basis. But no agreement is thought to have been finalised, and the Telegraph reported that the company was operating on its own account. Ocean Infinity founder Oliver Plunkett has described finding the wreckage as his life's ambition. A previous mission by the company in 2018 was abandoned without success. This mission, due to last four weeks, will focus on an arc in the southern Indian Ocean where the plane is thought to have come down. Ocean Infinity will scour up to four sites where the plane may have crashed, including one where earlier searches may not have given enough attention. The total search area is thought to be around 5,800 square miles.\n",

      "A cameraman for a controversial BBC documentary about life in Gaza has been accused of ‘celebrating’ the October 7 massacre.\n",
      "Hatem Rawagh is reported to have praised the terror attack on social media. He tweeted about the 1973 Yom Kippur war - when Egypt and Syria attacked Israel. In the post he said: “Whoever missed Oct 6 in Egypt...Oct 7 is happening in Palestine.” He went on to post online apparently celebrating the killing of an Israeli soldier.  He captioned a video of a gunman: “You are going back to this video a million times.” The video was originally posted by Hamas’s al-Qassam brigades. It depicts the point of view of a gunman killing a soldier in Erez, near the Gaza border. He also shared celebrations at the Omari mosque in Gaza in April 2023 after a car attack in Tel Aviv which killed an Italian tourist and left seven others injured.

The documentary was made by the BBC's Current Affair TV arm which paid award-winning Hoyo Films to make it. Former director of BBC television Danny Cohen said: \"The BBC needs to account for every penny spent on this documentary - £400,000 is a lot of licence-fee payers money.  \"They should be transparently told where their money went and whether any of it reached the hands of Hamas. \"The BBC must also launch a wider investigation into systemic bias against Israel after repeated editorial failures since the October 7 massacres.\" The BBC initially kept the documentary online with an added disclaimer before removing it from iPlayer while conducting further ‘due diligence’. It is co-directed by Jamie Roberts, an Emmy-award-winning filmmaker, and Yousef Hammash, a Bafta-award-winning Palestinian journalist. It was filmed by two cameramen which Mr Rawagh hired as an “additional camera.” Mr Rawagh’s tweets were uncovered by the Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting and Analysis (Camera). A spokesman for Camera said: “These posts appear to be glorifying the horrific terrorist acts committed on October 7, 2023. Anyone who wrote them has no place working for the BBC. Here is yet more evidence of the editorial failings in the documentary for which the BBC must answer.” An internal report into the programme will be presented to the BBC board on Thursday. The corporation is expected to announce a summary of findings either on Thursday or by Friday morning. According to the Telegraph, the programme was viewed by Jo Carr, the BBC’s head of current affairs, prior to broadcast. She described the documentary as a “story of immense consequence” in a press release issued on Jan 20. A BBC spokesman said: “Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone features important stories we think should be told – those of the experiences of children in Gaza. There have been continuing questions raised about the programme and in the light of these, we are conducting further due diligence with the production company. The programme will not be available on iPlayer while this is taking place.”\n",

      "Police searches in the River Dee in Aberdeen to trace two sisters who disappeared earlier this month have come to an end.\n",
      "Eliza and Henrietta Huszti were last seen on January 7 at 2.12am in Market Street at Victoria Bridge. Their disappearance prompted a major search and rescue mission but officers have been unable to find the pair nearly three weeks on.

But the force said wider inquiries to find the sisters are ongoing, including searches of coastal areas in the north and south of Aberdeen. Earlier, officers said the two women had visited the bridge where they were last seen the day before their disappearance. They were seen at Victoria Bridge at around 2.50pm on January 6. CCTV shows the sisters, who are part of a set of triplets, spent five minutes at the footpath and Victoria Bridge but did not engage with anyone else. It also emerged a text message was sent from Henrietta's mobile phone to the sisters' landlady at 2.12am on January 7, from the area of Victoria Bridge, indicating they would not be returning to the flat. The phone was then disconnected from the network and has not been active since, police said. The following day, the sisters' personal belongings were found in the flat and the landlady reported her concerns to police. After visiting the bridge on January 6, CCTV footage shows the sisters making their way through the city centre, via the Union Square shopping centre, back to their flat in the Charlotte Street area. Police said there is nothing to indicate they left it again until shortly before they were last seen at the River Dee. When they were last seen on January 7 they crossed the bridge and turned right on to a footpath next to the river heading towards Aberdeen Boat Club.\n",

Police have launched an urgent appeal for information that could lead to the whereabouts of the family as they continue their search.

      "A leading Scottish Conservative councillor has defected to Reform UK, just days after his party leader Russell Findlay admitted he feared an exodus of his members to Nigel Farage's party.\n",
      "Thomas Kerr, who has represented the Shettleston ward in Glasgow's deprived East End since 2017 - and led the Conservative group on the city council - is the biggest scalp taken by Reform UK in Scotland. The party now has five councillors in Scotland, after former independent councillors - who had already quit the Scottish Conservatives - joined up. And Reform UK sources have told LBC there are \"more to come.\" Kerr was seen as a rising star in the Scottish Conservative ranks, and had stood as candidate in the Rutherglen and Hamilton West by-election in 2023 but lost to Labour's Michael Shanks. He said: “Joining Reform UK is a significant turning point for me. My own experiences with addiction, losing my father and watching my mother recover, have shaped my desire to make real, lasting change. \"I am committed to ensuring that every person in Scotland who is struggling with addiction has access to the support and recovery services they need to rebuild their lives. \"Reform UK represents the change our communities desperately need, and I’m excited to continue my work for Shettleston with this dynamic new party.” A Reform UK spokesperson said it welcomed the move from Kerr saying he had \"proven himself as a dedicated leader, committed to making a real difference.\" He added: \"Thomas is dedicated to fighting for social mobility and offering a voice to communities that have been failed by the political establishment for far too long. \"This is an exciting chapter for Reform UK, as we continue to build momentum across Scotland. Thomas Kerr’s joining our party is a sign of the growing demand for real, practical change, change that delivers real solutions for the people of Scotland.\" A party source told LBC that there were more defections to come, but wouldn't specify if they were at council or Holyrood level, or when they might jump. On Monday after delivering a keynote speech Scottish Conservative leader Russell Findlay was asked about potential defections to Reform, which in the latest poll is neck-and-neck with his party on 15% for the next Holyrood elections. He said: \"There's always a risk in any party where colleagues might feel disillusioned, and this is why it's my job to persuade people that we get it, that we need to rebuild trust, it's going to be a long and difficult process, but I don't want any one to be tempted by going elsewhere.\" \n",

      "The Scottish government has been slammed for denying children in nurseries birthday cakes, sweets and other treats in a ban set to be imposed this summer. \n",
      "\n",
      "New guidance drawn up by the SNP is aimed at helping young people cut out \"unhealthy foods”. It comes after 2022 estimates revealed around 6% of children in Scotland were at risk of having weight problems. The ban, which is also set to include fish finger, chicken nuggets and other deep fried goods, will be imposed from August 1. The full set of guidance can be found in the SNP’s 108-page Setting the Table report. Chips, sweet treats like chocolate and fruit juice, will also be banned, as will other popular goodies like spaghetti hoops and cereals with over 15g of sugar per 100g, and most breads.

Childcare providers will only be allowed to give youngsters water and milk to drink, with smoothies also off the cards. Critics have flooded in to slam the report. X user Agent P wrote: “No, it’s not April 1st. “The SNP really are going to bnan birthday cakes in nurseries. “What a joyless place they have turned Scotland into.” Scotland’s Conservative Party spokesman has blasted the “draconian`” rules as an example of “nanny state overreach.” He said: “Everybody wants to promote healthier eating, especially when children are young. “But it won’t happen by imposing such draconian rules or blanket prohibitions. “These guidelines risk becoming an onerous requirement for childminders and nurseries. “And most people will see things like a ban on birthday cake as the worst kind of nanny state overreach.” The report reads: “Many families like to celebrate their child’s birthday and other special events, often by bringing in a cake or sweets to the childcare setting to share. \"Unfortunately, this can mean that some children are eating these unhealthy foods several times; this may be at the childminder’s house, in the nursery or playgroup as well as at home.\" Martin Whitfield, the Scottish Labour Children and Young Person’s spokesman has said the rules are “out of proportion. He said: “It’s right that nurseries and playgroups promote healthy-eating habits but this heavy-handed approach seems out of all proportion. “The Scottish government should support nurseries to offer healthy choices instead of forging ahead with this sweeping ban.” The Scottish government argued the guidance was developed alongside experts in child health and nutrition. The report reads: “Many families like to celebrate their child’s birthday and other special events, often by bringing in a cake or sweets to the childcare setting to share. “Unfortunately, this can mean that some children are eating these unhealthy foods several times a week...An alternative way of celebrating the occasion should be adopted and be part of your food and nutrition policy.” The rules will be imposed by Scotland’s care watchdog - the Care Inspectorate - which will “expect registered childcare providers to be able to demonstrate how they are meeting this guidance” during routine inspections, according to the Mail. The Care Inspectorate said: “Nutritional options provided by care services have always been a part of our inspections.” It comes amid a boom in the scientific as well as health and fitness communities raising the awareness about ultra-processed foods.  Research into the impact of these unhealthy goods has found that the UK's reliance on foods high in sugar, salt, and fat, is having a 'devastating' impact. A study by the Food, Farming and Countryside Commission (FOC) report found the UK's estimated spend of £268bn can be explained by three areas: NHS spend (£67.5bn), welfare system (£10.1bn) and social care services (£14.3bn).The finances go towards treating diet-related diseases.  These include type 2 diabetes, kidney disease, and cardiovascular problems.Meanwhile in May, researchers at Harvard University tracked 115,000 healthy US adults over the course of three decades. They found a link between eating ultra-processed foods (UPFs) and the risk of dying. The most harmful diets contain high amounts of ready-made processed meat and fish products. These diets increased the risk of death by 13 per cent.  Food in this category includes items like shop-bought sausages, burgers, fish fingers, chicken nuggets and turkey twizzlers.\n",

      "In a post on her Instagram, the former First Minister of Scotland \"confirmed\" the pair had \"decided to end our marriage\". The couple got married in 2010, but in her post Nicola Sturgeon revealed that they had privately split some time ago. Read More: Nicola Sturgeon accused of 'hypocrisy' over £25k payment for General Election night appearance Read More: Nicola Sturgeon breaks silence after husband Peter Murrell charged in SNP finance probe Once seen as a political power couple when they both had the top jobs in the SNP, there had been growing speculation they had separated. Neither had been seen at their house on the outskirts of Glasgow for some time, and she is believed to have moved to a flat in Edinburgh's New Town. She has also been posting photographs from social events she has attended in recent months, but Peter Murrell never featured.  Their relationship has been under extreme pressure as a result of the Police Scotland investigation Operation Branchform into the SNP's finances. Murrell, who was the party's chief executive for 20 years, has been charged with alleged embezzlement, but the Crown Office is yet to decide if a prosecution will go ahead.  The police inquiry is also still ongoing, almost four years since it began. In her post, Nicola Sturgeon wrote: \"With a heavy heart I am confirming that Peter and I have decided to end our marriage. \"To all intents and purposes we have been separated for some time now and feel it is time to bring others up to speed with where we are. \"It goes without saying that we still care deeply for each other, and always will. \"We will be making no further comment.\" The announcement comes 16 months after she said in an interview \"we will be married for a long time to come.\" Nicola Sturgeon, who still sits as an SNP MSP in Holyrood, has also been questioned by police in connection with Operation Branchform, as has the then SNP treasurer, Colin Beattie. In December, Ms Sturgeon said she knows \"nothing more\" about the investigation than she did when arrested and she was “getting on with my life as best I can.\" She has also insisted that “beyond doubt” she was “innocent of any wrongdoing”. The couple first met back in 1988 when she was just 18 years old at an SNP youth event and they officially became a couple in 2003. They got married seven years later in July 2010 at Oran Mor in Glasgow. When she became party leader in 2014, she dismissed any suggestion her husband should stand aside from his role, despite internal concerns from some in the SNP. An SNP source said at the time: \"It's not ideal, especially looked at from outside. The perception is that it's a bit incestuous, that too much power is in the one household.\" But he said there was no conflict of interest. \"In the constitution of the SNP, the oversight of the administrative side of the party lies with the business convener, not with the leader. So I'm comfortable there are no issues that arise.\"\n",

      "People are scared to leave their homes because of out of control feral pigs in the Scottish Highlands, LBC's been told.\n",
      "Some of the animals have reportedly grown to the size of small ponies and started tormenting landowners near Loch Ness. Local farmers believe they're the offspring of boar which escaped from estates in the area several years ago. They claim thousands are now roaming free and living in woodland along the Great Glen. Catherine Mclennan - who stays near Drumnadrochit - told LBC: \"In this area of the Glen we're looking at thousands of boar. \"Over the last two years we've had nothing but the ground getting dug up. A lot of the winter grazing has been absolutely ruined. It's soul destroying because it all turns into mud. \"Some of the pigs are about the same size as a small pony. Some have gone up to 32 stone. \"I lost two small lambs to them. They were torn to shreds. My friend's whole garden has been dug up by the boar and even his wife won't leave the house. \"A poor lady that was walking her dog, she was surrounded by wild boar. And she thought 'do I just run for it?'. She did, but now that poor lassie doesn't really want to leave her house and everything else. \"It's ridiculous that people can't leave their houses and not be thinking what's going to jump out behind me and attack me. They are out of control. I think the wild boar need to be licensed and there needs to be compensation for farmers that are losing livestock and wild grazing\". Fergus also stays along the Great Glen where he farms sheep. He doesn't think the pigs will be able to breach his fencing but warns it would be dangerous if they did. \"They are omnivores, they eat everything and the numbers are amazing, if you go down to the Forest of Dean they're into the thousands. \"They can weigh 80, 90, 100kgs. They can do 20mph cross country, they are big. \"They've also got a very large set of teeth at the front and when they attack they will go for your legs and get the femoral artery, and you will bleed to death very quickly. \"So the people who are actually shooting boar, some of them are wearing forestry trousers because they have the protection\".

They get their nose under the turf and roll it up and you end up with these sort of grass sandwiches. \"It worries you because they go through the ancient woodland and reduce the biodiversity. They will take out tubes and roots of plants that don't spread very well, some of the rare beetles as well. \"I think they do have a place here - but in very low numbers.\" Bobby Sanderson's a local deer manager with Highland Deer Management and game dealer He's now also being called in by landowners to manage the feral pigs which he agrees are \"out of control\". \"They're large hairy pigs with big sharp tusks. We have an average for females of about 70kg and males about 90kg, but there's quite a lot that are way over that. \"They're all along the Great Glen from Invergarry up to Drumnadrochit on the north side. Although there a few that have made it all the way to Inverness and have disappeared again since then. \"I take at least 50 to 60 myself and that's only selective management on a few pockets of ground. \"They're so widespread it would take a concerted effort of lots of people to even get them back to controllable numbers.\" A NatureScot spokesperson said: \"In recent decades, breeding populations of non-native feral pigs have become established in Scotland as a result of escapes or illegal releases. “In Scotland, there are at least four separate breeding populations of feral pigs, located in Lochaber, Dumfries and Galloway, and Ross-shire. \"We estimate the total population in Scotland may have reached the low thousands. “In Scotland, the primary responsibility for controlling feral pigs lies with individual land managers.\"\n",

      "The UK's first drug consumption facility for taking heroin has been delayed due to issues with the water supply.\n",
      "The opening of the facility, located in Glasgow, has been pushed back so authorities can check that the tap water is safe. It was due to open to drug users on October 21, allowing them to take heroin under medical supervision. The date has now been pushed back to the end of the year or even the start of 2025 after the facility failed to pass a three-stage water testing programme. Cllr Allan Casey, who is the convener for addiction services at Glasgow city council, said staff were \"ready to go\" but \"red tape\" around the water supply was holding up the opening. The council will not \"cut corners\" to get it opened quicker, he said. The Safer Drugs Consumption facility will accommodate up to 30 drug users at a time. They will be able to consume illegal drugs with the supervision of clinical staff every day of the year between 9am and 9pm.

It comes in a bid to tackle an increasing number of deaths connected to drugs. Scotland is the drugs death capital of Europe, having seen the number of fatalities soar by 12 per cent last year. The death rate in Scotland is almost triple that of the next worst country and almost double the rate in Wales. Scotland’s chief law officer Lord Advocate Dorothy Bain told police that it would \"not be in the public interest\" to take action against people using the facility. If it is deemed a success, it has been suggested that more could open across Scotland. However, the previous Tory government refused to back the proposal.\n",

      "Edinburgh council leader Cammy Day has quit amid allegations of inappropriate messages.\n",
      "Mr Day allegedly \"bombarded\" Ukrainian refugees with messages, which were said to have included sexually explicit questions. Two refugees, who came to Scotland in 2022 to flee the war in Ukraine, told the Sunday Mail that they were messaged by Mr Day on social media and dating sites. One of them claimed that he also asked to meet for wine and they felt pressure to reply due to his power in parliament.

In a statement, he said: \"The recent commentary on my personal life is detracting from the important work this Labour-led council does for the people of Edinburgh. \"It undermines the dedicated efforts of my colleagues and council officers. \"That's why it's time for me to step aside as leader.\" He continued: \"I am hugely proud of what we've achieved for the capital during my time as leader and truly believe that Edinburgh is a better, fairer city as a result. \"I'm also proud to have led a way of successfully doing politics across divides, finding a way to deliver on our priorities for our people and our city. \"I love Edinburgh and it has been an enormous privilege to have played a part in its success.\" A complaint was filed on October 22 with Scottish Police investigating the claims. They have confirmed that no criminality had been established. The City of Edinburgh council said it dealt with complaints through \"established processes\".  After speaking with a whistleblowing organisation, the Scottish Police, SNP, Conservative and Liberal Democrat councillors decided collectively that Mr Day was to step down as leader. Mr Day previously worked in community development and turned to politics in his 30s. He became a councillor in 2008 and has led a minority Labour administration since 2022.

He said as soon as the party learned of these claims they promptly suspended Mr Day. A Scottish Labour spokesperson said the party took all complaints seriously and that they are investigating in line with party policy.  First Minister John Swinney also expressed his concerns about the allegations, saying any complaints should be investigated \"fully and comprehensively\".  The Ukrainian consulate in Edinburgh has said it \"looks forward to the results of the investigation and expresses hope for a fair resolution of this case\". Edinburgh Council parties are now preparing for the next leader before a full council meeting scheduled for next Thursday.\n",

      "Immigration remains a reserved matter for Westminster, but the Scottish government is looking at routes to increase migration north of the border. “Obviously I would prefer it if immigration was devolved to Scotland but, in the meantime, I have had initial very positive meetings with the new equivalent ministers in the UK government,” Kaukab Stewart said. “I am asking for sort of, like, I suppose a rural visa but also a more Scottish sort of, like, bespoke visa so that we can match the jobs that we require in Scotland and attract those particular people.  “That is ongoing work with the UK government and it is very positive at the moment.” Ukraine 'fires US missiles into Russia for first time' as Putin relaxes rules around nuclear weapon use Jeremy Clarkson tells government to 'back down' over inheritance tax changes at farmer's protest Just last month, the Home Office ruled out a specific immigration route for Scotland, telling the BBC: “We are not at all considering a Scottish visa system.\" Ms Stewart made the claims as she announced the expansion of Scotland’s Migration Service which offers information and advice for people and employers to navigate the immigration system. The Equalities Minister cited population decline and a skills gap as reasons why the Migration Service and a bespoke Scottish visa are necessary. “Supporting migration also has significant potential boost our economy,” she said. “For example, attracting 1,000 higher rate taxpayers each year for five years could add £98 million to the Scottish Budget.” The first phase of the service started earlier this year, with more than 150 free appointments provided by Citizens Advice Scotland and immigration law firm Seraphus.

Ahead of the meeting, she told LBC: \"We all know where he is. \"We all know he's practicing in Libya. \"He's brazen enough to advertise his surgery. \"But, we need him back to this country so we can see Eljamel face the justice that we so desperately need to see. \"I'm hoping that Secretary of State for Scotland and the Foreign Office can leave no stone unturned for the extradition of Eljamel to bring him back to Scotland. \"There has to be a day of reckoning.\" She added some of the 200 patients affected suffer from \"chronic constant pain\" or are \"housebound\". \"Some can't even get out of their bed,\" she said. \"They are housebound and suffer with constant pain.\" She said some patients were left blind or wheelchair-bound as she branded the situation \"horrendous.\" There is a long-running police investigation into the surgeon, which has not yet led to any charges. This should not prevent the UK government from considering extradition, she continued. \"We believe there are hundreds if not thousands of people out there who felt they were just unlucky with their surgery, they have never heard of this scandal and they are unaware of the public inquiry and police investigation.\" Jules Rose will meet Scottish Secretary Ian Murray on Friday morning.\n",

      "A student housing justice group has found nearly three in five students in Scotland’s capital city are worried about where they’re going to live next year, as private rents have risen across the board.\n",
      "SLURP has exclusively shared its annual survey results with LBC, suggesting the average monthly rent in a shared private tenancy is now £690.36 for students across Edinburgh’s four universities – up 10.4% on last year. Private halls of residence have hiked rents by a massive 64% since last year, taking the average to £1,028 a month. Heriot-Watt University student Jamie has told LBC he is still staying with friends two months into the academic year because he has struggled to find a lease.

SLURP’s volunteer coordinator Noah Brown has told LBC that leaves students in an impossible position: “That private rental agreement is 85% of your student loan and the private student accommodation one… that’s 126.9% of your student loan, like, just on rent.” Mr Brown supports the idea of introducing an ‘Edinburgh adjustment’ providing a higher maintenance loan to students studying in the Scottish capital, like that offered to those who study in London. “I definitely think it would be very beneficial for almost everyone who’s getting a student loan for it to be more,” Jamie agreed. “Because then you wouldn’t just be using it on rent, you’d be able to buy yourself food as well. You’d be a lot less stressed about everything.” Currently, Jamie is considering moving out of Edinburgh to Livingston where rents are lower and travelling in for his lectures. But the reliability of public transport has given him pause. Mr Brown is urging the Scottish Government to consider students within the new Renters Reform Bill as it’s debated in Holyrood. “When a student tenant is negotiating a price with a landlord their only other option really is this really expensive private [halls] accommodation, and this allows landlords to charge a higher price because you have no other choice,” he said. “I don’t want people to view student housing interests as conflicting with the community because, like, we are members of the community and unregulated purpose-built student accommodations raise the rent for everyone.” In the same survey, 11.8% of respondents said they are ‘very worried’ about where they will live next year, with 47.4% saying they are ‘slightly worried’.\n",

He said that if elected he plans to remain the MP for Aberdeen South until the next general election but would not take two salaries.

I don't want to sit out the upcoming battles that our city, shire and country face in Holyrood.\" He added: \"In my mind, it is clear that we are at a crucial junction in our nation's story. \"As John Swinney rebuilds the SNP and refocuses his government, I feel that I can contribute towards the next chapter and help build the case for independence. \"And, in doing so, I'll aim to be as unashamed as always in putting Aberdeen and Scotland first.\" The deadline for applications to be considered for selection as an SNP candidate for the Holyrood 2026 election closed on Monday. Mr Flynn told the Press and Journal it \"didn't fill him with any great delight\" to go up against sitting MSP Audrey Nicoll for selection to the constituency. Ahead of the 2021 Holyrood elections, the SNP changed internal rules to require MPs to resign their seat at Westminster to fight for selection to Holyrood. This led to then-MP Joanna Cherry pulling out of the selection contest for the Edinburgh Central seat, and at the time she said the rule change \"hobbled\" her in her Holyrood selection bid. Mr Flynn told the Press and Journal he believes party rules are \"election-specific\". He wrote: \"I will not take a second parliamentary income. This is personal for me, it's about Scotland's future, and that is much more valuable than any salary on offer. \"Nevertheless, I'm not blind to the fact that I will have to box smarter and work even harder. Others have done it in the past, not least Alex Salmond and John Swinney, and I'm positive about the prospect of walking the path they previously trod. \"Finally, I also hope not to be alone on a potential path to Holyrood. Some of my current and former colleagues in Westminster, as well as many outwith the world of politics, will hopefully be aiming for elected office in Edinburgh. And that can only be a good thing.\"\n",

      "Large groups of youths have launched missiles at riot police stationed in the Gilmerton and Sighthill areas of the city, adding to escalating incidents of anti-social behaviour. Scottish Secretary and Edinburgh South MP, Ian Murray, condemned the disturbances in Gilmerton as \"disgraceful and unacceptable,\" emphasising that stricter controls on firework sales may be necessary. \"We must stop the sale of fireworks to those who wish to use this time of year to cause havoc on our streets,\" he said. Following “intelligence” suggesting plans for unrest and firework-related crime, Police Scotland granted officers stop-and-search powers across Gracemount, Moredun, and Niddrie.  This means officers can search individuals and vehicles for weapons and other “dangerous instruments” if there is a risk of serious violence or disorder.

In response to escalating disturbances, Lothian Buses withdrew all services from the Niddrie area for the night, citing a “difficult but necessary decision” to ensure safety. \"The safety and wellbeing of our colleagues and customers is our absolute priority,\" the company noted in a social media statement, reiterating a \"zero-tolerance approach to all instances of antisocial behaviour.\" Niddrie had also seen unrest on 31 October, with reports of fireworks and bricks being thrown at both police and public transport vehicles. Meanwhile, in Glasgow, officers seized a \"significant quantity\" of fireworks from a van in Drumpchapel, which they said were being \"sold to the general public, including children.\" A report will be submitted to the Procurator Fiscal, and Trading Standards have been alerted. Scotland’s first fireworks control zones (FCZs) are in effect across parts of Edinburgh and Glasgow from 1 to 10 November, prohibiting the use of fireworks within these designated areas. Violations carry potential penalties of up to £5,000 in fines, six months in prison, or both.\n",

      "Halloween partygoers were left horrified in the Scottish capital after the elderly man in the “tragic incident” on Saturday evening. Officers were called to the incident in the Cowgate area of the city around 7.25pm on Saturday night. A number of roads in the area were closed to allow officers to carry out their investigation. The roads have since re-opened. In one video shared online, Halloween revellers are seen reacting to the gruesome sight, with one onlooker saying they initially believed it be a prank. Read more: 'Horror' in Edinburgh as 'severed head' found on Cowgate city street, with 'gruesome images' circulating online “The Cowgate is usually mobbed on a Saturday night but the bars and pubs inside the police cordon were all closed by 8pm,” one local told the MailOnline. “When some people heard what had been found on the road they thought it was a Halloween prank. “That all changed when they saw the large numbers of police and the forensic tents being put up.” Speaking after the tragic incident, Chief Inspector Trisha Clark, the local area commander, said: “We are aware of videos and images circulating on social media which are causing distress to the deceased's family and those viewing them inadvertently. \"We would ask members of the public not to share them out of respect for his family, and to report them to the relevant social media platform to prevent further circulation. “There has been a lot of speculation, and I would like to reassure the local community that this was an isolated incident and there is no risk to the wider public. “This was a tragic incident. We are investigating a crash, and our road policing officers, assisted by local officers, are continuing to carry out enquiries.” Sergeant Louise Birrell, Road Policing Unit, Edinburgh: “Our thoughts are with the family and friends of the man who died. “Extensive enquiries are ongoing to establish the full circumstances of this incident. “Officers have spoken to a number of people who were in the area at the time and work is ongoing to check public and private CCTV footage. “We are still keen to hear from anyone who has not yet spoken to police. If you have any information about what happened, then please get in touch.“ It comes after the owner of an Edinburgh nightclub has shut down sick social media rumours that he was the victim of the fatal incident. John \"Mick\" Williams, the owner of Edinburgh's Liquid Rooms, shared a video on social media of him quashing the rumours and telling trolls: \"Still alive.\" Addressing the claims he was the victim of the incident, Mr McWilliams said: \"Good morning everyone, it's 11.45am and yes, I am still alive. My condolences go out to whoever did die in the Grassmarket last night. \"I can assure you I am alive and kicking. He continued: \"Social media, such a dangerous thing. This has upset so many people.\"\n",

The news has prompted fresh safety concerns over the jabs and whether they should still be prescribed. The data shows 22 people died after using the medicine for weight loss - while another 60 fatalities were linked to its use in treating type 2 diabetes.  Back in December, a stark warning was issued to Brits attempting to get their hands on weight loss drugs as officials spoke of the \"tremendous\" dangers of black market weight loss drugs. Andy Morling, deputy head of enforcement at the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency (MHRA), which is responsible for overseeing the sale of drugs in the UK, said people have suffered “tremendous harm” as a result of taking counterfeit goods bought on the black market - and confessed the problem “keeps [him] awake a night.” It comes after the National Pharmacy Association (NPA) suggested there could be an \"explosion in the unlicensed sale of medication online\" because of a shortage of the Diabetes medication Ozempic. Speaking to LBC, Mr Morling said: “These are things that have probably been put together in their bedrooms by mixing various powders that they’ve purchased on the internet themselves, they’ve put it into syringes which are in no way sterile. “My advice is you cannot buy weight loss medicines on social media, on websites or in a beauty salon without a prescription.” The MHRA figures show that 18 deaths were explicitly linked to Mounjaro, while 29 occurred following the use of Ozempic, Rybelsus, or Wegovy, all of which contain the active ingredient semaglutide. Another 35 fatalities were associated with Saxenda and Victoza, which contain liraglutide, The Sun reported.

      "A woman is suing an IVF clinic in the US after she gave birth to a baby boy that wasn't hers, and she had to give it up. \n",
      "Krystena Murray, 38, is suing an IVF clinic in Savannah, Georgia after giving birth to a baby that wasn't hers, and having it taken away from her. She described it as \"the scariest moment of her life\" when she realised she was implanted with the wrong embryo, according to the lawsuit. Murray gave birth in December 2023, through IVF treatment at The Coastal Fertility Specialists. The lawsuit alleged that she \"unknowingly and unwillingly carried a child through pregnancy who was not biologically related to her.\" She said that she was shocked her baby was African American, because she had chosen a white sperm donor.  Her lawsuit said that she had to give custody of the baby to the biological parents, only five months later, which \"added to her trauma\".

But it was also the scariest moment of my life,” she said at a news conference.  “All of the love and joy I felt seeing him for the first time was immediately replaced by fear. How could this have happened?” The lawsuit said Murray \"hoped that it was just a sperm mix-up, not an embryo mix-up.”  However, tests showed that the baby was not biologically related to her at all. Murray told NBC news, after handing over the custody of the child: “I walked in a mum with a child and a baby who loved me and was mine and was attached to me, and I walked out of the building with an empty stroller, and they left with my son.” “I grew him, I raised him, I loved him. I saw him no different than if he were mine, my own genetic embryo.  \"To carry a baby, fall in love with him, deliver him, and build the uniquely special bond between mother and baby, all to have him taken away. \"I'll never fully recover from this,\" she said. The Coastal Fertility Specialists said in a statement, on behalf of the clinic, it \"deeply regrets the distress caused by an unprecedented error that resulted in an embryo transfer mix-up.\" \"This was an isolated event with no further patients affected. The same day this error was discovered we immediately conducted an in-depth review and put additional safeguards in place to further protect patients and to ensure that such an incident does not happen again.\" Krystena Murray has accused the clinic of negligence and is seeking damages.\n",

      "Hundreds of thousands of people in the UK will be able to access urgent dental care as the NHS announces more urgent dental appointments.  NHS Dentistry was near crisis, as 1 in 4 patients who tried to see a dentist in the past two years were unable to do so. Stephen Kinnock, Minister of State for Care said: “NHS dentistry has been left broken after years of neglect , with patients left in pain without appointments, or queueing around the block just to be seen.\" 700,000 appointments will be available, across the country, from April. These appointments will target 'dental deserts', where patients are unable to get appointments from NHS patients.  They will be allocated appointments for patients who are in pain - including tooth infections or needing urgent repairs to a bridge.

Kinnock continued: “We promised we would end the misery faced by hundreds of thousands of people unable to get urgent dental care. Today we’re starting to deliver on that commitment.\" Jacob Lant, Chief Executive of National Voices, said: “NHS dentistry has been left in a sorry state, with far too many people experiencing pain and discomfort because they can’t access basic care.\" “These extra urgent appointments will be welcome and are a helpful first step, but fixing the nation’s oral health crisis will require a sustained effort.\" The nation is also facing a children's oral health crisis, with tooth decay being the number one reason children aged five-nine are admitted to hospital. More than a fifth of five-year-olds have signs of dental decay, according today from the Office for Health Improvement and Disparities.\n",

      "Doctors who change gender are having their medical records scrubbed, the General Medical Council (GMC) has admitted. \n",
      "The GMC - the body which regulates doctors - has admitted that doctors changing gender are handed a brand new registration number, meaning past histories of incidents, concerns or wrongdoing are no longer visible on their new record. The move amounts to effectively scrubbing the public disciplinary history of trans doctors who change gender. Following the discovery, Health Secretary Wes Streeting was seen to condemn the wiping of doctors’ records, labelling the practice \"extremely concerning\". The Health Secretary has also called for an urgent overhaul of the practice. The issue follows the case of Sandie Peggie, an NHS nurse suspended for objecting to a transgender doctor Dr Beth Upton using female changing rooms.  The alarming oversight came to light after a retired anaesthetist contacted The Telegraph to flag concerns that the doctor had been given a new registration number to the paper.

The GMC confirmed that Dr Upton was among 62 doctors to have been handed new registration numbers under the body's current policy. In essence, the move means that future patients would be unable to see any historic record details relating their doctor if searched on the GMC’s publicly available online database. The GMC, which holds a public register of all doctors, permits patients and the wider public to check whether a medic has been subject to previous suspensions or has been struck off. The Health Secretary added the situation should “not have been allowed”. Speaking with the Telegraph following the claims, he said: “This is extremely concerning, and should not have been allowed to happen. “It is completely within the power of the GMC to find a workaround for this that means transparency for patients, as well as protections in the Equality Act, are preserved.  \"I expect them to make reassurances that they will address this.”\n",

      "Hospitals are continuing to \"run at near capacity\", officials warned, with almost one in seven beds occupied by people who are medically fit to be discharged. Weekly data published by NHS England shows an average of 1,160 hospital beds were filled each day last week by patients with diarrhoea and vomiting or norovirus-like symptoms, up 22% from 948 the previous week.  Norovirus levels also remain higher than at this point 12 months ago, when an average of 509 beds were filled with patients with symptoms, and also two years ago (629 patients).  Norovirus is a stomach bug that causes vomiting and diarrhoea.

Professor Sir Stephen Powis, national medical director of NHS England, said: \"It is concerning to see the number of patients with norovirus hit an all-time high and there is no let up for hospital staff who are working tirelessly to treat more than a thousand patients each day with the horrible bug, on top of other winter viruses.\" Amy Douglas, lead epidemiologist at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), added: \"Norovirus cases are still exceptionally high and continue to rise, though we are hopeful that the school half-term provides a break. \"It remains important to take steps to avoid passing on the infection.\" Ms Douglas stressed that alcohol gels do not kill norovirus and hands should be washed with warm soapy water to stop the spread of infection. She also advised for surfaces to be cleaned with bleach-based products. Elsewhere, figures show an average of 13,767 hospital beds per day were filled last week with patients who were fit to be discharged. This is down from 14,087 the previous week, which was the highest number so far this winter. On average, 41% of patients ready to leave hospital last week were actually discharged each day. Sir Stephen added: \"Hospitals continue to run at near capacity, with added pressure from almost one in seven beds taken up by patients who don't need to be in hospital, and as these pressures continue it is vital that the public continue to use 999 and A&E in life-threatening emergencies and use NHS 111 - and 111 online - if you need advice and support for other conditions.\" Some 29.1% of patients arriving by ambulance at hospitals last week waited at least 30 minutes to be handed over to A&E teams, up from 27.9% in the previous week. The figure stood as high as 42.2% at the start of the year. Some 9.6% of ambulance handovers last week were delayed by more than an hour, up week-on-week from 9.1%, but well below the peak of 21.3% in early January. Health Secretary Wes Streeting added: \"Today's data shows the NHS is continuing to grapple with winter pressures across the country and I want to thank all the NHS staff working tirelessly in difficult conditions. \"We have taken action to support the NHS this winter, including delivering millions of vaccinations for people up and down the country, rolling out the RSV vaccine for the first time and ending the resident doctor strikes so that staff are on the front line, not the picket line for the first winter in three years. \"It will take time, but through our Plan for Change, we will get the NHS back on its feet.\" Reacting to the figures, Saffron Cordery, interim chief executive at NHS Providers, said: \"Winter has seen very high demand right across hospital, mental health, community and ambulance services but trust leaders and staff continue to do everything they can to see patients as quickly as possible in the face of extreme pressure and challenges.\" Rory Deighton, acute director at the NHS Confederation, also said it is \"concerning\" delayed discharge figures are persisting. \"Beds are also full to the brim, as we continue to hear from members about the pressure on social care funding, a lack of care home beds and delays to discharge packages slowing the flow of patients through hospitals,\" he added. \"Combined with ambulance handover delays, these challenges can lead to longer hospital stays which are not best for patients and increase pressure on healthcare resources.\" Meanwhile, flu levels in hospitals in England have fallen for the sixth week in a row. An average of 1,755 flu patients were in beds each day last week, including 87 in critical care. This is down 14% from 2,039 the previous week, when 96 were in critical care. The total is slightly lower than at this point last winter (2,208) but higher than at this stage two years ago (638).\n",

      "\n",
      "Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust pleaded guilty at Nottingham Magistrates' Court on Monday to six counts of failing to provide safe care and treatment in relation to the deaths. Adele O'Sullivan was 26 minutes old when she died on April 7 2021, Kahlani Rawson died aged four days old on June 15 2021, and Quinn Parker was one day old when he died on July 16 2021.\t The court was also told that \"serious and systemic failures\" exposed all three mothers, Daniela O'Sullivan, Ellise Rawson and Emmie Studencki, and their babies to significant risk of harm.  \t District Judge Grace Leong told the hearing that the \"catalogue of failures\" in the trust's maternity unit were \"avoidable and should never have happened\".  \t Family members cried in the courtroom as District Judge Leong expressed her \"deepest sympathy\" to each of them and said the trust they put in NUH to deliver their babies safely had been broken.  \t She said: \"Daniela and Adam O'Sullivan, Ellise Rawson and her grandmother Amy, and Emmie Studencki and Ryan Parker placed their trust in the system that was supposed to protect expectant mothers and keep babies safe, and that trust was broken.  \t \"The death of a child is a tragedy beyond words, and where that loss is avoidable the pain is even more profound.  \t \"Three-and-a-half years have gone by, yet for the families no doubt their grief remains as raw as ever and a constant presence in their lives that is woven into every moment.  \t Read more: 'I'll f*****g kill you': Mum who dragged rival parent to ground and repeatedly kicked her outside school avoids jail Read more: Made in Chelsea star has jewellery, camera and clothes stolen as she falls victim to London ‘paint scam’ \"The grief of a baby is not just about the past, it is about the future that is stolen.  \t \"It is a lifetime of missing first words, first steps, first days of school, missing memories that should have been made.  \t \"It is very difficult, if not impossible, to move on from the failures of the trust and its maternity unit.  \t \"The weight of what should have been done different will linger indefinitely.\"  \t District Judge Leong highlighted \"critical failures\" in care as she said the purpose of the sentencing hearing, in which she was limited to imposing a fine, was to \"ensure the trust responsible is held to account and meaningful steps are taken to prevent such failures in the care of mothers and their babies, while recognising the harm caused\".  \t NUH, which is currently at the centre of the largest maternity inquiry in the history of the NHS, is the first trust to be prosecuted by healthcare watchdog the Care Quality Commission (CQC) more than once after it was earlier fined £800,000 in 2023 for failures in the care of Wynter Andrews, who died 23 minutes after being born at the Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham in September 2019.  \t The CQC says the trust did not ensure safe care and treatment due to a lack of adequate systems and processes being in place or not being appropriately implemented to ensure staff managed all risks to mothers and babies' health and wellbeing.  \t District Judge Leong highlighted concerns over a lack of escalation of care, an inadequate communications system and a failure to provide \"clear and complete\" information sharing.  \t She said: \"I accept there were systems in place but there were so many procedures where guidance was not followed or adhered to.  \t \"The failures in combination amounted to systematic failures in the provision of care and treatment.\"  \t The trust has an average turnover of £612 million, but District Judge Leong said she was \"acutely aware\" that all its funds as a publicly funded body were accounted for and that the trust is currently operating at a deficit of around £100 million.  \t She said: \"I can't ignore the negative impact this will have... but the significant financial penalty has to be fixed to mark the gravity of these offences and hold the trust to account for their failings.\"  \t The £1.6 million fine was broken down into £700,000 for the death of Quinn Parker, £300,000 each for the deaths of Adele O'Sullivan and Kahlani Rawson and £100,000 each for the mothers.  \t The trust was also ordered to pay prosecution costs of more than £67,000 as well as a surcharge of £190.\n",

      "\n",
      "Official data shows as many as six in 10 children in some areas have rotting teeth by the age of five, with clear differences between poorer regions of England and the more affluent. At a regional level, Manchester has the highest percentage of five-year-olds with enamel and/or dentinal decay, with 60.8 per cent of children affected there in 2024.

Rochford in Essex had the lowest percentage (4.9 per cent), followed by St Albans (6.0 per cent), North Hertfordshire (6.9 per cent) and Bromsgrove (8.0 per cent). The figures relate to five-year-olds with any enamel and/or dentinal decay and show that 37.0% of children in the most deprived areas are affected - more than double the 18.0% for the least deprived areas. The data shows a clear North-South divide, with the three highest percentages (not including London) all in northern England. While England as a whole has seen a drop in the percentage of children with enamel and/or dentinal decay - from 29.3 per cent in 2022 to 26.9 per cent in 2024 - it has risen in the North East, from 26.0 per cent  to 27.7 per cent. In the South West, the percentage has jumped from 23.3% to 24.2 per cent, and from 28.5 per cent in London to 30.0 per cent. One of the main causes of enamel erosion is acids found in food and drink. The report said: \"It is especially important to determine the proportion of children with enamel decay who do not yet have dentinal decay, as in the past, children were often regarded as 'free of decay'.\" For dentinal decay alone (excluding enamel decay), some 23.7 per cent of children in 2022 in England were affected, dropping slightly to 22.4 per cent in 2024. The British Dental Association (BDA) said there has been \"no progress\" on the rollout of Labour manifesto pledges to \"fix the failed contract fuelling the crisis in NHS dentistry\" or to deliver prevention programmes in schools. Chairman Eddie Crouch, said: \"This oral health gap was made in Westminster, with children paying the price for official failure to take dentistry seriously. \"A new Government calls this 'Dickensian', but it will take deeds not words to turn this around.\" Liberal Democrat health spokesperson Helen Morgan said: \"The Labour government's promised 700,000 additional dental appointments have so far proven as real as the Loch Ness monster. \"To see your child in pain is one of the worst feelings a parent can go through. \"But to think that so much of this suffering could be prevented if the scourge of dental deserts was ended makes it all the more infuriating that we are still in this situation. \"It is time ministers woke up, gripped this crisis and prevented more unnecessary suffering.\" The Royal College of Surgeons said, in 2022/23, some 47,581 children required tooth extractions in NHS hospitals, with 66 per cent (31,165 cases) directly attributed to decay. This is the equivalent of 120 hospital operations every working day, it said. Dr Charlotte Eckhardt, dean of the faculty of dental surgery at the Royal College of Surgeons, said: \"We've seen a slight improvement overall in the number of five-year-olds with tooth decay, but it is still too high. \"The fact that more than one in five children still suffer from an entirely preventable condition is concerning. \"Supervised toothbrushing programmes (STPs), which the Government has said it will implement, offer a glimmer of hope, but their roll-out is uneven across the country. \"STPs have proven to reduce dental decay within a single year after children have been enrolled.\"\n",

      "LBC has uncovered black market botox being routinely injected on UK high streets - with experts warning it’s creating “a threat to public health”.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Only six prescription-only botox brands are legal for cosmetic use in the UK, but LBC has learned of companies illegally selling banned botulinum toxins through social media and websites masquerading as legitimate medical suppliers.  Councils across the country - including Manchester, Wolverhampton and Nottinghamshire - are warning about products such as an Innotox, manufactured in South Korea by Medytox, as well as Botulax and RenTox. None of these products are authorised for use in the UK. There are concerns black market sales are being fueled by the viral K-Beauty trend, with Korean skincare and cosmetic procedures like 'glass skin facials' surging in popularity.  These banned botox products are often found in salons, environmental health officers have told LBC.  They say aestheticians are purchasing them through social media.   The government's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency say botox from unregulated sellers is often substandard or fake and \"represents both a threat to public health and an increased risk of harm to individuals.\"  The consequences of being injected with counterfeit toxins can be life threatening.   Marcelle King was given fake botox by a man pretending to be a doctor.  She suffered a huge anaphylactic shock to the substance, which tests showed was unrefined beef gelatine imported from China.  \"He started these injections... each one felt like a red hot cigarette,\" Marcelle told LBC.  \"My (face) was swelling up like Frankenstein's Monster and my eyes started blistering up. I was really wheezing and struggling to breathe.\"   Read more: Grenfell Tower will be demolished, government confirms Read more: British couple found dead in French villa named as fears former organised crime financial investigator was 'murdered' Marcelle was hospitalised and, eventually, the man who gave her the injections was jailed.  Eleven years on, she still lives with constant pain and the effects of nerve damage caused by the incident.  Plastic surgeon Dalvi Humza, from the Joint Council for Cosmetic Practitioners, told LBC the demand for blackmarket botox is driven by cost.  He believes this is exacerbating the problem in the UK: \"The going rate for a toxin when buying through the regulatory body is quite high, around £100. I could get one of these [unregulated products] for £10.\" Mr Humza is urging anyone having an aesthetic procedure to check exactly what they are being injected with, and identify whether it is a UK-registered product.   The MHRA says anyone who suspects a product is fake or unregulated should report it directly to them, through their Yellow Card scheme.\n",

      "The number of deaths across the UK specifically caused by alcohol has reached a record high, according to new figures.\n",
      "It is the fourth consecutive year a new record has been reported by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Some 10,473 deaths from alcohol-specific causes were registered in the UK in 2023, up from 10,048 in 2022. While the number deaths increased, the rate fell slightly to 15.9 deaths per 100,000 people from 16.6 per 100,000 a year earlier. Read More: Alcohol prices rising as higher tax and duties take effect Read More: Shocking moment TV boss is restrained for hurling drink and wig at flight attendant after being refused alcohol The rate of deaths in males (21.9 per 100,000) remained around double that in females (10.3 per 100,000) in 2023. Age-specific death rates fell for the first time since 2020 for people between the ages of 25 and 59, the ONS said. Death rates for those aged 20 to 24 and over 60 remained the similar to 2022. In England and Wales, death rates increased between 2022 and 2023 to 15.0 and 17.7 per 100,000 people. The English region with the highest rate - 25.7 deaths per 100,000 - was the North East, while the East Midlands was the lowest at 11.5 deaths per 100,000. Clare Taylor, chief operating officer at Turning Point, warned the \"continued high level of alcohol deaths is a public health crisis\". \"Alcohol related deaths are preventable, and access to treatment remains the key protective factor,\" she added. \"While numbers in treatment have increased significantly, too many are not getting the support they need early enough and there is still a great deal of stigma associated with alcohol problems. \"Preventing alcohol harm needs to be a national policy priority. \"We need better education and training for healthcare professionals working in GP surgeries, A&E departments and on hospital wards, and better joint working with community drug and alcohol services.\" Commenting on the figures, Pamela Healy, chief executive of the British Liver Trust, said: \"Unfortunately these figures aren't surprising. \"We are living in the shadow of harmful and hazardous drinking that is only increasing since the pandemic, and these latest figures highlight the terrifying scale of this growing health crisis.\" Dr Katherine Severi, chief executive of the Institute of Alcohol Studies, said: \"We've seen record-high deaths from alcohol in the UK every single year since the pandemic. \"This simply cannot become the new normal, so the Government must make tackling alcohol harm a top priority in 2025.\" Scotland and Northern Ireland continued to have the highest death rate, the ONS said. While Scotland's death rate remained stable in 2023, the rate in Northern Ireland decreased to 18.5 per 100,000 people. Laura Mahon, deputy chief executive of Alcohol Focus Scotland, said the figures demonstrate \"that Scotland and the rest of the UK is firmly in the grip of an alcohol health emergency\". \"The truth is that a majority of these deaths, mostly caused by liver disease, come as a result of people drinking heavily over the course of many years - with one in five Scots drinking at a level which could be harmful to their health, including increasing their risk of liver disease and cancer,\" she added. \"Unfortunately, the Covid pandemic exacerbated drinking patterns and we saw those who were already drinking heavily increase their consumption. \"The industry seeks to keep people in the dark about the health harms of alcohol by failing to provide us with the clear information we need to be able to make informed choices about our health.\"\n",

      "The clip featured a number of celebrities, scientists and charity workers, who all shared heartfelt messages to those affected by cancer. Sharing it on Instagram, the royal family said: \"This World Cancer Day, we are sending love to all those navigating a cancer diagnosis – as well as the incredible doctors, nurses, charities and families who work tirelessly to support them.\" It comes almost a year on from when both the King and Princess Kate announced that they had been diagnosed with cancer. The pair were forced to temporarily step back from public duties while they received treatment but have since returned to work.

She was diagnosed in May 2023 and went through chemotherapy as well as having a mastectomy. Meanwhile, cycling legend Sir Chris Hoy revealed in October last year that his cancer was terminal and that he had two to four years left to live. He said in the clip: \"We're all in this together, you are not alone.  \"Keep living life every single day and keep smiling, and don't forget to enjoy the here and the now.\" Olympic diver Tom Daley and presenter Adele Roberts also filmed segments for the video. Roberts said: \"Don't be afraid to ask for help, and, if you can, do something every day that makes you truly happy.  \t\"When I was diagnosed with bowel cancer, it was overwhelming.  \t \"I knew I couldn't control what it did to my body, but I was determined not to let it affect my spirit. You've got this. Lots of love.\" Daley said: \"Today on World Cancer Day I would just like to say a huge thank you to all the nurses, doctors, scientists and researchers that are continuously trying to find a cure for cancer.  \"My Dad passed away in 2011, but I want to say that whether you know someone or whether you've been recently diagnosed, we are all in this together and whatever you can do to smile every day is important.\" The royals did not make an appearance in the video, but Kate did release a photograph of herself on Monday to mark the occasion. She was snapped outdoors by her son, Prince Louis, on a wintry day and shown with her arms out-stretched in the middle of a woodland area.  \t The image was posted alongside a personal message from Kate which read: \"Don't forget to nurture all that which lies beyond the disease.\"\n",

      "LBC can reveal the Advertising Standards Authority issued a warning to a weight loss treatment provider over an advert which appeared to imply its services were backed by NHS workers.\n",
      "The ad which read ‘There’s a reason NHS workers choose Juniper to lose weight,’ has been slammed by one campaigner who shared the evidence with us. It is prohibited to advertise prescription-only medicines in the UK, and it is against both NHS and watchdog rules for NHS staff to endorse medicines. Georgie Aldous, a social media influencer who campaigns for tighter restrictions on weight loss jabs following a health scare while taking Mounjaro, said he was shocked when he came across the advert online. Read more: Warning over online sales of weight loss drugs amid fears over patient safety Read more: NHS launches landmark AI trial to detect breast cancer earlier and cut waiting lists Georgie told LBC: “When an NHS worker died from an injection how can you be allowed to say that NHS workers are using it? “The sponsored stuff is glamorizing it too much because it should be seen as a serious medical treatment.” A report said Mounjaro was linked to the death of 58-year-old NHS nurse Susan McGowan, after she took two doses of tirzepatide in the two weeks before she died on September 4, 2024. An Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) spokesperson said: “We have received complaints about [the Juniper advert] and have subsequently issued an Advice Notice to the advertiser. “This signposts potential problems under our rules and provides them with an opportunity to review their advertising so that they are confident they are compliant. “Alongside the issue of the ad potentially promoting a prescription-only medicine to the public (prohibited by our law and the rules), the broader concerns we had in this case were the potential misleadingness of the ad to imply NHS workers ‘choose Juniper’ and that the ad ran contrary to the rules that prohibit health professionals or celebrities endorsing medicines.” A spokesperson from Juniper said: “We are aware of the recent Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) advice notice regarding one of our recent ads. We take all advertising complaints very seriously, and while we work to resolve the matter with the ASA, we have removed this ad from circulation. We encourage other industry players to demonstrate the same level of cooperation. “It is also important to emphasise that Juniper’s approach to patient safety is industry-leading, and we embrace the new GPhC guidelines as we continue to add to our 18 peer-reviewed studies attesting to the rigour of our platform.” It came after the ASA issued a warning to weight-loss prescription-only medicine advertisers in December last year, and announced it was using its AI-based Active Ad Monitoring system to track adverts for GLP-1 medications and flag any that flouted the rules. Despite the warnings, the watchdog said it was continuing to catch rule-breaking paid-for online adverts, as well as social media promotions and influencer endorsements. Meanwhile, the General Pharmaceutical Council (GPhC) has made it tougher to get a hold of weight-loss jabs from online pharmacies. It will no longer be enough to require people to fill out a patient questionnaire, pharmacies must instead conduct a proper two-way consultation with the patient. The GPhC, which regulates pharmacies, said it was responding to concerns about people being prescribed the jabs when it was unsafe. The National Pharmacy Association (NPA) raised the alarm after becoming aware of people being wrongly prescribed the drugs who have previously had eating disorders, or whose body weight is already low.\n",

      "A major trial aiming to transform breast cancer screening with artificial intelligence has been launched, with almost 700,000 women expected to take part.\n",
      "It is hoped the technology will help specialists catch cancer earlier as well as freeing up radiologists in a bid to slash waiting times.  \t It comes as the Government launched a call for evidence to help shape a national cancer plan which will outline actions to transform how the disease is treated in a bid to reduce deaths.  \t Women who are already booked in for routine NHS screenings will be invited to take part in the £11 million Early Detection using Information Technology in Health (Edith) trial, which is backed by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR).  \t Some 30 testing sites across the country will be enhanced with AI technology.  \t Read more: Kate shares new image taken by Prince Louis to mark World Cancer Day Read more: Restaurant critic Giles Coren reveals prostate cancer diagnosis and says he had to 'demand' test from NHS According to Breast Cancer Now, about 55,000 women and 400 men are diagnosed with breast cancer every year in the UK.  \t Women are automatically invited for screening between the ages of 50 and 53, and then every three years until they turn 71.  \t At the appointments, x-rays known as mammograms are taken to look for cancers that are too small to see or feel.  \t At the moment, two radiologists are required to review the images from each screening to ensure accuracy.  \t However, it is hoped the AI being trialled will enable one to complete the process, freeing up radiologists to see more patients and, in turn, cut waiting lists.  \t Science and Technology Secretary Peter Kyle said: \"Catching cancer weeks earlier could be the difference between life and death - and these trials could not only help to get women faster access to treatment but reduce pressures on our NHS.\"  \t Professor Lucy Chappell, chief scientific adviser at the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) and chief executive of the NIHR, said: \"This landmark trial could lead to a significant step forward in the early detection of breast cancer, offering women faster, more accurate diagnoses when it matters most.\"  \t Dr Katharine Halliday, president of the Royal College of Radiologists, welcomed the trial, and said AI has \"immense potential\" and will play a \"vital role\" in meeting increasing demand across diagnostics, cancer care and the NHS as a whole.  \t \"Given the volume and complexity of breast screening, if AI is found to be safe and effective it could make a major impact on radiology,\" she added.  \t \"However, this is a rigorous study that will take time to yield results. With a projected 40% shortfall in consultant radiologists by 2028, the need to build radiology capacity remains urgent.\"  \t Claire Rowney, chief executive of Breast Cancer Now, said technology has the \"potential to improve breast screening\" but called for issues with the current programme to be addressed.  \t \"And, of course, any changes to the breast screening programme must be supported by robust evidence that demonstrates any new innovation or tool is safe and effective for women in the UK,\" she added.  \t The Government has also announced it will publish a national cancer plan later this year, issuing a call for evidence to experts, patients and medics to help shape the blueprint.  \t The plan will aim to transform cancer care by improving research, diagnosis, screening, treatment and prevention, and will also include specific measures for rarer forms of the disease, including those that impact children.  \t To support the focus on childhood cancers, the Government has relaunched the children and young people's cancer taskforce, which will bring together experts to help create plans to improve cancer detection and treatment in children.  \t Health Secretary Wes Streeting said: \"As a cancer survivor, I feel like one of the lucky ones.  \t \"With record numbers of people diagnosed with cancer, and Lord Darzi finding that cancer survival is worse in this country than our peers, I know that urgent action is needed to save lives and improve patient care.\"  \t Professor Peter Johnson, national clinical director for cancer at the NHS, said: \"The NHS is diagnosing more cancers at an early stage than ever before - when treatment is most likely to be effective - but we know we need to accelerate progress further.  \t \"A national cancer plan will give us the chance to do just that - bringing in new ideas, help us make best practice, normal practice - and ensure the NHS is at the cutting edge of new cancer developments and innovations in the future.\"  \t Cancer Research UK's chief executive Michelle Mitchell said: \"Nearly one in two of us will get cancer in our lifetime.  \t \"Tackling the leading cause of death in the UK requires bold leadership, and we welcome the UK Government's National Cancer Plan for England.  \t \"We need a long-term strategy focused on diagnosing cancers earlier, reducing waiting times, and bringing cutting-edge treatment to people sooner.\"  \t However, experts warned that if the forthcoming cancer plan does not succeed then patients will \"continue to needlessly die\".  \t Two leading cancer professors, Mark Lawler and Pat Price, said that while cancer survival has improved in the UK over the last 50 years, it \"still lags behind many other high-income countries\".  \t In an editorial published in the journal Lancet Oncology, they wrote: \"The real danger is a tick-box unambitious cancer plan that is set up to fail.  \t \"The UK needs to be a leader and not a lagger.  \t \"Incremental change will not be enough. We need strategies to supercharge both early diagnosis and treatment, with ambitions and accountable targets that are met.  \t \"If we do not succeed, patients in the UK will continue to needlessly die.\"  \t Meanwhile, a separate study published in the journal Lancet Respiratory Medicine suggests the proportion of never-smokers diagnosed with lung cancer could be on the rise.  \t Researchers from the International Agency for Research on Cancer looked at global lung cancer cases, by sub type of cancer.  \t They found that adenocarcinoma was the dominant subtype among both men and women in 2022.  \t Researchers said that adenocarcinoma accounts for 53%-70% of cases of lung cancer among people who have never smoked worldwide.  \t Because of this, air pollution should be considered an \"important factor\" that can partly explain the \"emerging predominance\" of this sub type of cancer, they added.\n",

      "The body of a young woman who died of a blood clot was presented for viewing in a hospital “cleaning cupboard”, her family said, after NHS staff missed “red flag” symptoms.\n",
      "Dena Collins collapsed in the home she shared with her parents in south east London on the morning of 12 January 2023, a day after attending Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Woolwich with symptoms including shortness of breath, a fever, and calf pain which was so severe she was using a crutch. Her father, Dean, tried to resuscitate her, but she was pronounced dead at the hospital’s Emergency Department just over two hours later after suffering a pulmonary embolism. She had been discharged from A&E the evening before pending a scan booked for the next day, but she was sent home without blood thinning medication despite a clot not being ruled out, a mistake her family believe cost her her life. In a Serious Incident Report into Dena’s death, seen by LBC, Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Trust concedes mistakes were made in her care. It said: “The symptoms of Deep Vein Thrombosis [DVT] that [Dena] presented with were not those typically seen in this relatively common condition, but there were, with the benefit of hindsight, some missed red flags… Had the DVT been diagnosed earlier and she received [blood thinners] her outcome may have been different.” Yesterday, after a fight for answers which has already lasted more than two years, the inquest into her death was delayed until the summer, which her family has described as “devastating.” They believe Dena’s concerns were overlooked because she presented as a healthy 28-year-old woman. They are now sharing their horrifying ordeal in the hope that other young women know how to spot the signs of a blood clot to advocate for the right care, and fight what they believe is medical misogyny. They say Dena was a “passionate” primary school teacher, a dedicated Crystal Palace fan with her nails always painted the club’s red and blue. She was training for the London Marathon, and was “effortlessly hilarious.” “She was just sparkling glitter. And you couldn't help but want to be in her presence,” Clare, her older sister, tells LBC. Dena was at the supermarket on Saturday 7 January 2023 when she felt a pain in the back of her leg. The next day her concern grew after developing sickness and diarrhea. She was on the combined contraceptive pill and had just finished a course of antibiotics, both of which she knew increased the risk of blood clots. According to the NHS, the risk of getting a blood clot as a result of using the combined pill is “very small and affects up to 1 in 1,000 people.” Concerned, Dena went to the GP on Monday morning. The doctor’s notes indicate the possibility of a blood clot was considered, but Dena was sent home with a diagnosis of “likely muscle strain.” The appointment notes were never logged on the shared NHS system. Despite being in severe pain, she went to work the next day, using a crutch to get around. The following day, Wednesday, the pain was insurmountable. Dean drove his daughter to Urgent Care at QEH. She texted Clare: “the doctor said with my breathlessness and pain in my leg I might have a blood clot from the [antibiotics] I took last weekend”. Dena was sent next door to A&E for further scans, with a handwritten note showing that a blood clot was being considered. At 11am a “D-Dimer” test, which checks for blood clotting problems, returned a score of 710, three times the normal level. Months later the Serious Incident Report would find: “The significance of a raised D-dimer was not noted and DVT [blood clot] had not been ruled out.” Dena was visited by four doctors over the course of the day. The ensuing investigation found multiple missed opportunities to identify a blood clot, including test results not being properly reviewed and notes being copy and pasted from previous observations. The most senior was a consultant who at 3pm diagnosed a likely “Baker’s Cyst”, a fluid-filled swelling that develops at the back of the knee. Dena was booked in for a scan the following day, and sent home at 6pm without blood-thinning medication often given as a precaution to patients with possible blood clots. That evening, feeling the effects of painkillers issued by the hospital, Dena told her family she was feeling better and went to bed. Her mother Irene, buoyed by that assurance, went to work as usual the following day, leaving Dean to take Dena for her scan. But just after 9am, Dean heard a loud bang upstairs. “She had collapsed coming down the stairs,” says Clare. “She said to him, I think her last words were: “I feel funny, I've never felt so bad. Something's not right.” Dean performed CPR on his daughter while waiting for the paramedics to arrive. As Irene and Clare rushed home, medics tried to resuscitate Dena on the landing, and then took her out to the street. ‘I saw her face, and I remember shouting like, oh, my God, she's dead,” says Clare. “Apparently I rang work and said, I'm not coming back. My sister's dead.” The family was blue-lighted to QEH, where they recall being shut in a room which required fobs to get in or out of. “Eventually someone came out and just said that was it. There was nothing that they could do, and we had to go in and just turn everything off,” says Clare. “I remember shouting: she was here yesterday, she was here yesterday. And the doctor was like: we know something's gone wrong.” The family asked to spend time with Dena’s body, but were dismayed when they were taken to what they describe as a “cleaning cupboard”, with a man even entering at one point to collect a mop.

The Serious Incident Report published by the hospital listed seven lessons learned from Dena’s death, including the importance of ruling out blood clots, carrying out up-to-date tests, and listening to patients. “Our main thing is that they never gave her that blood thinner,” says Clare. “Instead they sent her home to die in our family home in front of us.” The family is now sharing Dena’s story to raise awareness of the dangers of blood clots in young women. While they say they are sympathetic to the pressure the NHS is under, they feel that because Dena was a healthy 28-year-old, the hospital didn’t take her concerns seriously. Concerns about misogyny in medicine more widely were raised in a report by the Women and Equalities committee last month, which found that the issue “is leaving women in pain and their conditions undiagnosed.” “A lot of biased assumptions were made,” says Dena’s mother Irene.”I think because she went in looking well… They just made an assumption that: she's 28. She's fine…She hadn't had any major surgery. She hadn't been on a long flight. She hadn't been pregnant. But you can still develop a clot even without having had those things.” Irene and Clare are imploring women who take the contraceptive pill to familiarise themselves with the less common symptoms of a blood clot, including fevers, sickness and diarrhea, so they can raise the prospect with doctors if they feel unwell. “I feel very empty now,” says Clare. “And the least I can do for her is make sure her story is out there.” A Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Trust spokesperson said: “We are truly saddened by Dena’s death and recognise the devastating and lasting impact this has on her family and friends. Following Dena’s death, we undertook a full and through review of her care, which has been shared with her family.  \"It is very difficult for us to comment any further ahead of the recently adjourned Coroner’s Inquest, but we continue to offer the Collins’ family our sincere condolences and are here to offer any support they may need.”\n",

      "The case is only one of seven seen in the UK since 2021 and the risk to the wider public is \"low\", it added. The person, who had symptoms, is currently well and has been admitted to a High Consequence Infectious Disease (HCID) unit, as is routine in these cases.

This is different to strains circulating among mammals and birds in the US. The case was picked up as part of routine surveillance for bird flu in the UK, though everyone in contact with the individual and those at highest risk of exposure \"have been offered antiviral treatment\", the agency added. Professor Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser at UKHSA, said: \"The risk of avian flu to the general public remains very low despite this confirmed case. \"We have robust systems in place to detect cases early and take necessary action, as we know that spillover infections from birds to humans may occur. \"Currently there is no evidence of onwards transmission from this case. \"People are reminded not to touch sick or dead birds and it's important that they follow Defra advice about reporting any suspected avian influenza cases.\" Human-to-human transmission of bird flu has never been documented in Europe or the UK, though has occasionally happened abroad. Health minister Andrew Gwynne, said the safety of the public is paramount. \"The risk of wider or onward transmission is very low, however the UK remains prepared and ready to respond to any current and future health threats,\" he added. \"We recently added the H5 vaccine, which protects against avian influenza, to our stockpile as part of our preparedness plans.\" UK chief veterinary officer, Christine Middlemiss, said: \"While avian influenza is highly contagious in birds, this is a very rare event and is very specific to the circumstances on this premises. \"We took swift action to limit the spread of the disease at the site in question, all infected birds are being humanely culled, and cleansing and disinfection of the premises will be undertaken all to strict biosecure standards. \"This is a reminder that stringent biosecurity is essential when keeping animals. \"We are seeing a growing number of avian flu cases in birds on both commercial farms and in backyard flocks across the country. \"Implementing scrupulous biosecurity measures will help protect the health and welfare of your birds from the threat of avian influenza and other diseases.\"\n",

      "Pharmacy leaders have issued a warning over the online sale of weight-loss jabs insisting there is still a risk to patient safety.\n",
      "In a letter to regulators, the  National Pharmacy Association (NPA) has called for tougher rules adding it was aware of people who previously had eating disorders or whose body weight was already low, being wrongly prescribed the drugs. The body, which represents independent community pharmacies, argues a two-way consultation with the patient lasting at least 20 minutes is needed rather than relying on online questionnaires to access drugs such as Wegovy or Mounjaro. Read More: Millions of obese people to be refused 'King Kong of weight loss drugs' on NHS as they face 12-year wait for rollout Read More: Weight loss jabs to help obese people back to work: What are Ozempic and Mounjaro and what are the effects? A person's medical history should also be examined before sellers decide whether or not to dispense a weight loss injection, and regular reviews must take place, it added. Nick Kaye, chairman of the NPA, said: \"It is important that consultations with patients are thorough, allowing a clinician to gain a full picture of someone's suitability for weight loss injections as well as ensuring the patient fully understands the nature of the treatment and any potential side-effects it may cause. \"It is also important to ensure that clinical decisions regarding weight loss injections are not influenced by financial targets or incentives.\" The NPA has written to the General Pharmaceutical Council (GPhC) saying current rules leave the door open for medicines to be supplied without appropriate checks \"and the risk to patient safety remains\". It said the regulator must require pharmacies to conduct a full two-way consultation, including gathering important medical information, for example through GP records. The consultation between prescriber and patient could be via a face-to-face conversation or on the telephone, it suggested. The call comes amid warnings of a boom in demand for weight loss jabs this year as ministers look to expand the rollout of the medication on the NHS. Hundreds of thousands of people are also estimated to get their prescriptions privately through online pharmacies. The NPA has also previously urged patients to avoid buying weight loss injections from unregulated online sellers, who may be selling fake drugs. The Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has also warned patients not to purchase medicines from unregulated suppliers such as beauty salons and via social media. Mr Kaye said: \"Obesity is one of the biggest challenges facing our country and pharmacies want to play their part in helping patients lose and maintain a healthy weight. \"Weight loss injections can play an important role in efforts to tackle obesity when prescribed as part of a carefully managed treatment programme for patients who are most in need of support. \"However, we are concerned that the current regulations allow some patients to inappropriately access weight loss injections without proper consultation or examination of historical medical records. \"There's nothing wrong with online services in principle, but it's important the regulator takes this opportunity to make compulsory a full consultation before dispensing high risk medication such as weight loss injections and ensure supply is prioritised for those in most clinical need, including those with type two diabetes. \"Medicines are not like ordinary goods for sale, they must be handled with great care because they have the power to harm as well as to heal. \"We urge anyone who is unsure about medicine to speak to their pharmacist for advice.\" Weight loss jabs, known as GLP-1 receptor agonists, work by reducing food cravings. In October, the MHRA told health professionals to remind patients of the side effects of the drugs, such as nausea and diarrhoea and, less commonly, gallstones and pancreatitis. It said \"public interest in the use of GLP-1RA products for weight loss is high\" and they are an effective treatment for obese patients with a body mass index of over 30, or over 27 if they also suffer a condition such as heart disease. But it added: \"The benefits and risks of using these medicines for weight loss by individuals who do not have obesity or who are not overweight with weight-related comorbidities have not been studied.\" A spokesperson from the GPhC, said: \"We require all pharmacies, including those operating online, to ensure that the way in which pharmacy services are delivered safeguards the health, safety and wellbeing of patients and the public. \"We have published guidance specifically for the safe and effective provision of pharmacy services at a distance which we expect online pharmacies in Great Britain to follow. \"We will be issuing an updated version shortly, which will set out additional safeguards around high-risk medicines, including medicines used for weight management. \"We have listened carefully to feedback we had on key changes to the updated guidance. \"Our guide for the public on how to keep safe when getting medicines or treatment online gives tips for people going online for medicines, to help them identify legitimate online pharmacies or clinics.\"\n",

      "The CIA now believes the most plausible explanation for the origins of Covid-19 is that it leaked from a laboratory in China, it has emerged.\n",
      "\n",
      "The American spy agency’s assessment has taken aim at a lab in the Chinese city of Wuhan despite admitting it has \"low confidence\" in its own conclusion. The bombshell development comes after new CIA chief John Ratcliffe, installed by President Donald Trump, declassified and released a report on Covid’s origins.  It finds the agency believes the totality of evidence makes a lab leak theory more plausible than the zoonotic theory - which posits that it jumped from animals to humans.  However, the agency's assessment only assigns a low degree of confidence to this argument. A spokesperson from the spy agency said:\"[The] CIA continues to assess that both research-related and natural origin scenarios of the Covid-19 pandemic remain plausible.\" Read more: 'Release Covid data', WHO tells China on five year 'milestone' of deadly outbreak Read more: Flu warning issued as 'quad-demic' surge sees Covid-era masks return to hospitals across Britain The CIA \"will continue to evaluate any available credible new intelligence reporting or open-source information that could change CIA's assessment,\" the spokesperson added. The conclusion was based on fresh analyses of intelligence about the spread of the virus, its scientific properties and the work and conditions of China's virology labs. Legislators have piled the pressure on America's spy agencies for additional information about how the virus emerged and sparked a global health crisis killing millions. But Intelligence officials say it may never be resolved due to a lack of cooperation from Chinese authorities. Meanwhile, scientists still believe the most likely explanation for Covid's origin is that it first circulated in bats before infecting another species and later being passed on to humans.  However, some official investigations have hammered questioning around whether the virus escaped from a lab in Wuhan. A report by the US Department of Energy released two years ago also found the lab leak theory the most plausible.  But like the CIA’s assessment, the energy department also has low confidence in this conclusion. Mr Ratcliffe, who served as director of national intelligence during Mr Trump's first term, has previously said he favours the lab leak scenario. He said back in 2023: \"The lab leak is the only theory supported by science, intelligence, and common sense.\" \n",

      "Let’s embrace the idea comedy can be helpful for mental health - but let’s not frame it as a replacement for proper treatment\n",

      "A man goes to his doctor and says that life has been hard and he’s depressed. \n",
      "The doctor’s face lights up.  “You’re in luck! The world’s most famous clown is in town tonight, go and see him, it will sort you out!”.  The man starts to cry.  “But doctor,” he says, “that’s me.”  Whilst an old joke, in real life the NHS is now prescribing comedy for mental health treatment.  It’s backed by Dr Simon Opher, Labour MP.  As a comedian and NHS doctor, I can see the appeal - after all, laughter is a powerful thing.  But while comedy might help some people, we shouldn’t turn it into a cure-all or, worse, use it to undermine the role of antidepressants. There’s no one-size-fits-all approach to mental health.  Everyone’s experience of depression is different, and so are the solutions that work for them.  Some might find real benefit in comedy - whether that’s performing, watching, or just being in a room full of people laughing together.  I know from experience that I always feel better after a gig than before.  Comedy has always been the outlet that gets me through - keeps me, me.  But I’d never say it should replace proper medical treatment for those who need it. Depression isn’t just about feeling a bit low, it’s a complex condition with many causes. Antidepressants exist for a reason: they’re designed to treat depression.  For many of the 8.7 million people in England who took antidepressants in 2023/24, they’re life-changing, whether taking them for a short time or longer.  Demonising them is dangerous.  The right approach to mental health is holistic - therapy, medication, lifestyle changes, and, sure, maybe even comedy, if that works for you.  Comedy can be an honest, cathartic process.  There’s something transformative about taking the hardest moments of your life and turning them into something you and others can laugh about.  Personally, I’ve got a big show coming up at The Comedy Store in April exploring a serious medical problem - because sometimes, finding the humour in something painful helps you get through it.  So yes, let’s embrace the idea that comedy can be helpful.  But let’s not frame it as a replacement for proper treatment.  Mental health care should always be about what actually helps people.  I also don’t want to turn every comedy club into a walk-in clinic.  The reality is, some people need jokes, some need medicine, and most need a bit of both. _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Dr Ed Patrick is an anaesthetist, comedian and host of the \"Comedians' Surgery\" podcast.

      "X Factor star Josh Cuthbert has opened up about dealing with mental health struggles while in the limelight - and why he refuses to return to the music industry.\n",
      "Josh Cuthbert, 31, rose to fame as part of boyband Union J during 2012's X Factor. However, having starred in the West End from the age of 13, he's no stranger to the spotlight and the challenges that come with it. \"I've had a really long mental health journey,\" Josh told LBC. \"I think I suffered with my mental health when I was younger without even realising, before I even knew what mental health was really.  \"And then I've been in the entertainment industry since I was 13.\" The Samaritans ambassador is now urging men to open up and be honest about their mental health as part of Time to Talk Day. He said he struggled to discuss his mental health due to \"lad culture\" - making it particularly difficult to face when Union J broke up. \"We put things down or we turn things into banter as opposed to actually having a deep, meaningful and vulnerable chat,\" Josh said. \"There aren't as many role models [for men]. So that's why I think it's even more important in friendship groups for us as men to really open up and be able to create a safe space for people to be vulnerable with feelings.\" Read more: William and Kate to launch mental health programme in Sandringham Read more: TikTok to ban teenagers from using beauty filters over mental health concerns Sharing his experience in the public eye, he said: \"I was in the West End when I was a young lad...so I'm sure that had an impact on my mental health from a young age.  \"But I think it was the moment that I went on X Factor with Union J and everything started to go really well, and we were in the limelight and we had attention and we had the huge pressure of having to perform and be the best... it's a world that you can't really prepare for.  \"I think that my mental health suffered hugely as a result of that. \"I was 19 in the first X Factor audition, and then I was 20 when the live shows were on. And then I experienced most of my adult life in the public eye, which was really quite challenging because there's no notebook that you get on how to deal with things.\" However, the 31-year-old faced his biggest challenge after the band came to an end, saying he felt ok to begin with before it really hit him hard. \"I sort of thought, I'm not that bad. I don't feel that bad. I can kind of get on with my life again and explore other opportunities.  \"But then a couple of years after, it hit me really hard, and that's when I went through this incredibly challenging period.\" He explained: \"I grew up always wanting to be a singer, and I grew up always wanting to be in a boyband. That was a dream of mine my whole life.  \"But I think the reality of the dream was a real letdown.\" Despite being in a band with three others, the singer-turned-influencer said he felt \"extremely lonely and vulnerable\" at times. \"I do miss the singing,\" Josh said. \"I do miss being on stage. That's the place where I feel most happiest in my life.  \"When I'm on stage performing, that is the place that I just feel at one and at ease with myself.\" However, Josh said he would struggle to put himself out there again as he still felt \"mentally scarred\". \"I don't know if I'm strong enough to do it again,\" he said. Josh has since moved on to becoming an influencer in recent years, sharing fashion and fitness tips with his 448,000 Instagram followers. He said he doesn't feel the need to put on a happy facade for his followers and instead remains as candid as possible to inspire others to open up about their mental health. \"Just living life is challenging and everyone has their insecurities and challenges that they go through,\" he said. \"I try to be really honest with my feelings. There was a time, I think it started in 2019 and went on until 2022, where I genuinely didn't want to be here anymore.  \"I genuinely thought that I would be happier if I wasn't alive. That was the brutal reality of it. And I felt that so many times.  \"I think because I'm a man... I don't know many other men that speak about it, and quite often in male friendship groups we don't have those chats. \"That's where I really suffered, because I was almost feeling these feelings and I was extremely depressed, extremely insecure, extremely low and suicidal at times that I would try and speak to people, but their reaction would be, 'Oh, come on, mate, what have you got to be down about? You've got a great life, you've got this.'\" When the singer realised how much his personal struggles were impacting his wife, and creating an \"uncomfortable environment\" at home, he turned to Samaritans. \"I was in such a dark headspace that I literally didn't see any light at the end of the tunnel,\" he said. \"I thought, this is not fair on Chloe. I have to talk. I have to vent my feelings to someone else. I have to reach out to someone.  \"I have to speak to someone that doesn't know me, that isn't going to tell me the things I want to hear.\" He said it was such a \"simple thing\" but just knowing he wasn't on his own made all the difference. \"They're there to listen, they're there to chat, and they're there to make you feel less alone,\" he said. \"And actually, that's exactly what they did for me.  \"It's a really powerful thing that you can do that we're so lucky to have access to.\" The star now works with Samaritans to build awareness around mental health. He is running the London Marathon every year in his 30s to help raise money for them. \"It's a really brilliant charity,\" he said. \"I'm very honoured to be a part of their ambassadorship.\" Sharing advice for those suffering with their mental health, he said: \"Take comfort in the fact that you're not alone.  \"There's a lot of people that are in the same position as you and that's a really powerful thing. You can almost feel this kind of sense of community of people that are going through similar things to you.  \"Speak to someone you trust... just talking to that one person, it will be one of the hardest things, especially if you've not spoken about your mental health issues before.  \"If you can just speak to that one person you trust, the moment you do that, your walls just get let down completely and you let someone else in. You let someone else help and you just immediately feel less alone.  \"Another major thing is don't compare yourself to other people. We're all on this crazy world. We're all doing different paths. We're all having different journeys to end up to where we're getting. There is no right or wrong way.\" Those feeling distressed or suicidal can call Samaritans for help on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org in the UK.

      "A mental health charity has called for more support from the government as it faces £250,000 cuts due to increases to national insurance and the national living wage.\n",
      "Coventry, Warwickshire and Worcestershire Mind CEO Steven Hill said that the charity was \"propping up\" health and social care services - yet has been left to struggle during its toughest period. With upcoming changes to national insurance and the national living wage, the charity is being forced to make cuts, despite there being a higher a demand than ever before. It comes on Time to Talk Day, with Brits encouraged to open up and be honest about their mental health - be it with a friend, family member or colleague. The charity is holding a number of events to mark the occasion, including chats and activities at their wellbeing hubs. Members of the team will also be visiting businesses and organisations across the region to talk about the importance of mental health. But such services are set to be hit hard in coming months, with the charity having to make \"really tough decisions\" to deal with financial pressures. The changes, due to come in from April this year, will cost the charity around £250,000 - and could result in staff cuts as it fights to keep its doors open. Read more: William and Kate to launch mental health programme in Sandringham Read more: TikTok to ban teenagers from using beauty filters over mental health concerns \"One of the big challenges for any charity at the moment is how they're going to afford the national increases,' Mr Hill told LBC.  \"Both the national living wage and national insurance have come at somewhat of a significant cost to us. We're talking hundreds of thousands of pounds we've got to find a year to cover those insurance additional costs.  \"This is money that we have to find from pots of money that we generate through income generation and fundraising.  \"Our contracts are not changing significantly so we're not going to see that money coming through the commission services that we have. So we've got to find that money.  \"And this is all coming at a time when we're seeing more and more demand for our services.  \"We're seeing more people wanting more to access the support that we offer and more people coming forward that have more complex mental health needs.  \"So we're having to support people perhaps for longer than we would have originally supported people for because of the complexity of what they're dealing with.  Mr Hill said he recognised that the government had a difficult job trying to balance the budget of the nation, but it is coming at a cost to services that are needed most of all. \"It's really concerning,\" he said. \"When it comes to things like fundraising, people have less money in their pockets now too.  \"Trying to get people to raise money for you is hard because we're all having to make some cuts in our own lives in terms of what we can afford to do.\" Mr Hill continued: \"We are propping up health and social care - that is what we do. If we weren't there, where would people go? The only option would be for them to go to health and social care to get the support they need.\" The charity has already seen an influx of people going to them due to NHS waiting lists being too long. \"I do feel the government should consider the charitable sector,\" Mr Hill went on to say. \"They should consider the fact that we're often the ones that are paying the lowest salaries.  \"We've been hit double whammy because the national living wage is also a pressure on us. We are potentially going to have to make some really tough decisions as an organisation as to what we can afford and that is a really hard thing to have to do when we know that demand is out there.\" The charity has already been forced to make several cuts over the last few years, without factoring in other rising costs such as energy bills. \"We run a lot of residential properties,\" Mr Hill said. \"We don't get reduced rates because of being a charity.  \"We've already stripped back as much as we can strip back when it comes to being as cost efficient as we can.  \"The next option is going to have to be whether we can afford... the biggest resource we have is staffing, unfortunately.\" Having worked for the charity for 30 years, Mr Hill said: \"I do what I do because I love the impact that we have and the support we can give to people. \"I love my job so much, but it doesn't come without its challenges at times. And this is probably one of the biggest challenges we've ever had to face.\" Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced in her October Budget that employers' National Insurance contributions would rise by 1.2 per cent to 15 per cent from April 2025. The National Living Wage for people aged 21 or older is also rising by 6.7 per cent - from £11.44 an hour to £12.21. Following the announcement, Mr Hill reached out to several local MPs for support. Manuela Perteghella, the Lib Dem MP for Stratford-on-Avon, told LBC: \"The Liberal Democrats have repeatedly pushed the government to exempt healthcare charities from the hike on NICs. \"Mental health charities, as well as other healthcare charitable organisation, do incredible work in the community, in schools, and in other settings across my constituency of Stratford-on-Avon, and they should not be penalised in the budget.\" The Treasury was contacted for comment.\n",

      "England and Scotland have been placed under mandatory prevention zones amid an alarming surge in cases of bird flu. \n",
      "\n",
      "Bird keepers, including anyone from pet owners to poultry farmers, are facing new restrictions to limit the spread of the disease.  The so-called Avian Influenza Prevention Zone (AIPZ) requires bird keepers to adhere to strict hygiene measures. All birds must be kept indoors across York, North Yorkshire, Kingston Upon Hull, Lincolnshire, Norfolk, Suffolk and Shropshire. Additional biosecurity measures include keeping free range birds and wild birds separate in different fenced areas. Bird keepers have also been urged to clean and disinfect footwear while looking after the animals. Ducks and geese must also be separated from other poultry. Read more: Cases of bird flu confirmed at Yorkshire poultry farm - with protection zone put in place Read more: Starmer's plans for NHS will turn A&E into a 'war zone', bosses warn PM  Information released by the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs and Animal and Plant Health Agency states: “In response to the increased number of cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza in poultry in new areas of the country and the continued heightened risk levels in poultry and kept birds, the Avian Influenza Prevention Zone (AIPZ) is being extended to mitigate the risk of further outbreaks of the disease. “This means that from 00:01 on Monday 27 January 2025 the AIPZ mandating enhanced biosecurity and housing for kept birds currently in force across East Riding of Yorkshire, City of Kingston Upon Hull, Lincolnshire, Norfolk, Suffolk will be extended to also include the unitary authorities of Shropshire, York and North Yorkshire.” It comes after the first case of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N5 of the current outbreak was confirmed in England on the 5 November 2024. Since then, a further 22 cases have been detected. UK Chief Veterinary Officer Christine Middlemiss has pleaded with bird keepers to check which requirements apply to them.  She has urged them \"to continue to exercise robust biosecurity measures, remain alert for any signs of disease and report suspected disease immediately to the Animal and Plant Health Agency\". A 3km protection zone will be set up around any infected premises, which are also required to house all birds. Bird flu is a highly infectious type of influenza that spreads among birds and only in very rare cases, it can affect humans. Currently, there are several strains of the virus that have caused concern in recent years (although there are many more) and most of them don't infect humans. However, while those strains don't infect people easily, and it isn't usually spread from human to human, there have been a small number of human infections recorded from around the world.\n",

      "The Princess of Wales is said to be \"delighted\" at plans to expand a programme to promote babies' wellbeing across the UK.\n",
      "The Royal Foundation Centre for Early Childhood and the Institute of Health Visiting (iHV) have confirmed the expansion of the trial of a tool used by health visitors within routine checks to eight new areas. The Alarm Distress Baby Scale (ADBB) model is a system Kate saw in practice during a 2022 visit to Denmark that assesses how babies interact with their environment. Read More: Kate keeps promise in emotional return to hospital where she had cancer treatment Read More: Prince William hails Kate's 'remarkable strength' as he sends touching birthday message Under the ADBB model, a baby's eye contact, facial expressions, vocalisation and activity levels are studied to help health professionals and families better understand the ways they express their feelings, and to support parents with bonding. It can also be used to recognise early signs of psychological distress, enabling specialist support to be accessed as soon as it is needed. After Kate saw health visitors in Denmark using the tool, the Centre for Early Childhood then worked with the Institute of Health Visiting (iHV) and Oxford University to test it in the UK. Health visitors involved in phase one - which took place in South Warwickshire NHS Foundation Trust and Humber Teaching NHS Foundation Trust - said they were able to have more meaningful conversations with parents and carers about the emotional wellbeing of their baby. They said they were also able to promote positive parent-infant interactions, attachment, and bonding, and to identify those babies and families in need of greater support. The second phase is funded by a £210,000 grant from the Centre for Early Childhood and will run until March 2026 in eight areas across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. It is understood the Princess of Wales, who has made promoting the early years development of children a major part of her public work, is thrilled by the expansion of the trial. A spokesperson for the princess added: \"The work of the Centre for Early Childhood continues to shine a light on just how important the first five years of life are for any baby and the role we can all play. \"The Princess is delighted to see the expansion of the ADBB trial and looks forward to following it closely.\" Christian Guy, executive director of the Centre for Early Childhood, said: \"We know that warm, loving, responsive interactions with those closest to them during the earliest weeks and months of a baby's life are crucial in promoting positive brain development. \"Health visitors do such a vital job in our communities. I am delighted that we are now able to give more teams across the UK the support they need to help thousands of families to better understand their babies and build nurturing relationships, laying the strongest possible foundations for all that is to come in the years that follow.\" Alison Morton, chief executive of the Institute of Health Visiting, said: \"As we know, babies can't talk, but there is significant evidence that their early experiences influence their future outcomes. \"The expansion of the use of the modified ADBB tool in a wider range of health visiting services will allow us to consider its future implementation and sustainability, and ensure more families get the right support and babies can thrive.\"\n",

      "If care is not moved out of hospitals and closer to people's homes then the equivalent of around half the population will be visiting A&E every year by 2034, England's top doctor has warned.\n",
      "\n",
      "Professor Sir Stephen Powis, NHS England's national medical director, said that if the NHS is to \"avoid a situation of overcrowded A&Es\" in a decade's time then it must \"go for broke\" in moving care from hospital to the community. A&Es around the country have reported extreme pressure in recent weeks, with many declaring critical incidents coupled with distressing reports about the care patients have received. In a keynote speech on \"The current state of the NHS\" at Liverpool Medical Institution on Wednesday evening, Sir Stephen is expected to say: \"I want to particularly focus today on moving care into the community. \"Because we know that if A&E attendances increase at the same rate as they have over the past 10 years - NHS staff will need to manage six million more A&E attendances every year from 2034. \"That would mean the equivalent of almost half the population attend A&E at least once every year - that is simply not feasible for a 21st-century health system. Read more: Charities call for end to 'cruel and archaic' practice of jailing people who can’t pay council tax \"Instead, millions of patients will need to receive the care and support they need outside of hospital. \"The NHS is already on the right track in delivering this - whether in the rollout of high-tech virtual wards or two-hour urgent community response teams.\" A&Es in England faced the busiest year on record in 2024, with 27.42 million attendances across the year - 7.1% higher than in 2023, according to NHS England. Rough projections suggest there could be 33,505,330 attendances in 2034. Sir Stephen will address medical students, doctors and recently retired and will urge them to engage in the 10-year health plan. \"If the NHS is to avoid a situation of overcrowded A&Es in 10 years' time - we must go for broke in moving care from hospital to the community,\" he is expected to add. \"The mechanism for how we do that is still up for discussion. \"So as doctors of the past, present and future - we need your experience and expertise to support us to go further and faster. \"I urge everyone in this room to come forward with your experiences of what is and isn't working in the NHS - so we can make the best practice, normal practice across the country as part of the 10-Year Health Plan,\" he will add. Health Secretary Wes Streeting has invited patients and NHS staff to take part in a \"national conversation\" to shape the plan, a central plank of Labour's health policy. The party has pledged to build \"an NHS fit for the future\", with a greater emphasis on preventing ill health, shifting care from hospitals to the community and harnessing the latest technology to improve care. Sir Stephen's comments come after a report last week found patients are dying in corridors and sometimes going undiscovered for hours, while sick people are being left to soil themselves. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) report, which has been described as \"harrowing\", told of patients sitting for days in chairs - so-called \"chair care\" - people left in corridors, delays to treatment and the elderly unable to get help because of a lack of call bells and not enough staff. The RCN found patients are regularly treated in bathrooms, shower areas, cloakrooms, bereavement rooms and even viewing rooms where families visit dead relatives. It has also called for immediate Government action to end \"corridor care\", which it says has become normalised and is not just occurring in the winter months. Leading doctors from the Royal College of Physicians (RCP) have echoed concerns, saying there should be a \"zero tolerance\" approach to NHS corridor care. In December, more than 54,000 patients in England waited more than 12 hours for admission to a bed, while research shows that patients who spend more than 12 hours in A&E are twice as likely to die within 30 days as those dealt with within two hours.\n",

      "Patients are lying in their faeces, being treated in cloakrooms and bathrooms, and dying in corridors without anyone noticing according to a new ‘harrowing’ report into the NHS.\n",
      "The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) published new findings into what is going on in England's hospitals as staff try to manage the number of people needing care. The 'harrowing' report tells of patients sitting for days in chairs - so-called 'chair care' - due to a lack of beds, patients piling up in corridors, delays to treatment and the elderly unable to get help due to a lack of resources and staff. The RCN called for immediate Government action to end \"corridor care\", which it says has become normalised and is not just occurring in the winter months. The experiences of more than 5,000 nursing staff across the UK, with more than 4,000 from England, contained within the 460-page report highlight how patients are \"routinely coming to harm\" and deaths are happening. Testimonies from nurses in the report include: Nurses described the state of the NHS as 'no different than a third-world country', and many described it as 'tiring, exhausting and soul-destroying'. One nurse, who wished to remain anonymous, said: \"This is not nursing, this is firefighting.\" Read more: NHS hospital posts job ads for 'corridor nurse' amid 'significant pressure in urgent and emergency care' A survey of NHS nursing staff for the study found 67% said they are delivering care every day in overcrowded or unsuitable places. More than nine in 10 said care is unsafe. One nurse was emotional as she told a news briefing there were 30 chairs in their emergency corridor but no extra staff for those patients. She said: \"The risk of patients dying and not being noticed is very high, everybody is stretched....\" She also told how staff experienced violence from patients due to long waiting times, adding the experience of working in the NHS \"makes a hole in your soul\". Professor Nicola Ranger, RCN chief executive, told the briefing the report was \"harrowing\", adding staff were leaving because they \"cannot do it any more\". She added: \"This winter is absolutely no surprise to any of us. \"Wards, departments were escalated into areas they shouldn't be all through June, July, August, September - it's become normal to put patients in all sorts of areas that I can promise you, being a chief nurse for nearly 10 years before this job, prior to Covid, would have been seen as abhorrent and totally unacceptable. \"That's the real tragedy here, is that care that would have been seen prior to Covid as shocking has been normalised.\" She said the NHS did not have enough beds or nurses to meet demand and that was occurring throughout the year, adding: \"I really want to make sure that flu is not used as the excuse for this.\" Read more: Health Secretary 'distressed and ashamed’ for patients as six hospitals declare critical incidents amid winter flu virus Regarding \"chair care\", Prof Ranger said: \"We talk about 'fit to sit' as the new mantra.\" Turning to the Government, she said there was a need for ministers to acknowledge the \"scale of the problem\", adding that all of this could have been predicted. Health Foundation assistant director of policy Tim Gardner said: \"Delays in A&E and resorting to corridor care is not a safe way to run a health service, putting patients at risk of avoidable harm and, as these testimonies highlight, taking a major toll on NHS staff. He said that trolley wait times in A&E hit record highs in 2024, and that \"Such delays were a rarity before the pandemic but are now the worst we have seen since records began.\" Read more: NHS experiencing 'pandemic-level' pressure as flu cases soar - with cold snap to make things worse as temperatures drop He added: \"This is a symptom of an NHS worn down by the pandemic and the decade of underinvestment that preceded it.\" Shadow health secretary Ed Argar said it was \"down to Wes Streeting to act now\" to increase capacity in hospitals. He said: \"The Government talks about future reforms, but has little to say on what it will actually do to help patients now. \"It's down to Wes Streeting to act now to provide further support and increased capacity to our hospitals this winter, as Conservatives did, and as we've called on him to do.\" Liberal Democrat health spokeswoman Helen Morgan said: \"This report is harrowing. To think that patients are receiving desperately needed care in car parks and dying patients are being left to fend for themselves in corridors should make us sick to our stomachs.\n",

      "Youngsters with a diet high in ultra-processed foods (UPFs) risk being left with dodgy teeth and a shrunk jaw, experts have warned. \n",
      "\n",
      "Researchers have shone a spotlight on Brits’ unhealthy diets in recent years, with UPFs accounting for nearly 60% of our diets.  For young people, the figure is even higher, with nearly 70% of adolescent’s caloric intake coming from UPFs. The foods, which typically have additives one wouldn’t normally find in their kitchen, can range from anything like crisps and sweets to supermarket white bread and flavoured yoghurts.  A number of studies have linked diets high in UPFs to type 2 diabetes, heart disease, cancer and other life-threatening illnesses.  But for children, a high UPF can cause some other surprising symptoms too, according to a recent study by researchers from the Catholic University of Valencia. Read more: A glass of milk a day cuts risk of bowel cancer, study reveals Read more: SNP slammed for making Scotland a ‘joyless place’ as birthday cakes and sweets to be banned in nurseries Dr Laura Marques Martinez, an expert in pediatric dentistry and co-author of the study, said: “Chewing plays a crucial role in the proper development of the jaws as it stimulates bone growth, strengthens facial muscles, and promotes proper dental alignment. “Chewing solid and fibrous foods, such as fruits, vegetables, or natural proteins, exercises the jaw, helping to prevent issues like malocclusion (misalignment of teeth) and deficiencies in the size and shape of dental arches. “On the other hand, diets based on ultra-processed foods, which are soft and require minimal effort to chew, negatively impact jaw development.”“These foods, by failing to adequately stimulate the maxillofacial muscles and bones, can lead to underdeveloped bone structures and increase the risk of malocclusion and respiratory problems.”The researchers kept tabs on the eating habits, dental structures and skull shapes of 25 three to five-year-olds as part of the study. They found those who consumed softer foods were more likely to have buck teeth lack natural gaps, which are needed between teeth in early childhood to make room for larger teeth when they start growing.  Professor Tim Spector, a leading British diet expert and founder of the ZOE app, told The Telegraph: “We've been going through this epidemic of jaw shrinkage for a few hundred years but it has really accelerated over the last two decades. “As a result, we're seeing a huge rise in orthodontic problems in children – a massive use of braces, and far more crooked teeth Research into the impact of these unhealthy goods has found that the UK's reliance on foods high in sugar, salt, and fat, is having a 'devastating' impact. A study by the Food, Farming and Countryside Commission (FOC) report found the UK's estimated spend of £268bn can be explained by three areas: NHS spend (£67.5bn), welfare system (£10.1bn) and social care services (£14.3bn).The finances go towards treating diet-related diseases.  These include type 2 diabetes, kidney disease, and cardiovascular problems. Meanwhile in May, researchers at Harvard University tracked 115,000 healthy US adults over the course of three decades.  They found a link between eating ultra-processed foods (UPFs) and the risk of dying.The most harmful diets contain high amounts of ready-made processed meat and fish products.  These diets increased the risk of death by 13 per cent. Food in this category includes items like shop-bought sausages, burgers, fish fingers, chicken nuggets and turkey twizzlers.\n",

      "\n",
      "New guidance drawn up by the SNP is aimed at helping young people cut out \"unhealthy foods”. It comes after 2022 estimates revealed around 6% of children in Scotland were at risk of having weight problems. The ban, which is also set to include fish finger, chicken nuggets and other deep fried goods, will be imposed from August 1. The full set of guidance can be found in the SNP’s 108-page Setting the Table report. Chips, sweet treats like chocolate and fruit juice, will also be banned, as will other popular goodies like spaghetti hoops and cereals with over 15g of sugar per 100g, and most breads.

Childcare providers will only be allowed to give youngsters water and milk to drink, with smoothies also off the cards. Critics have flooded in to slam the report. X user Agent P wrote: “No, it’s not April 1st. “The SNP really are going to bnan birthday cakes in nurseries. “What a joyless place they have turned Scotland into.” Scotland’s Conservative Party spokesman has blasted the “draconian`” rules as an example of “nanny state overreach.” He said: “Everybody wants to promote healthier eating, especially when children are young. “But it won’t happen by imposing such draconian rules or blanket prohibitions. “These guidelines risk becoming an onerous requirement for childminders and nurseries. “And most people will see things like a ban on birthday cake as the worst kind of nanny state overreach.” The report reads: “Many families like to celebrate their child’s birthday and other special events, often by bringing in a cake or sweets to the childcare setting to share. \"Unfortunately, this can mean that some children are eating these unhealthy foods several times; this may be at the childminder’s house, in the nursery or playgroup as well as at home.\" Martin Whitfield, the Scottish Labour Children and Young Person’s spokesman has said the rules are “out of proportion. He said: “It’s right that nurseries and playgroups promote healthy-eating habits but this heavy-handed approach seems out of all proportion. “The Scottish government should support nurseries to offer healthy choices instead of forging ahead with this sweeping ban.” The Scottish government argued the guidance was developed alongside experts in child health and nutrition. The report reads: “Many families like to celebrate their child’s birthday and other special events, often by bringing in a cake or sweets to the childcare setting to share. “Unfortunately, this can mean that some children are eating these unhealthy foods several times a week...An alternative way of celebrating the occasion should be adopted and be part of your food and nutrition policy.” The rules will be imposed by Scotland’s care watchdog - the Care Inspectorate - which will “expect registered childcare providers to be able to demonstrate how they are meeting this guidance” during routine inspections, according to the Mail. The Care Inspectorate said: “Nutritional options provided by care services have always been a part of our inspections.” It comes amid a boom in the scientific as well as health and fitness communities raising the awareness about ultra-processed foods.  Research into the impact of these unhealthy goods has found that the UK's reliance on foods high in sugar, salt, and fat, is having a 'devastating' impact.

      "Tony Blair has warned British people against self-diagnosing with mental health conditions, pointing to the country's spiralling sickness benefits bill.\n",
      "The former Labour Prime Minister said that many issues simply represented \"the challenges of life\", rather than medical conditions such as anxiety or depression. The number of people with common mental health conditions has risen in recent years, alongside greater emphasis in society on 'awareness' of such conditions. Many people view this as positive, as people are more likely to take action and seek help to tackle mental disorders and stop them from becoming worse. But some, like Blair, have warned that this has also resulted in some people 'medicalising' their mental condition, which they may otherwise have considered a normal part of everyday life.

According to the previous government in a statement last year, the benefits bill is set to rise to £28 billion in just three years.  The number of new people given sickness benefits (PIP) for mental health conditions each month has more than doubled since the pandemic. Blair, who was PM from 1997-2007, told the Jimmy's Jobs of the Future podcast: \"I think we have become very, very focused on mental health and with people self-diagnosing. \"We're spending vastly more on mental health now than we did a few years ago.  \"And it's hard to see what the objective reasons for that are.\" The former PM added: \"Life has its ups and downs and everybody experiences those. And you've got to be careful of encouraging people to think they've got some sort of condition other than simply confronting the challenges of life.  \"We need a proper conversation about this because you really cannot afford to be spending the amount of money we're spending on mental health.\"\n",

      "A British-born former child star who was blind and had cerebral palsy \"died needlessly\" in the Los Angeles wildfires, his mother has claimed.\n",
      "Rory Callium Sykes, 32, said ‘leave me’ before he died from carbon monoxide poisoning in the LA wildfires. Shelley Sykes, his mum, said he lost his life when the cottage he lived in on his mum’s estate in Malibu burned down on Thursday. Ms Sykes travelled to her local fire department after struggling to get through to the emergency services to move her son from his self-contained cottage next to her property, while flames surrounded the area. She was struggling with a broken arm when the fire reached her house, which prevented her from evacuating her son by herself. \"He was my baby, and he died needlessly,\" she told Australian TV channel Network 10. \"Guess what didn't work? 911. All the phone lines were down,\" she said. \"He said, 'Mum, leave me', and no mum can leave their kid, and I've got a broken arm. I couldn't lift him. I couldn't move him.” She reportedly drove 400 meters to the local fire station, who told her they couldn’t help as they had ‘no water’, the news programme said. \"When the fire department brought me back, his cottage was burned to the ground,\" she said. Ms Sykes said her son, who appeared on TV show Kiddy Kapers, died of carbon monoxide poisoning. Las Virgenes Municipal Water denied her claims, according to US reports, saying the \"water service did remain available and uninterrupted to her property and the entire surrounding community\".

She said: “It is with great sadness that I have to announce the death of my beautiful son Rory Sykes to the Malibu fires yesterday. “I’m totally heart broken. British born Australian living in America, a wonderful son, a gift born on mine & his grandma's birthday 29 July 92, Rory Callum Sykes.” She shared how Rory enjoyed traveling, and had co-founded a charity with his mum, calling him ‘a true humanitarian’.She said he was a big fan of Apple products, and the video game Runescape. She added: “Rory was born blind with cerebral palsy & had difficulty walking. He overcame so much with surgeries & therapies to regain his sight & to be able to learn to walk. “Despite the pain, he still enthused about traveling the world with me from Africa to Antarctica.” Ms Sykes described how her son’s cottage on her 17 acre estate burned down and that she “couldn’t put out the cinders on his roof with a hose because the water was switched off by Las Virgenes Municipal Water. “Even the 50 brave fire fighters had no water all day! “He will be incredibly missed by Shelley Sykes, mama his pet peacocks Edgee & Mickie & all his online fans around the world!” Read more: Harry and Meghan make surprise appearance in LA as they comfort wildfire victims and first responders The death toll from the wildfires rose to 16 as crews battled to cut off the spreading blazes before potentially strong winds return that could push the flames towards some of the city's most famous landmarks. Jason Oppenheim, star of US reality programme Selling Sunset, said landlords are taking advantage of people being displaced by the fires which began on Tuesday, just north of central LA, and have burned more than 12,000 structures. Since offering to represent those who have lost their homes for free, the reality star said Oppenheim Group agents have \"received dozens and dozens of calls from people who have lost their homes in the fires\". \"It's all hands on deck right now, but it's really difficult because there are thousands of people who are displaced without places to stay,\" he told BBC One programme Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg. \"The hotels are overwhelmed all the way down to Newport Beach and even into San Diego you can't get a hotel room right now. \"And even, unfortunately - and this is something that I want to discuss, because I think it should be exposed - but we're having landlords taking advantage of the situation. \"I had a client, we sent him to a house that was asking 13,000 dollars (£10,600) a month. \"He offered 20,000 dollars (£16,400) a month, and he offered to pay six months up front. And the landlord said, \"No, I want 23,000 dollars (18,800) a month'. \"You know, there are price-gouging laws in California that are just being ignored right now. \"And this isn't the time to be taking advantage of situations, and it's also illegal to take advantage of a natural disaster.\" EastEnders actress Patsy Palmer and Star Wars actor Mark Hamill were among the celebrities who described how their homes had survived the wind-driven fires. US reality star Paris Hilton launched an emergency fund to support families who have been displaced, starting it with a personal donation of 100,000 dollars (£82,000) after she watched her Malibu home \"burn to the ground on live TV\". Actors Mel Gibson, Miles Teller, Jeff Bridges, Billy Crystal, Jamie Chung and Bryan Greenberg are among the other stars who have lost their homes. The Hills stars Spencer Pratt and Heidi Montag, talk show host Ricki Lake, and songwriter Diane Warren have also lost properties, with reports that Sir Anthony Hopkins' home burned to the ground in the Pacific Palisades fire. Grammy-nominated musician Halsey said she was evacuated from a home she had recently moved into and added: \"Can't even wrap my head around this.\" US actress Jennifer Garner was among the stars volunteering, providing food relief for evacuees and the emergency services, working alongside World Central Kitchen founder chef Jose Andres at one of the charity's pop-up locations around California. Standing amid the rubble of her home town of 25 years, an emotional Garner told US outlet MSNBC: \"I did lose a friend, and for our church it's really tender, so I don't feel like I should talk about her yet. \"I did lose a friend who did not get out in time.\" Other stars including X Factor judge Simon Cowell used their platforms to share links to evacuation resources and donation pages. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex visited a meal distribution site, hugging people and speaking to emergency crews on Friday. Oscar-nominated actress Sharon Stone encouraged stars to make donations to a distribution centre, which prompted Academy Award winner Halle Berry to pack up \"my entire closet\" to \"help all of the displaced families that are in need of the basics\". After members of the Kardashian family were reportedly evacuated from their homes, matriarch Kris Jenner said her family approached their favourite Armenian restaurant to \"feed a few fire houses\". Kim Kardashian said she had \"spoken to many firefighters who are up all night long using every ounce of their strength to save our community\". Entertainment company LiveNation said a charity concert, FireAid, will take place at the Intuit Dome in Los Angeles, \"dedicated to rebuilding communities devastated by wildfires and supporting efforts to prevent future fire disasters throughout southern California\". The event is billed as an \"evening of music and solidarity\" and will take place on January 30, with performers yet to be announced. TV host Melissa Rivers told CNN she managed to save the Emmy awarded to her late mother, comedian and actress Joan Rivers, while fleeing her home. The fires have thrown Hollywood's awards season into disarray, with the Critics Choice Awards and Producers Guild Awards nominations among the events postponed.\n",

      "A hospital in north London has advertised for a corridor nurse amid a surge in admissions as the NHS battles with a deepening winter crisis. \n",
      "Spaces in hospitals are running low this winter as the health service grapples with surging pressure amid a rise in cases of flu and other seasonal illnesses.  Some hospitals have become so overwhelmed that they have been forced to put patients in corridors due to running out of space in rooms. Now, the Whittington Hospital in Archway, North London, has posted adverts calling for nurses to take on 12-hour “corridor care” shifts, according to The Sunday Times.  The Whittington Health NHS Trust, which oversees the hospital, said in a statement it has faced \"very significant pressure in urgent and emergency care\". Read more: 'Nurse' left in critical condition after hospital stabbing as man arrested on suspicion of attempted murder Read more: UK set for the 'coldest night' of winter as temperatures plummet as low as -20C It said: \"In these circumstances, we may have to provide care in corridors, as an absolute last resort.\"In common with other hospitals, where this is necessary we bring in additional staff on a temporary basis to ensure that care can be delivered as safely and compassionately as possible to patients. \"We have worked with partners across the health and care system to request mutual aid at times of worst pressures, to alleviate the impact and ensure patients get care as quickly and safely as possible this winter. \"We apologise to any patient whose care has not met our usual high standards due to the exceptional level of demand and are grateful to all of our hardworking staff for their commitment during this period of extraordinary pressure.\" It comes as multiple critical incidents have been declared across a number of UK hospitals as many services struggle under a perfect storm of cold weather, respiratory conditions, flu, Covid-19, and norovirus. Health Secretary Wes Streeting told LBC earlier this week he is \"distressed and ashamed\" about what patients are going through as six hospitals have declared critical incidents in their A&Es. He told Shelagh Fogarty he is determined to \"save the NHS that saved my life and to build the national care service this country deserves\". He also stated that if the government doesn’t achieve their  \"ambitious\" targets for the NHS it’s \"my head on the chopping block\". A critical incident indicates a hospital or service is no longer able to function properly. This status can be declared as a result of exceptional demand or even a significant staffing issue.  During a critical incident hospitals can implement special measures such as prioritizing urgent care to ensure patient safety. Warnings have been issued in Plymouth, Hampshire, Birmingham and on Merseyside and some patients have had to wait up to 50 hours to be seen.\n",

      "Wes Streeting is right. No one should die in hospital when they don’t want or need to be there. The state of end of life care needs to change.  \n",
      "\n",
      "In an interview on LBC Radio this week, The Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Wes Streeting said he was ‘ashamed’ of the experiences of some patients in the NHS.  He described ‘heart-breaking’ conditions in A&E, including people being driven in ambulances to emergency departments to die because the right end of life care isn’t available to them.    He’s right, it is shameful.  No one should be dying in hospital under these circumstances.    As a palliative care consultant and Chief Medical Officer for Marie Curie, the UK’s leading end of life charity, I know it doesn’t have to be this way.    Across the UK, initiatives set up by Marie Curie are working to stop this happening.   In Bradford, responding to data suggesting there are around 1,000 people with palliative care needs not accessing services, the Responsive Emergency Assessment and Community Team (REACT) has been set up to support patients in the last year of their life, particularly those who often end up in A&E in crisis.  The service is a partnership between Marie Curie, Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and Social Finance with social investment from Macmillan Cancer Support and Big Society Capital and grant funding from The National Lottery Community Fund.   In its first year, REACT supported more than 400 patients, drastically reducing the average number of days patients in the last year of their life would normally spend in hospital from 38 days to 17 days.    In Plymouth, currently only 20% of people are dying at home, compared with 29% in Devon as a whole and 28.4% in England.  To help stop people dying in hospital when they don’t necessarily need or want to be there, last year Marie Curie launched a new partnership with University Hospitals Plymouth NHS Trust.     This has included providing Marie Curie Healthcare Assistants to support the Emergency Department at Derriford Hospital.  These staff are working in partnership with an end of life care practitioner to help get patients home if this is where they want to be.     Marie Curie Nurses also support the identification of people who are approaching the end of their lives across the wider hospital, assess their needs and, in line with their wishes, support their transfer or discharge to their preferred place of care in a timely manner.   The team talk with patients and families about their preferences for where they would like to receive their care at end of life.    University Hospitals Plymouth has also expanded the number of dedicated beds available at Mount Gould Hospital, a local community hospital, for people nearing the end of their lives, with Marie Curie Nurses and Healthcare Assistants providing additional hands on-care and expertise.    These initiatives are making an enormous difference. But it isn’t enough. Currently 90% of people who die need palliative care but an estimated one in four people miss out.   This equates to around 150,000 people.   What’s even more shocking is that there is currently no national palliative care strategy in place to create the real change that is so urgently needed.     After the assisted dying debate gripped the nation, it’s clear that how we die is incredibly important and affects us all.  And, as we see A&E departments buckling under winter pressures this week and ambulance handover delays hitting record highs, we must not underestimate the importance of end of life care in this discussion.  Ensuring robust, effective and compassionate palliative care is in place is key if we want to reduce the amount of people being taken to A&E and give dying people the peaceful and dignified deaths they deserve.    If the government is to realise its ambition for more healthcare to be provided in the community rather than in hospital, so that patients and their families receive personalised care in the most appropriate setting, then palliative and end of life care needs to be at the heart of its plans to build an NHS fit for the future.    As the government prepares the NHS 10 Year Health Plan, palliative and end of life care must be prioritised.   We need a national palliative care strategy, we need long term transformational funding and we need to close the gap in end of life care. ________________ Dr Sarah Holmes, Palliative Care Consultant and Chief Medical Officer at Marie Curie.

      "A glass of milk a day can cut the risk of bowel cancer by almost a fifth, a UK wide study shows\n",
      "The calcium in a glass of milk provides enough calcium to protect from bowel cancer. The study monitored the diets of over half a million women over 16 years, and found that milk, dark leafy greens and bread contained enough calcium to protect the bowel. The study, by Oxford University and Cancer Research UK, found that a large glass of milk lowers your risk by 17%. The lead researcher, Dr Keren Papier, said to The Independent: “This is the most comprehensive single study ever conducted into the relationship between diet and bowel cancer, and it highlights the protective role of calcium in the development of this disease.” The research noted that your extra calcium intake does not have to be a glass of milk - but milk in tea or coffee, yoghurt and vegetables still counts. They also found that drinking too much alcohol and consuming processed meat increases the risk of the disease. A medium glass of wine or a pint of beer increases risk of bowel cancer by 15%. The research suggests that the calcium in milk protects the bowels by binding to bile acids and freeing fatty acids, cutting the possibility of developing cancer.

Symptoms of bowel cancer include a change in bowel movements (loser stool or constipation), bleeding, unexplained weight loss, or unexplained fatigue.\n",

      "Warnings have been issued in Plymouth, Hampshire, Birmingham and on Merseyside and some patients have had to wait up to 50 hours to be seen. Shelagh gave Streeting a challenge, saying \"if in four years, 80 year olds are still waiting on floors or trollies in hospitals, it's safe to say you have failed\". Mr Streeting agreed, telling Shelagh that \"we are taking people in ambulances to die.\" Mr Streeting said he is determined to \"save the NHS that saved my life and to build the national care service this country deserves\". He also stated that if the government doesn’t achieve their  \"ambitious\" targets for the NHS it’s \"my head on the chopping block\" It's been a turbulent start to the year for Labour ministers so far, and the NHS is struggling again amid a spike in seasonal viruses. And it comes after polling carried out for LBC revealed that one in four voters who backed Labour last year now regrets it. When asked by LBC's Shelagh Fogarty if what’s going on in the UK's A&Es is a national emergency, Mr Streeting said the NHS is \"broken, not beaten\". He added he was \"extremely forthright\" at the start of his tenure as Health Secretary and attracted some criticism for his comments. Mr Streeting then said there are more more beds taken up with flu at the moment than usual, but that \"annual winter pressures should not lead to an annual winter crisis\". Over the Christmas period, Mr Streeting stated he \"popped into the Derriford hospital in Plymouth to look at the A&E there. He said that it \"pops up every winter crisis\" because they have particular challenges - despite staff's efforts and a \"great new chief executive\". He added: \"I am never going to pretend that when there are problems that everything is alright. I will do everything I can to make sure that we see consistent improvement.. it is going to take time. \"I feel genuinely distressed and ashamed about some off the things that patients are experiencing.\" When probed on a plan for A&E and ambulance services, Mr Streeting said they will shortly publish an emergency care reform plan and are looking at this winter to plan for the next.

The challenges are enormous but we’re going \"hell for leather\", he added. Streeting saaid Labour are \"making unpopular decisions because ‘we’ve got to get this country out of a hole\". But he urged listeners to give the government \"the benefit of the doubt\". Liverpool University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust has declared a \"critical incident\" due to \"exceptionally high demand\" on services and urged people to only go to A&E in a genuine medical emergency. The hospital said it was \"extremely busy\" amid a rising number of patients with flu and other respiratory conditions, prompting Liverpool Riverside Labour MP Kim Johnson to call on the government to come up with a plan to increase NHS funding. Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust also said there was a \"critical incident\" at Basingstoke and Winchester hospitals due to \"sustained pressures\" while University Hospitals Plymouth NHS Trust also declared a critical incident because of \"significant and rising demand for hospital care\". The East Midlands Ambulance Service - which covers Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Rutland, Northamptonshire and Lincolnshire - has declared the first critical incident in its history due to a combination of \"significant patient demand, pressure within hospitals and flooding\".\n",

      "Bianca Perea was diagnosed with the most advanced kind of bowel cancer in November 2021. Despite doctors telling her they aimed to prolong her life rather than find a cure, the trainee lawyer from Manchester refused to accept this was the only option. \"I don't want to sound kind of ignorant or arrogant or anything like that but I just didn't feel in my gut that that was going to be it,\" she said. And following other treatments, including targeted drug therapy, chemotherapy and surgery, the transplant was a huge success and Ms Perea now has no signs of cancer anywhere in her body. Ms Perea first visited her GP in Wigan after feeling constipated and bloated and was referred to her local hospital, where high levels of blood were discovered in her stool. After tests, a colonoscopy and a biopsy, she was diagnosed with stage four bowel cancer, which had spread to all eight segments of her liver. Her mother asked about a possible transplant at that stage but was told it was not a feasible treatment. Ms Perea was referred to Christie NHS Foundation Trust’s local treatment centre in December that year, where she underwent 37 rounds of a targeted drug called panitumumab alongside chemotherapy for two and a half years. She had an excellent response to the treatment, which meant she was able to have an operation in May 2023 to remove the bowel tumour. But scans showed she still had tumours in her liver, which could not be operated on. However, after responding so well to chemotherapy and with her bowel cancer was seemingly gone, doctors considered a liver transplant. Ms Perea was added to the transplant list in February 2024 and was fortunate enough to find a donor last summer before having the operation at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust. She said: \"Within four weeks of going under the knife, I was able to drive and walk the family dogs, it was really quite incredible. \"To go from being told I'd only have a short time to live to now being cancer-free is the greatest gift. \"I've been given a second chance at life and I'm going to grab it with both hands. I am so grateful to the family who agreed to donate their loved one's liver. \"I do believe this is a cure. They're always hesitant to say that, obviously, but I am cancer-free right now.\" Ms Perea is now looking forward to going on holiday and is working on improving her fitness. \"My liver is doing really well,\" she said. \"I get tests on that, and I've just had my second scan and that's all clear, so it's really good.\" Read more: Starmer unveils plans to reform NHS as he pledges to slash waiting times Read more: Six-month old baby killed after horror crash in multi-storey car park - as man charged with causing death by dangerous driving  Dr Kalena Marti, Ms Perea's oncologist, said: \"To see that Bianca has had such a positive outcome is wonderful. \"When we looked at the tumour cells in her liver after it had been removed, they weren't active. \"This is excellent news, and we hope that this means that the cancer won't come back.\" Dr Ian Rowe, honorary consultant hepatologist at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, said: “We are, of course, indebted to the family of the organ donor – as is made clear with Bianca’s case, organ donation saves lives. “It is important that people register their decision to donate on the NHS organ donor register and make their decision known to their loved ones. Families will always be consulted on any decisions around organ donation.”\n",

      "People who drink plant-based milk alternatives such as soy or oat could be at a higher risk of depression, a study has found. \n",
      "\n",
      "But drinkers of semi-skimmed dairy products are at a lower risk of both anxiety and depression, experts suggested.  Over 350,000 people signed up to the study by UK Biobank.  Those who enrolled were monitored for over 10 years, with researchers keeping an eye out for mental health changes.  It was found that people who drink semi-skimmed milk were12% less likely to have depression and 10% less likely to be anxious when taking in age, physical health and income into account.  Skimmed milk was found to have no positive impacts, although consuming milks with no dairy were linked to a 14% increased risk in developing depression.  This may be because dairy-based milk is a rich source of calcium, which has been shown to activate pathways in the body that can boost serotonin production. Read more: Smartwatch technology could help people quit smoking, study finds Read more: Research reveals size of ‘Christmas hamper’ for retirees on different incomes High levels of serotonin in the brain has been found to help stave off depression, while low amounts of the chemical results in low moods. Commonly used antidepressants, known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), are aimed at ramping up levels of the chemical in the brain. The study authors, from the Southern Medical University, wrote: “Milk is a rich source of nutrients such as lactose, lipids, protein, and minerals, which are essential for maintaining human health.” Meanwhile, semi-skimmed milk has a particular fatty-acid profile that “might provide greater cerebral protection compared to full cream milk and skimmed milk”, the authors added. This potentially reduces the risk of both depression and anxiety, they said.  The authors added: “The analysis indicates the possibility of an inverse association between the consumption of semi-skimmed milk and the risks of depression and anxiety.“ These findings suggest that semi-skimmed milk may have a protective effect against these mental health conditions, presenting new prospects for dietary interventions.” The research was published in the journal Frontiers in Nutrition. However, plant-based milks are sometimes fortified with vitamins and minerals, such as ​​ calcium, vitamin B12 and iodine, which can benefit those who avoid dairy or animal products or are at risk of deficiency.  Retail sales of dairy and dairy alternatives to milk and cream reached £5.71 billion in the UK in 2024, according to Mintel. The average price of a liter of semi-skimmed milk was 79 pence per liter in the Britain in the 52 in the 52 weeks ending on November 30, 2024, research published by Statista showed. Meanwhile, plant-based alternatives cost over £1.4.\n",

      "Sir Keir Starmer has outlined details of his plan to cut NHS waiting times in England from 18 months to 18 weeks over the next five years.\n",
      "In his first major speech of 2025, the prime minister laid out how greater use of the private sector will help deliver up to half a million more appointments. Meanwhile, up to a million appointments could be freed up by giving patients the choice to go without follow-up appointments currently booked by default, according to the government. The aim of the reforms is that by the end of March 2026, an extra 450,000 patients will be treated within the target time of 18 weeks. The waiting list currently stands at 7.5 million with four in 10 already having waited longer than 18 weeks. Doctors leaders welcomed the plan, but expressed concern whether there was enough staff to achieve the goals being set. Speaking at a hospital in Surrey, Sir Keir said: \"The feeling of record dissatisfaction that we now see. Millions of people waiting, waiting, waiting on waiting lists, their lives on hold. The potential of the country blocked. \"So 2025 is about rebuilding Britain and rebuilding our NHS is the cornerstone of that.\" He added: \"To catapult the service into the future, we need an NHS that is reformed from top to bottom, millions of extra appointments signed, sealed and delivered with the plan that we are launching here today. \"National renewal in action.\" Read more: Starmer slams 'desperate' Elon Musk for spreading 'lies' and 'whipping up intimidation' Read more: Quarter of voters regret backing Sir Keir Starmer and winter fuel axe ‘worse than Partygate’, poll for LBC shows Sir Keir said the NHS must be “hungry for innovation” but reiterated his belief that the health service cannot become a “national money pit”. He said: “Productivity can’t (be) 11% lower than it was before the pandemic. “Working people can’t be expected to subsidise the current levels of care with ever-rising taxes. That is the price of ducking reform, and I won’t stand for it. “I believe in public service. I believe in the NHS. I’ll fight for it day and night. I’ll never stand for that.” A network of Community Diagnostic Centres will extend their opening hours to 12 hours a day, seven days a week and will provide appointments such as scans and endoscopies in local neighbourhoods. The aim is to get patients treated more quickly, closer to home and without relying on hospitals. GPs will also be able, where appropriate, to refer patients directly to these centres without requiring a prior consultation with a specialist doctor. More surgical hubs also will be created to focus on common, less complex procedures, such as cataract surgeries and some orthopaedic work. On expanding use of the private sector, Sir Keir acknowledged \"some would not like this\". But he added: \"I'm not interested in putting ideology before patients.\" Figures published by NHS England last month showed an estimated 7.54 million treatments were waiting to be carried out at the end of October - the lowest figure since March 2024. According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, the last time the NHS met the target of 92% of patients receiving treatment within 18 weeks was in 2015. The reforms for England will also see an overhaul of the NHS app to give patients greater choice over where they choose to have their appointment and will also provide greater detail to the patient including their results and waiting times. The first step in the digital overhaul will be completed by March 2025, when patients at over 85% of acute trusts will be able to view their appointment details via the NHS app, the government said. They'll also be able to contact their provider and receive updates, including how long they are likely to wait for treatment. Sir Keir said the NHS must deliver convenience for patients, just as people can book holidays and find love online. “Just think about it – every day, just a few swipes of their phone, millions of people buy food or clothes for themselves and their family, they book holidays, they even find love. “There is no reason, no good reason, why a public, free-at-the-point-of-use NHS can’t deliver that kind of convenience. In fact, it must.”\n",

      "\n",
      "Patients will be able to be directly referred and booked in for tests, checks and scans by their GP for a multiple of conditions under plans set to be launched by the NHS and government next week. People with conditions including breathlessness, asthma in children and young people, and post-menopausal bleeding will no longer need to see a consultant before receiving tests.  The Elective Reform Plan could see millions of people receive a diagnosis weeks earlier.  It comes as NHS chiefs pledge to improve patient experience and end the significant delays between GP referrals and hospital appointments. Health bosses say routine care could be delivered to nine in ten patients within 18 weeks under the plans. Read more: NHS giving asylum seekers priority care to 'address inequalities' as waiting lists pile up Read more: Government says social care reform may not be delivered until 2028 as charities say waiting is ‘not an option’ Meanwhile, thousands of extra Brits could get diagnosed and receive treatment within a single day. NHS's Chief Executive, Amanda Pritchard, said: “While there are too many people waiting unacceptably long for care, NHS staff have made huge progress in bringing down long waits since the pandemic.  \"And backed by government investment, alongside our commitment to continue to reform and innovate, we know that staff can significantly reduce waiting times across the country again.” Ms Pritchard added that there are currently one in nine people in England on waiting lists, admitting there is “more we can do to support those who are waiting for crucial tests and procedures”.  She continued: “By making it easier for people to get timely access to the tests they need alongside direct referrals and same day checks and consultations – this plan will help thousands more people to get a faster diagnosis and quicker treatment or the all clear, so people can get back to living their lives as soon as possible, with peace of mind that they won’t need further treatment.” Health secretary Wes Streeting has said the plans will free up the NHS to treat more patients and “cut waiting lists from a maximum of 18 months to 18 weeks by the end of this Parliament.” He added: “As patients, we’ve all experienced the hoops you have to jump through to get the test or scan you and your GP know you need.  “It’s a waste of patients’ time, delays diagnoses when every minute matters, and means consultants are forced to tick boxes rather than treat patients.” This comes as up to six million Brits are currently waiting to receive care. In some cases it can take up to 18 weeks for them to see a GP. In October, Mr Streeting told LBC he had the funds to \"start turning the NHS around\" as he defended Labour's spending plans ahead of the Autumn Budget. He told Nick Ferrari: “The chancellor has prioritised the NHS to root out waste and inefficiency.  \"All of our manifesto commitments, despite the challenges we’ve got, stand today,\" he said, adding: \"I owe it to taxpayers that their money is well spent.\" Chancellor Rachel Reeves later announced a £22.6billion boost in the NHS’s day-to-day health budget and a £3.1 billion increase in the capital budget over this year and next. During his general election campaign, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer vowed to focus on reducing treatment backlogs and create an additional 40,000 appointments, scans and operations each week during evenings and weekends.\n",

      "\n",
      "Up to six million Brits are currently waiting to receive care. In some cases it can take up to 18 weeks for them to see a GP. But a special category of patients needing an “urgent” assessment can ask for an appointment at A&E under a scheme known as 987 Inclusion Health. Those in this category include undocumented migrants. Under the scheme, they can be pushed up the queue when they arrive at hospital and taken straight to a consultant for further evaluation. The scheme is aimed at patients who might otherwise find it difficult to attend A&E due to the long delays waiting to be seen. It is in place across University College London Hospitals (UCLH). Read more: NHS Cornwall declares critical incident as flu cases quadruple and experts warn of 'dangerous' weekend ahead Read more: Don't go outside, NHS warns as Brits brace for three days of snow and temperatures set to plummet to -10C As well as undocumented migrants, members of the public who are homeless, use or have used class A drugs, and struggle with persistent alcohol misuse, are also eligible. It is just one of multiple initiatives that have been rolled out across the UK offering migrants faster access to healthcare. At a Stoke-on-Trent hospital, a team of NHS staff has been set up to “help failed asylum seekers, many of whom are homeless and destitute with no recourse to public funds”, The Telegraph reports. These services have reportedly been made available due to as experts say migrants would be unlikely to sign up to doctors or dentists surgeries due to a lack of understanding with how the system works even though they are entitled to register with GPs and receive free primary care services in England, Wales and Scotland.  The same goes for all other patients no matter what their immigration status is. NHS England has argued that its priority schemes will help the government meet its target of slashing health inequality and improving life expectancy by 2035. A spokesperson told The Telegraph that vulnerable migrants and refugees make up significant parts of its “inclusion health groups”. They added that the NHS was “legally required to provide healthcare services to asylum seekers and migrants which are free at the point of use”, saying it has “a legal duty to address inequalities in access to NHS services”. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said during his general election campaign that he wants to create an NHS that is \"there for everyone\". He vowed to focus on reducing treatment backlogs and create an additional 40,000 appointments, scans and operations each week during evenings and weekends. Meanwhile in August, the numbers of migrants successfully claiming asylum reached the highest levels since records began, according to Home Office statistics. Figures showed 67,978 asylum seekers were granted refugee status in the year to June - more than three times the amount in the year prior when 21,436 claims were granted. Last month, LBC reported that hundreds of desperate asylum seekers are trying to “escape” the UK for France beneath lorries and on makeshift rafts after being left in limbo by British authorities. A French interior ministry source said the authorities have been battling a new wave of “reverse migration”, with 300 people entering France illegally from the UK in the last year alone. The true number, however, could be far higher as this figure only includes those who were discovered by authorities.The Home Office admitted it did not know how many people were leaving the UK for third countries illegally each year.\n",

      "NHS bosses in Cornwall have declared a critical incident as the county’s health services face ‘significant pressure’.\n",
      "The critical incident was declared as the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro is experiencing long ambulance queues outside and high patient numbers in its emergency department. NHS executives are now urging people to avoid coming to A&E if they do not have a life or limb-threatening injury. Kate Shields, chief executive of NHS Cornwall and Isles of Scilly integrated care board said: \"We urgently need the public's support to make sure we can see those who are sickest and have the greatest need. \"Please only come to the emergency department if you have a life or limb-threatening emergency.\" Ms Shields urged the public to help by using alternative services, including minor injury units, urgent treatment centres, pharmacies and NHS 111. The NHS advises anyone unwell with flu, norovirus, or Covid-19 to stay at home, rest and hydrate. According to NHS data, the number of people in hospital in England is rising at a \"very concerning rate\" and is more than four times the level it was a month ago. An average of 4,469 flu patients were in beds in England each day last week, compared to just under 1,100 on December 1. The number of people in critical care for flu is also rising, having increased by 17 per cent last week compared to the previous week. Professor Julian Redhead, NHS clinical director for urgent and emergency care, said: “These latest figures show the pressure from flu was nowhere near letting up before we headed into the new year, skyrocketing to over 5,000 cases a day in hospital as of the end of last week and rising at a very concerning rate. Read More: Government says social care reform may not be delivered until 2028 as charities say waiting is ‘not an option’ Read More: Don't go outside, NHS warns as Brits brace for three days of snow and temperatures set to plummet to -10C “With what looks like an extreme cold snap expected right across England ahead of the weekend, we know the low temperatures can be dangerous for those who are vulnerable or have respiratory conditions. Declaring a critical incident enables the NHS to create capacity, expedite patient discharges, relieve emergency department pressure and free up ambulances and their crews for urgent care. Professor Redhead added: “the number of hospital beds in England filled by patients with norovirus-like symptoms was an average of 538 per day last week - down slightly from the week before, but much higher than the average from this time last year, which was 377. \"The average number of children with RSV and beds occupied by Covid patients last week is also slightly down on the week before.” Earlier on Friday, a Surrey Hospital warned people to only attend in cases of a \"life-threatening emergency\" after a critical incident was declared following the spread of winter viruses. East Surrey Hospital has asked the public to use alternative NHS services, including non-emergency number 111, local pharmacies, GPs, as well as urgent treatment centres in a bid to prioritise the most severely ill patients. The move was made to ensure emergency care is available for the most seriously ill patients.It comes after the NHS warned it is \"busier than ever before\" this winter, warning of a \"quad-demic\" situation involving four of the most common winter viruses - influenza virus, RSV, coronavirus and norovirus. Those who are eligible, and NHS staff, are being urged to get vaccinations without delay as virus levels rise and pressure remains on the country's hospitals. Professor Redhead added: “On top of flu there is also continual pressure from Covid, while RSV and norovirus hospital cases are also higher than last year, with hospitals putting in place an extra 1,300 beds last week than the same time last year in expectation of this continued pressure from viruses and other demand.\" The NHS has also issued an urgent warning for people to stay indoors the next few days as the UK is set to face three days of snow and temperatures of -10C. Doctors are telling vulnerable people to stay inside early in the day or late in the evening and to stock up on food and medicine ahead of the icy weather this weekend. Temperatures could fall as low as minus 8C on Thursday night as wintry conditions are expected to continue for at least a week. Dr Ananta Dave, Chief Medical Officer for NHS Black Country Integrated Care Board, said: “With more cold weather predicted over the next week, it’s important that everyone stays warm and continues to look out for those more vulnerable to the cold conditions. “Cold weather can seriously affect your health, particularly for the elderly and very young children. As well as physical injuries from the increase in slips and falls due to the icy conditions, the drop in temperature can also affect your immune system. “That’s why it’s also important that those with long-term conditions, such as heart disease, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and diabetes, take care of themselves in the cold weather as it can make some health problems worse.\"\n",

It comes amid the spread of common winter viruses - including Norovirus, the winter vomiting bug - with Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust declaring the 'critical incident' on Thursday. The move was made to ensure emergency care is available for the most seriously ill patients. A spokesperson for the hospital said on Thursday: “Our staff are working around the clock to minimise disruption to those already on our wards, treat all patients coming into our Emergency Department, and continue to discharge patients who no longer require acute care to ensure we have available beds for those who need admission, but please only attend East Surrey Hospital in a life-threatening emergency. “If your condition isn’t life-threatening, please utilise other NHS services such as 111 online, your local pharmacy or GP, as well as nearby treatment centres at Crawley, Caterham Dene, Horsham and East Grinstead.  \"This will help ensure emergency care is available to patients who need it most.” Visitors to the hospital are also being asked to follow tight infection control measures in an attempt curb the spread of common winter viruses.

      "There were over 340 calls waiting to be answered when the incident was declared. More than half of the Trust's ambulance vehicles were waiting outside hospitals to hand over patients. Many were left waiting for “hours”.  Jason Killens, the Welsh Ambulance Service's chief executive, has asked for the public’s cooperation as the service grapples with the surge in demand.  He said: “People out celebrating can help us tonight by of course, having a good time, but drinking sensibly, eating before they go out and looking after their friends.” Mr Killens said the increased demand has come as a “result of flu and COVID and other respiratory viruses circulating through the winter.\" \"What we have seen in the last 24 to 48 hours is an acute accumulation of those pressures,\" he added.

      "A baby’s father and a coroner have called for action after a six-week-old baby boy died in a sling as he was being breastfed.\n",
      "James Alderman, known as Jimmy, was being breastfed in a baby carrier worn by his mother while she moved around their home. Jimmy's inquest heard he was in an unsafe position too far down the sling, and after five minutes he had collapsed. Resuscitation was started straight away but he died three days later on October 11, 2023. The baby’s father, George Alderman, has called for the introduction of a mandatory standardised test for carriers to help save other babies’ lives. Speaking to Sky News, Mr Alderman said: \"Baby slings are sold as being a lifesaver, allowing you to get on with your business while your baby's safe and close to you, but in this instance, we had our baby close, but not safe.\" Mr Alderman said most of the advice given to parents using slings focuses on them being too tight, while few are made aware of the danger of having the sling too loose, which allows babies to slump. Explaining the explanations he got from medical experts about Jimmy’s death, he said: \"After he'd been feeding, he fell asleep and then he slumped forwards. \"Then, because his head was covered and he had his chin against his chest, he was facing downwards. \"Nothing was covering his face, but because of the position he was in, that meant that not enough oxygen was going into his lungs because he was small and not fully developed, and that's why he stopped breathing.\" Read more: More than 89,000 stillborn babies buried in mass graves across England as parents search for childrens' remains Read more: Ant McPartlin's ex-wife shares happy baby news just months after TV star became father for first time The so-called \"baby-wearing\" phenomenon is believed by some to help bonding between mother and baby because of their close proximity. A coroner has also issued a warning about the dangers of baby slings after the six-week-old boy died, saying there is \"very little\" safety information available to parents, despite a \"significant increase\" in their use over recent years. Lydia Brown, senior coroner for west London, said there appeared to be \"no advice that breastfeeding hands-free a young baby is unsafe due to the risk of suffocation\", and called for industry standards promoting the safe use of slings. \"There appeared to be no helpful visual images of 'safe' versus 'unsafe' sling/carrier postures,\" she said, adding that \"the NHS available literature provides no guidance or advice\". \"In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths.\" Mr Alderman has also called for changes to the industry, saying there should be a standardised mandatory test for slings and carriers. The regulation of these products is voluntary in the UK, meaning companies have their own methods of testing them, which can vary in effectiveness. He said: \"Some use weighted dolls, some use bags of sand. How a bag of sand can accurately represent a baby, I just don't know.” Copies of the coroner's Prevention of Future Deaths Report were sent to sling manufacturer Beco, as well as the NHS and the Department of Health and Social Care. The Lullaby Trust, a charity providing expert advice on safer sleep for babies, said the risk appears to be greatest \"when a baby's airway is obstructed either by their chin resting on their chest or their mouth and nose being covered by a parent's skin or clothing\". \"The safest baby carrier to use will keep the infant firmly in an upright position where a parent can always see their baby's face, and ensure their airways are free.\" A Government spokesperson said: \"Our thoughts are with James's family at this difficult time. We will ensure that the concerns raised in the coroner's report are carefully considered and that appropriate action is taken where necessary. \"Our product safety laws demand that manufacturers make sure their products are safe and clear instructions are included on how to use them safely. If products are found to be unsafe, the Office for Product Safety and Standards has the power to take enforcement action.\"\n",

      "Smokers have been urged to kick the habit as they enter the new year after new analysis reveals the time lost by each cigarette smoked. \n",
      "The new stats reveal that men lose approximately 17 minutes of life with every cigarette smoked, while a woman's life is cut short by 22 minutes for each cigarette experts have revealed. This figure surpasses previous estimates, which suggested that each cigarette shortens a smoker's life by 11 minutes. The new estimates, which suggest that each cigarette leads to 20 minutes loss of live on average across both genders, are based on more up-to-date figures from long-term studies tracking the health of the population. Researchers from University College London said that the harm caused by smoking is \"cumulative\" and the sooner a person stops smoking, and the more cigarettes they avoid smoking, the longer they live. The new analysis, commissioned by the Department for Health and Social Care, suggests that if a 10-cigarettes-a-day smoker quits on January 1, then by January 8 they could \"prevent loss of a full day of life\". By February 20, their lives could be extended by a whole week. And if their quitting is successful until August 5, they will likely live for a whole month longer than if they had continued to smoke. The authors added: \"Studies suggest that smokers typically lose about the same number of healthy years as they do total years of life. \"Thus smoking primarily eats into the relatively healthy middle years rather than shortening the period at the end of life, which is often marked by chronic illness or disability. \"So a 60-year-old smoker will typically have the health profile of a 70-year-old non-smoker.\" Read more: The King and Prime Minister pay condolences to 179 victims of South Korea plane crash Read more: British teen, 18, 'surrenders' to Dubai authorities to begin one-year sentence after 'holiday romance’ with London girl, 17 The analysis, to be published in the Journal of Addiction, concludes: \"We estimate that on average, smokers in Britain who do not quit lose approximately 20 minutes of life expectancy for each cigarette they smoke. \"This is time that would likely be spent in relatively good health. \"Stopping smoking at every age is beneficial but the sooner smokers get off this escalator of death the longer and healthier they can expect their lives to be.\" Dr Sarah Jackson, principal research fellow from the UCL Alcohol and Tobacco Research Group, said: \"It is vital that people understand just how harmful smoking is and how much quitting can improve their health and life expectancy. \"The evidence suggests people lose, on average, around 20 minutes of life for each cigarette they smoke. \"The sooner a person stops smoking, the longer they live. \t\"Quitting at any age substantially improves health and the benefits start almost immediately. \"It's never too late to make a positive change for your health and there are a range of effective products and treatments that can help smokers quit for good.\" Health officials have said that smokers can find advice, support and resources with the NHS Quit Smoking app, as well as the online Personal Quit Plan. Public health minister Andrew Gwynne said: \"Smoking is an expensive and deadly habit and these findings reveal the shocking reality of this addiction, highlighting how important it is to quit. \t\"The new year offers a perfect chance for smokers to make a new resolution and take that step.\" Commenting on the paper, Professor Sanjay Agrawal, special adviser on tobacco at the Royal College of Physicians, said: \"Every cigarette smoked costs precious minutes of life, and the cumulative impact is devastating, not only for individuals but also for our healthcare system and economy. \"This research is a powerful reminder of the urgent need to address cigarette smoking as the leading preventable cause of death and disease in the UK.\"\n",

      "ONS figures highlighted by the Liberal Democrats showed that 12.2% of people in England do not have a dentist at all, and only 52.8% have an NHS dentist. Analysis found that in one month alone 140,526 (94.1%) people, who needed treatment but did not have their own dentist, were unable to access NHS dental care.

This is fuelling fears that more and more patients are resorting to DIY dentistry due to not being able to access any form of affordable dental care. In Oswestry, North Shropshire, where one practice recently handed back its NHS contract due to not being able to balance its books, a man pulled his own tooth out with pliers after six months in agony not being able to find an NHS dentist. As part of the release of the figures, the Liberal Democrats called on the government to end the scourge of dental deserts and to back their Dental Rescue Package. This includes measures such as bringing dentists back to the NHS from the private sector by fixing the broken NHS dental contract and introducing an emergency scheme to guarantee access to free NHS dental check-ups for those already eligible: children, new mothers, those who are pregnant and those on low incomes. Liberal Democrat Health and Social Care spokesperson, Helen Morgan MP said: “As more and more patients are forced to perform dangerous DIY dentistry, it’s like pulling teeth trying to get ministers to take the action we need. “The crisis in NHS dentistry cannot be allowed to continue - the government must act urgently to bring dentistry back from the brink. “The new government must not repeat the mistakes of the Conservatives that created swathes of dental deserts up and down the country. “The Liberal Democrats have a comprehensive Dental Rescue Package that must be introduced as soon as possible so that patients can access the NHS care they need.”\n",

      "A groundbreaking new AI tool could help thousands of people who aren’t aware they are living with atrial fibrillation, a heart condition which could lead to deadly strokes, by detecting it before symptoms arise.\n",
      "A new artificial intelligence tool is finding people with a heart condition before they even have symptoms. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a heart condition that causes an irregular and often abnormally fast heart rate, and people with it have a significantly higher risk of having a stroke. Around 1.6 million people across the UK have been diagnosed with AF. But leading heart charity the British Heart Foundation (BHF) said there are likely many thousands of undiagnosed people in the UK who don’t even know they're living with the condition. For some, AF can lead to heart palpitations, dizziness, shortness of breath and tiredness. But others have no symptoms of the condition and the affected person is completely unaware that their heart rate is irregular. When AF is identified and treated early it can be managed and the stroke risk reduced. This is where the new ground-breaking tool tries to help, by scouring GP records to look for \"red flags\" which could indicate whether a patient is at risk of developing the condition. One former Army captain who took part in the trial said he is \"really grateful\" that his AF was detected. John Pengelly, a retired grandfather, was diagnosed with AF earlier this year after taking part in the Find-AF trial, and now just takes a \"couple of pills a day\" to reduce his heightened risk of a deadly stroke. \"I got a letter inviting me to take part in the study and I thought if it benefits somebody then great, I want to help,\" he said. Read more: 'Hoping for a Christmas miracle': Children waiting months for life-saving procedures as all NHS beds full Read more: Workplace health checks to be introduced in England to help spot deadly diseases early After the algorithm identified that Mr Pengelly was at a higher risk, he was sent an at-home ECG. \"They sent me a little digital monitor and a few times a day I had to put my thumbs on it so it could take a reading, which took about two minutes. \"Then I pressed send and the reading went to the trial team. I did that for a few weeks, and I sent the kit back - it was really straightforward. \"I was diagnosed with AF a few weeks after that. I'd heard of it, but you never think that these things will happen to you.” The 74-year-old, from Apperley Bridge, Bradford in West Yorkshire, spent 29 years in the Army Catering Corps before he retired. \"I didn't have any symptoms. I'd occasionally get a bit breathless when I'm out and about, but that's because there are so many hills around us and some of them are really steep. \"I'm really grateful it has been picked up. I now take a couple of pills every day to reduce my risk of having a stroke. \"It's just a few pills every day that will hopefully keep me going for a good few more years yet.\" The algorithm was developed by scientists and clinicians at the University of Leeds and Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, with funding from the BHF. They created the tool using anonymised electronic health records of over 2.1 million people, training the algorithm to find warning signs that could indicate a person is at risk of developing AF. The tool was validated with medical records from a further 10 million people. Experts are assessing how effective it is at finding people who are at risk of developing AF in the next six months, with those identified then offered further testing. It works out someone's risk based on a number of factors including age, sex, ethnicity and whether or not they have other medical conditions including heart failure, high blood pressure, diabetes, ischaemic heart disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. If people involved in the study are identified as high risk they will be offered a handheld electrocardiography (ECG) machine to measure their heart rhythm. If the ECG machine readings indicate that a patient has AF, their GP is informed and they can discuss treatment options. Experts hope that the preliminary West Yorkshire study will pave the way for a UK-wide trial, which would hopefully prevent a number of avoidable strokes. Estimates suggest that AF is a contributing factor in around 20,000 strokes every year in the UK. Chris Gale, professor of cardiovascular medicine at the University of Leeds and honorary consultant cardiologist at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, said: \"All too often the first sign that someone is living with undiagnosed atrial fibrillation is a stroke. \"This can be devastating for patients and their families, changing their lives in an instant. \"It also has major cost implications for health and social care services - costs which could have been avoided if the condition were spotted and treated earlier.\" Dr Sonya Babu-Narayan, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation and consultant cardiologist at Royal Brompton Hospital, said: \"We have effective treatments for people with atrial fibrillation who are at high risk of having a stroke. \"But right now some people are missing out because they don't know that they may be living with this hidden threat to their health. \"By harnessing the power of routinely collected health care data and prediction algorithms, this research offers a real opportunity to identify more people who are at risk of atrial fibrillation and who may benefit from treatment to reduce their risk of a devastating stroke.\" It comes as NHS officials said that the service has hit a milestone in stroke prevention. Five years ago, the NHS in England set the ambition to increase the number of patients with AF on medication which prevents blood clots from 84% to 90% within 10 years. NHS England said the latest figures show that 92% of people who have been diagnosed with AF have been prescribed the potentially lifesaving treatment. As a result, it estimates that thousands of strokes have been prevented in the last five years.\n",

      "Emergency doctors have issued a safety warning over gifting children water beads at Christmas due to their choking hazard and other potentially fatal consequences.\n",
      "The brightly coloured plastic beads, often marketed as toys, are generally a few millimetres in size but can expand by up to 400 times in about 36 hours when exposed to liquid. If a child swallows one, they can cause bowel obstruction and the consequences can be fatal. They can also cause choking and have harmed children in the UK, with reports linking them to deaths overseas, the government's Office for Product Safety and Standards said in September. The Royal College of Emergency Medicine (RCEM) has advised that the beads should be kept well away from children aged under five. It said they should only be used by older children or vulnerable adults under close supervision.

The RCEM advised parents and carers to seek medical attention immediately if there is any suspicion a child may have swallowed a water bead. \"Having seen the effects first hand, which can be devastating and detrimental, we are asking people to please think twice about the dangers these pose while selecting and gifting presents this season,\" Dr Salwa Malik, vice president of the RCEM, told PA Media. The RCEM alert also highlights the potential danger to children and vulnerable adults of button or coin batteries and magnets, if swallowed.\n",

      "November figures from the health service revealed 499,068 people have received a dementia diagnosis - a jump of 19,416 in a year. Care minister Stephen Kinnock said a timely diagnosis is \"vital\" to ensure patients can access the care and support they need as early as possible. Common symptoms include forgetfulness, irritability, struggling to follow a conversation or find the right word and being confused about time and place, and the NHS is encouraging people to get checked if they experience any early signs.

She said: \"Around one million people are living with dementia in the UK. \"Christmas should be a happy time when families often get together. \"But sadly, for some people it will be the first time they notice changes in their loved ones showing signs of dementia. \"A third of people living with dementia in England don't have a diagnosis. \"Getting a diagnosis can be daunting but we believe it's better to know. \"An early and accurate diagnosis can open the door to vital care, support and treatment. \"It can also help people to manage their symptoms and avoid ending up in crisis. \"We welcome the drive to ensure more people get a dementia diagnosis and the lifechanging help they need.\" Dementia was the leading cause of death in the UK in 2023 - with 75,393 people dying from the disease last year, compared with 74,261 in the previous 12 months and 69,178 in 2021, according to Alzheimer's Research UK.\n",

      "\n",
      "Seven tourists on the island of Fiji were treated in hospital for suspected alcohol poisoning over the weekend. The tourists - aged between 18 and 56 - had been in a “critical condition” after drinking cocktails at a five-star resort. The group, including Australians and Americans, were staying at the five-star Warwick resort, near the town of Sigatoka on Saturday. They reportedly fell ill on Saturday night local time after drinking cocktails at a resort bar.

Local media has reported that four of the seven are Australian. Two people remain in the hospital, conscious and in stable condition, Fiji's Tourism Minister Viliame R Gavoka told reporters on Monday. One person was discharged on Sunday and four others on Monday. David Sandoe, an Australian man who said his daughter and granddaughter were hospitalised, told Sky News Australia on Monday his relatives had been cleared for discharge. Jemesa Tudravu, a Fiji Health Ministry spokesperson, said the incident was “nothing like” they’ve seen in recent memory. “The resort management has assured us that they have not engaged in practices such as substituting ingredients or altering the quality of drinks served to guests,\" he said. \"This is the only reported case of its kind that we've experienced in recent memory, and certainly nothing like this has been experienced this year,\" he added. The incident comes after a suspected mass methanol poisoning incident in Laos, South East Asia, where six tourists tragically died as a result. The tourists were reportedly given free shots as a show of hospitality by staff at Nana Backpackers Hostel. Methanol is a a deadly substance often present in homemade alcohol. Australian backpacker Holly Bowles, 19, had been in critical condition in a Bangkok hospital after she allegedly drank alcohol laced with the toxic chemical methanol. The teen died nine days later after attending Dr Yaher’s emergency room with her friend Bianca Jones, becoming the sixth tourist to pass away in connection to the contaminated alcohol. British lawyer Simone White, 28, an American man and two Danish tourists also died due to the suspected methanol poisoning in Laos. Local authorities in Laos have vowed to “bring the perpetrators to justice” as they said the tourist town was “deeply saddened” by the incident.“ The government of the Lao PDR is profoundly saddened over the loss of lives of foreign tourists in Vangvieng District, Vientiane Province and expresses its sincere sympathy and deepest condolences to the families of the deceased,' a police statement said.“ The government of the Lao PDR has been conducting investigations to find causes of the incident and to bring the perpetrators to justice in accordance with the law. \"The government of the Lao PDR reaffirms that it always attaches the importance and pays attention to the safety of both domestic and foreign tourists.”\n",

      "Delivering an address to Parliament on Tuesday, Sir Keir Starmer announced a boost in UK defence spending to 2.5 per cent of GDP by 2027. \n",
      "This bombshell announcement comes ahead of crucial talks with Donald Trump in Washington later this week.  Sir Keir said Britain should be proud of its support for Ukraine in the wake of Putin's invasion but must do more as tensions rise across Europe. To pay for this £13.4 billion defence hike, Labour will slash foreign aid, just one of the many \"hard choices\" Britain will face in the coming years, Starmer said.  \"Russia is a menace in our waters, in our airspace and on our streets,\" he told the Commons.  He added: \"We must find courage in our history, courage in who we are as a nation, because courage is what our own era now demands of us. Read more: UK should spend 3% of GDP on defence and could send up to 10,000 troops to Ukraine, Boris Johnson tells LBC \"So starting today, I can announce this Government will begin the biggest sustained increase in defence spending since the end of the Cold War. \"We will deliver our commitment to spend 2.5%. of GDP on defence, but we will bring it forward so that we reach that level in 2027, and we will maintain that for the rest of this Parliament. \"And let me spell it out, that means spending £13.4 billion more on defence every year from 2027.\" Even this is not far enough, Starmer continued as he pledged to raise spending to 3 per cent of GDP by the next Parliament.  \"At moments like these in our past Britain has stood up to be counted, it has come together and demonstrated strength. \"That is what the security of our country needs now and it is what we will deliver\" Starmer warned \"tyrants\" like Russian President Vladimir Putin \"only respond to strength\". He told MPs: \"We should not pretend that any of this has been easy. Working people have already felt the cost of Russian actions through rising prices and bills.  \"Nonetheless, one of the great lessons of our history is that instability in Europe will always wash up on our shores, and that tyrants like Putin only respond to strength. \"Russia is a menace in our waters, in our airspace and on our streets. They have launched cyber attacks on our NHS, only seven years ago a chemical weapons attack on the streets of Salisbury. \"We must stand by Ukraine, because if we do not achieve a lasting peace, then the economic instability are threats to our security, they will only grow. \"And so as the nature of that conflict changes, as it has in recent weeks, it brings our response into sharper focus, a new era that we must meet as we have so often in the past, together, and with strength.\" The British people may face hard choices to pay for this defence hike, the PM warned.  \"I equally want to be very clear that like any other investment we make, we must seek value for money and that's why we're putting in place a new defence, reform and efficiency plan, jointly led by my right honourable friends the Chancellor (Rachel Reeves) and the Defence Secretary (John Healey). \"This investment means that the UK will strengthen its position as a leader in Nato and in the collective defence of our continent, and we should welcome that role. \"It is good for our national security. It is also good for the defining mission of this Government - to restore growth to our economy.\" This bombshell commitment comes ahead of crucial talks with President Trump later this week.  The meeting is backdropped by rising tensions in Europe, with the US seemingly abandoning its commitments to NATO and Ukraine since Trump took office.  Tory leader Kemi Badenoch urged Sir Keir Starmer to avoid tax rises or borrowing more money to fund the defence budget. She told the Commons: \"Can the Prime Minister say in confidence that 2.5% by 2027 is sufficient because we need to look at exactly how we fund this. \"He must not raise taxes further as it will destroy our economy, we need a strong economy to pay for strong defence.  \t\"He cannot borrow more, we are already spending more on debt interest than defence. We all know that he must make difficult decisions on spending, he has our support to do that.\"\n",

      "Police said they were called to 32 Portland Place, known for notorious sex parties, at 7am on Sunday morning following reports of an assault. A group of men used knives to stab party-goers during the fight, according to The Sun. The mansion is where OnlyFans star Bonnie Blue recently slept with more than 1,000 men in 12 hours. A source told The Sun: “There was blood everywhere with people lying injured all over the place. “It looked like a battle scene rather than a sex club.” Met officers attended along with the London Ambulance service and four people were taken to hospital. Three of the victims had been stabbed, police said. Their injuries are not believed to be life threatening. Three men were arrested, one on suspicion of GBH and possession with intent to supply, one man on suspicion of GBH and another man on suspicion of possession with intent to supply.  Police said they had imposed a Section 76 Closure Notice “to prevent further disruption to the local area,” which allows them to shutter the property for up to 48 hours.

Magistrates were told last year that police had been dispatched to the address 63 times over the last few years. Neighbours have said they have suffered years of extremely loud music, revellers taking drugs and vomiting in the street. Last December, Davenport flew back from Thailand to successfully challenge the closure order at City of London Magistrates’ Court. He denies hosting all-night parties, saying he hosts art shows there every months with around 100 people, but that gatherings do not go on beyond midnight. He also denied any drug-taking at the mansion. “I am very anti-drugs, I don’t drink, I have had two kidney transplants,” he said. “Nobody would be smoking marijuana in my house. “I am absolutely certain there is no illegal activity (at the parties).” Magistrate Mr Gowlett said at the time: “We do not find the case for closure has been proved on balance of probability, and therefore refuse the order that is sought.”\n",

Anyone with a hazelnut allergy who unwittingly ate these products could face serious health problems. Around 2% of children and 0.5% of adults in the UK have a tree nut allergy, according to Allergy UK.

The affected batches of Cheshire Farm's 1L Biscoff Ice Cream tubs are under codes L23139, with a best before date of 19 November, 2024, and L23261, with a best before date of 18 March, 2025. The affected batch of Caramelized Biscuit Ice Cream was sold under the code L24150, with the best before date of 29 November, 2025. Cheshire Farm said that anyone who had bought these products should not eat them if they have a nut allergy, and instead should take them back to the shop for a refund. The company warned: \"If you have bought the above products and have an allergy to nuts do not eat them.\" Cheshire Farm also said it did not have any affiliation with the Lotus Biscoff brand and its ice cream does not contain any Biscoff products.\n",

      "Mikel Arteta said he would concede the Premier League title to Liverpool \"over my dead body\" as he insisted Arsenal can still be crowned champions.\n",
      "The Gunners head to Nottingham Forest on Wednesday 11 points adrift of Liverpool following the Reds' weekend victory at Manchester City, a day after Arteta's side slumped to a 1-0 loss against West Ham at the Emirates. Following the defeat to the Hammers - after which he criticised his players for failing to reach the standards required to end the club's 21-year wait for the title - Arteta conceded the championship race was no longer in his hands.

Mathematically, it's possible. You are there. You have to play every game. Suddenly, three days ago, we could close the gap to five points. It doesn't matter. We have to continue to go. \"The difficulty is higher than it was. But if you want to win the the Premier League, you're going to have to do something special. You're probably going to have to do something that nobody else has done in the history of the Premier League.\" Arsenal's bid to win the title has been derailed by a series of injuries, with Kai Havertz and Gabriel Jesus out for the season. Bukayo Saka is due to return next month having been sidelined since December, while Gabriel Martinelli is also currently unavailable. Captain Martin Odegaard missed 12 games with an ankle injury earlier in the campaign, while Arsenal have also battled suspensions. Five players have been sent off in their 26 league games so far. The Gunners have been Liverpool's closest challengers this season, and have progressed to the last 16 of the Champions League, but Arteta believes his side could easily have been dumped out of Europe and left battling in mid-table. He continued: \"If somebody tells you at the start of the season, by this time, you have played five times with a red card over half an hour in each of those games, and you have lost this amount of players, what's the bet? You are in the middle of the table, at least, and you are out of the Champions League. \"That's not the situation. So that tells you the resilience, the resources, the ambition that the team has, every individual has, and that has been probably been one of the proudest moments in my time to work. \"It was a very disappointing weekend. In the previous 15 games, we have won 10 and drawn five, exactly the same as Liverpool, with exactly the same goal difference, which is plus 23. \"We have been extremely consistent for the last three and a half months, considering everything that we've been through, and we have generated that momentum. \"When you are trying to build that momentum and we're putting so much into it, especially with the circumstances that we have, the defeat against West Ham was a very hard one to take. On top of that, they (Liverpool) win. \"But the reality is that there's so many games to play, and you have to get back to it. You're going to have to set a certain amount of numbers to win this league.\"And we're going to have to hit that number if we're going to have any chance of doing that. But we're certainly going to continue to try.\"  \n",

      "Ms Pritchard has announced she will stand down at the end of the financial year, saying it was a \"hugely difficult decision\".  \t In a statement, she said: \"It has been an enormous privilege to lead the NHS in England through what has undoubtedly been the most difficult period in its history.  \t \"I am immensely proud of the NHS response to Covid-19, and how we have delivered steady recovery from the inevitable impacts of the pandemic, with performance in urgent and emergency care, elective and cancer all improving over the past two years, while NHS teams delivered record levels of activity in primary care, community and mental health services, meaning millions more appointments for patients.  \t \"We always knew the recovery period after a once-in-a-century pandemic was going to be incredibly challenging, and whilst the timeliness and experience of care is still not good enough for too many people, the NHS has achieved a great deal in the face of historic pressure thanks to a relentless focus on innovation and reform.  \t \"From the rollout of Community Diagnostic Centres and mental health teams in schools, to world leading cancer vaccines and the development of the App, the NHS now feels very different to when I became chief executive over three and a half years ago.  \t \"While it has been a hugely difficult decision for me to stand down, I believe now is the right time, with the NHS making continued progress in our recovery, and with the foundations firmly in place to deliver the 10-Year Health Plan.  \t \"The NHS is full of extraordinary people, who do extraordinary things every day for patients.  \"The achievements I have listed above, and many more, are theirs - and I am confident they will continue to achieve incredible things for patients now, and into the future.\" Health Secretary Wes Streeting has said Ms Pritchard should be \"enormously proud of the leadership\" she's given the NHS. \"She steered NHS England out of the pandemic, during turbulent political waters and six secretaries of state.   \"She has led with integrity and unwavering commitment,\" he added.

The former Chelsea, Manchester United, Tottenham and Real Madrid manager made comments about the Galatasaray bench \"jumping like monkeys\" after an early challenge and the match being better because it was not officiated by a Turkish referee.

The Portuguese was charged with \"unsportsmanlike behaviour towards opposing team fans\" and \"diminishing the value of Turkish football and... discrediting the impartiality of the referees and other match officials\" during an outspoken post-match interview.\n",

      "-------\n",
      "The head of Ofcom has told LBC that the regulator will \"name and shame\" social media companies that fail to protect women and girls in the UK adequately.\n",
      "Melanie Dawes, who runs the communications regulator, told LBC's Nick Ferrari at Breakfast that women face \"a real culture of misogyny, harassment [and] intimate image abuse\". She was describing Ofcom's plans to \"shine a light\" on tech companies that fail to be proactive in making their sites safer and easier to use, especially for women and girls. The regulator is consulting on new guidance on measures tech firms should use to help better protect women and girls on their sites. These will include the better use of technology to prevent intimate image abuse, as well as a request for sites to consider introducing tools which would help spot and fix ways they can be exploited by abusers. Dawes said the problem was even more widespread than some might think. \"When I talk to women, you know, what's so striking is this isn't a niche issue, this isn't about just vulnerable women, it's actually about ordinary women going about their daily lives online,\" she said. She claimed that women are \"five times more likely than men to have intimate image abuse against them, much more likely to have harassments or pile-ons just for expressing an opinion.  \"So it's fundamentally about people's freedom of speech not actually being a real thing online, if you're a woman in the UK, in the same way as it is for men.\" The guidance joins already published legally binding codes of practice on illegal content and protecting children online that have already been put in place by Ofcom. These will begin to take effect next month under the Online Safety Act, and which carry large financial penalties if found to have been breached. Dawes said it was unclear to what extent the tech firms themselves would take action when the Online Safety Act comes in, and how much Ofcom would need to enforce. \"It's a six million dollar question how much action is going to come and how much are we going to need to drive through with enforcement action,\" she said. \"We're ready for that. But this is a big cultural change for the industry. There's a lot to fix. So all eyes now on the tech industry as far as I'm concerned.\" Dawes said in an earlier statement that the new guidance was a \"call to action for online services\". \"There's not only a moral imperative for tech firms to protect the interests of female users, but it also makes sound commercial sense - fostering greater trust and engagement with a significant proportion of their customer base,\" she said.\" Dawes' colleague Jessica Smith, who led the development of the guidance, said the regulator was also prepared to use its powers under the Online Safety Act to highlight platforms not doing enough to protect women and girls on their sites through new online safety transparency reports. \"Effectively, what we are going to do is use our information-gathering and transparency powers,\" she told the PA news agency. \"So one of the things we're committing to do is, once the guidance is finalised and a sufficient period of time has passed, is we'll publish a transparency report that shines a light on what platforms are doing and not doing to keep their users safe. \"It's about putting information out there, so users can be informed and make a choice about where they spend their time online.\" She added: \"What we're saying to platforms today is that you have a commercial choice. \"We know that women spend longer online than men, for example, on a daily basis, and so we think it makes good commercial sense to take their safety seriously. \"For some platforms, they may not choose to do that, and that is their decision. But as I said, then we will make sure people know what kind of space they are entering into when they go on that kind of platform.\" Under the Online Safety Act, platforms will be legally required to follow a new set of duties around protecting users from harm online, with fines of up to 10% of global turnover for those who fail to do so - which could run into billions of pounds for the largest services. New regulation of the online world has been broadly welcomed, but some charities and campaigners have warned that the current plans have taken too long to implement, and do not go far enough to protect users from harm. In response, Ms Smith said: \"We're at the fairly early days when it comes to implementation of the Act. \"I think we're still at the stage of testing and implementing the powers that we have now, and I know that this has taken a while, so I really understand people's frustration. \"I think when it comes to this particular guidance, we are balancing quite difficult issues. There are issues around free expression.\" As well as women and girls, Ms Smith said it was vital the regulator also heard from men and boys on the issues raised. \"Obviously, this guidance is focused on women and girls, and we've spoken to a lot of survivors and women's advocacy organisations as part of the process, but it's also for men and boys - these tools can be for everybody,\" she said. \"We know boys are more exposed to online misogyny than girls are, so we think that this will have broader benefits and we're keen to speak to men and boys as part of our consultation process.\"\n",

      "Robotics company Ocean Infinity is looking for the wreckage of the plane on the seabed of the Indian Ocean, 1,200 miles off the western Australian city of Perth. Its deep-water support vessel Armada 7806 deployed autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) at the search site. These are operated via satellite from a control room at the company's headquarters in Southampton. If the wreckage is found, then Ocean Infinity can also send out remote vehicles to help recover it, also to be controled remotely. The mission may represent the last hope of finding MH370, which disappeared on March 8, 2014 after taking off from Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur for a flight to Beijing.

All 239 people who were on board are presumed dead - but none have been found, and there is no conclusive explanation for what happened. Two major search operations were launched, one from 2014-2017, and another in 2018, neither of which found the aircraft. Several pieces of debris washed up onshore in the years following the disappearance, some of which were confirmed to belong to MH370. Ocean Infinity was previously in talks with the Malaysian government for a £55 million payout if it found the wreckage, operating on a 'no-find, no-fee' basis. But no agreement is thought to have been finalised, and the Telegraph reported that the company was operating on its own account. Ocean Infinity founder Oliver Plunkett has described finding the wreckage as his life's ambition. A previous mission by the company in 2018 was abandoned without success. This mission, due to last four weeks, will focus on an arc in the southern Indian Ocean where the plane is thought to have come down. Ocean Infinity will scour up to four sites where the plane may have crashed, including one where earlier searches may not have given enough attention. The total search area is thought to be around 5,800 square miles.\n",

      "A cameraman for a controversial BBC documentary about life in Gaza has been accused of ‘celebrating’ the October 7 massacre.\n",
      "Hatem Rawagh is reported to have praised the terror attack on social media. He tweeted about the 1973 Yom Kippur war - when Egypt and Syria attacked Israel. In the post he said: “Whoever missed Oct 6 in Egypt...Oct 7 is happening in Palestine.” He went on to post online apparently celebrating the killing of an Israeli soldier.  He captioned a video of a gunman: “You are going back to this video a million times.” The video was originally posted by Hamas’s al-Qassam brigades. It depicts the point of view of a gunman killing a soldier in Erez, near the Gaza border. He also shared celebrations at the Omari mosque in Gaza in April 2023 after a car attack in Tel Aviv which killed an Italian tourist and left seven others injured.

The documentary was made by the BBC's Current Affair TV arm which paid award-winning Hoyo Films to make it. Former director of BBC television Danny Cohen said: \"The BBC needs to account for every penny spent on this documentary - £400,000 is a lot of licence-fee payers money.  \"They should be transparently told where their money went and whether any of it reached the hands of Hamas. \"The BBC must also launch a wider investigation into systemic bias against Israel after repeated editorial failures since the October 7 massacres.\" The BBC initially kept the documentary online with an added disclaimer before removing it from iPlayer while conducting further ‘due diligence’. It is co-directed by Jamie Roberts, an Emmy-award-winning filmmaker, and Yousef Hammash, a Bafta-award-winning Palestinian journalist. It was filmed by two cameramen which Mr Rawagh hired as an “additional camera.” Mr Rawagh’s tweets were uncovered by the Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting and Analysis (Camera). A spokesman for Camera said: “These posts appear to be glorifying the horrific terrorist acts committed on October 7, 2023. Anyone who wrote them has no place working for the BBC. Here is yet more evidence of the editorial failings in the documentary for which the BBC must answer.” An internal report into the programme will be presented to the BBC board on Thursday. The corporation is expected to announce a summary of findings either on Thursday or by Friday morning. According to the Telegraph, the programme was viewed by Jo Carr, the BBC’s head of current affairs, prior to broadcast. She described the documentary as a “story of immense consequence” in a press release issued on Jan 20. A BBC spokesman said: “Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone features important stories we think should be told – those of the experiences of children in Gaza. There have been continuing questions raised about the programme and in the light of these, we are conducting further due diligence with the production company. The programme will not be available on iPlayer while this is taking place.”\n",

      "Energy bills are set to rise again, with the price cap lifted by more than expected.\n",
      "Regulator Ofgem announced on Tuesday that its energy price cap would go up by 6% from 1 April, taking the typical gas and electricity bill to £1,849 per year, from £1,738. Industry onlookers had expected the price cap to rise by 5%. Ofgem said a recent spike in wholesale prices was the main driver of the price rise, accounting for around 78% of the total increase, while a small increase in policy costs and associated inflationary pressures made up a further 22%. Ofgem chief executive Jonathan Brearley said: \"We know that no price rise is ever welcome, and that the cost of energy remains a huge challenge for many households. Read more: Nearly three million more households could get energy bill discounts next winter, Labour says Read more: Landlords face £6k bill to meet higher energy efficiency targets under government plans \"But our reliance on international gas markets leads to volatile wholesale prices, and continues to drive up bills, which is why it's more important than ever that we're driving forward investment in a cleaner, homegrown system. \"Energy debts that began during the energy crisis have reached record levels and without intervention will continue to grow. This puts families under huge stress and increases costs for all customers. We're developing plans that could give households with unmanageable debt the clean slate they need to move forward. \"We welcome the Government's support for these plans, and their plans to expand the Warm Home Discount, which will also offer financial help to nearly three million more households that need it most. \"If anyone is worried about paying their bills, I would urge them to reach out to their supplier to make sure they're getting all the help they can. Where possible, switching or fixing tariffs now could also help to bring costs down and provide certainty over coming payments.\" It comes as the government said on Tuesday that it was looking to expand its financial support for energy bills. Ministers said next winter one in five families in Britain would get financial help. Around 2.7 million extra households, including nearly one million with children, would be eligible for the £150 Warm Home Discount next winter, the government added. This would bring the total number of recipient homes to an estimated 6.1 million. Responding to the price cap rise, Simon Francis, coordinator of campaign group the End Fuel Poverty Coalition, called for billions more in support for vulnerable customers. He said it is \"crucial to provide support for vulnerable households struggling with energy costs now\", calling for £13.2 billion of support at the Government's upcoming spending review. \"The big question will be how do we pay for these improvements in support. Both Warm Home Discounts and debt relief are traditionally funded through our energy bills. \"Yet the energy industry makes billions of pounds in profit every year and it beggars belief that Ofgem is increasing the profit allowance for suppliers in the current climate. \"For now, the advice for households is to make the most of existing energy efficiency schemes and if customers do shop around for a lower energy bill, they must use their own energy usage on price comparison sites.\"\n",

      "Mark Cranfield, the former Met and West Mercia Police constable, sent social media messages - including one discussing his sex life - to the highly vulnerable woman, a two-week trial was told.  \t Jailing the married 52-year-old at Birmingham Crown Court on Thursday, Judge Kerry Maylin described the offences as a \"grave betrayal\" of the woman's trust in the police.  \t Cranfield, who sent a friend request to the woman minutes after she left a police station where he had downloaded a video given to him as evidence, had an \"exemplary\" career until the misconduct began in 2018, the judge said.  \t The woman ended up withdrawing her complaint and cut off contact with the police because Cranfield made her feel uncomfortable, the judge said.  Read more: Brothers deny assaulting police officers in viral video at Manchester Airport Read more: Rare freezing rain that poses risks for planes and downs trees will hit UK in days, warns Met Office Judge Maylin told Cranfield, who appeared in the dock with his head bowed for much of his sentencing hearing: \"She told this court that you seemed more interested in the content of the photos and the video of an intimate nature than in supporting (her) and investigating the allegations that she made.  \t \"You were exploring whether you could have an intimate relationship with her, be that in person or online.\"  \t The fact that the images had been forwarded by Cranfield to an unidentified phone number had had \"a marked impact\" on the victim, the judge said.  \t She continued: \"Misconduct in a public office committed by police officers is always a grave betrayal of trust.  \t \"Punishment and deterrence are important elements in cases such as this.  \t \"You have now expressed remorse but I am afraid, doing my public duty, I cannot accede to the submission to suspend your sentence.\" Cranfield, who was based at Ludlow police station in Shropshire, was convicted in December of two counts of misconduct in public office and an offence of accessing computer records, including the woman's phone number, without authorisation.  \t Jurors were told Cranfield made his attraction to the woman obvious when she made a complaint and provided evidence to police, smirking as he told her: \"I'm glad I got to see the pictures.\"  \t The court heard he then had inappropriate contact with the victim, sent her messages about his sex life, and forwarded intimate videos and images to a WhatsApp account that has yet to be traced.  \t The former officer was cleared of a third misconduct offence relating to the social media friend request.  \t Cranfield told his trial that he had no sexual interest in the woman and believed he had deleted the images and video, which were found on his work phone more than two years after the inquiry.  \t Cranfield, of Bromfield, near Ludlow, denied he had been \"titillated\" by the video, said he had contacted the woman via a social media messaging app to discuss \"everyday\" issues and had only sent further messages in a panic because his wife wrongly believed he was having an affair.  \t Prosecutor Simon Rippon told the trial that the offences came to light in April 2021, when Cranfield's work phone was seized from his locker without warning for reasons entirely unconnected to the case.  \t Mr Rippon said two photographs of the complainant were found on the phone, with a video of the woman stripping and engaging in a sexual act.  \t Other images of the woman wearing clothing had been deleted, the court heard.  \t A statement read to the trial during the defence case said Cranfield, who was a constable for 27 years, spent the majority of his service with the Met on royal protection duties and had also been an armed officer with the West Mercia force.  \t Offering mitigation prior to sentence, defence barrister Liz Power said Cranfield was a hardworking family man who had been stacking shelves at Tesco \"to add a little bit more to the family income\".  \t Ms Power added: \"This was a man who, for whatever the reason, was clearly under some difficulties in his relationship with his wife and found solace in contacting someone else.  \t \"As a police officer, he shouldn't have done it, he overstepped the line.\" IOPC regional director Derrick Campbell: “PC Cranfield’s actions prevented allegations of a criminal offence being fully investigated, following his pursuit of a relationship with a woman who was in a vulnerable situation.  \"Alongside that, he accessed police systems without a policing purpose and used his work mobile phone to look at, share and keep evidence, without a policing purpose. “The officer’s admission of using police intelligence systems in order to obtain personal information about his family is extremely serious.  \"He had no legitimate reason for doing so and his actions have the potential to damage the public’s confidence in police officers.”\n",

      "The Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police yesterday hit out at an \"absurd\" ruling by the High Court which said he couldn’t dismiss officers who have unproven allegations of sexual abuse against them, by revoking their vetting.  Urging the Home Office to bring forward changes to the regulations \"within weeks\", Sir Mark Rowley warned the bill would run into the \"many tens of millions\" of pounds if people who have been sacked seek to return.  He made clear that they wouldn’t be allowed back on the frontline or into the office and would remain on special leave until he is able to legally get rid of them.

It's not the hardest thing in the world to change.”  Addressing members of the London Assembly, he added: “We're spending millions of pounds on the current people who are on paid leave at home and I think the bill for them would run to about seven million a year.  “But if the regulations aren't fixed, that number will tick up and up and up and if the people who have already left are left with a right to come back and get back pay and sue us, then it gets to the many tens of millions.”  The warning comes as Scotland Yard finalises its budget, warning that a large proportion of their \"tough choices\" list would have to be executed, which included the possibility of cutting more than 2,000 officers and 400 staff members.  The Met confirmed it would be appealing the High Court judgement, which was made in favour of dismissed Sergeant Lino Di Maria, forcing a halt to Scotland Yard’s current efforts to clean up its ranks.  Operation Assure, which put officers and staff back through security checks if they had a pattern of allegations against them, has seen 96 officers leave the force with another 29 already on special leave.  More than 300 had been referred through the framework since it began.  Sir Mark Rowley said: “I don't apologise for stepping into legally uncertain, untested space. The most important thing is the integrity of the police.  “It's not enormous numbers but it's big enough to be a threat to our integrity if we don't take it on.  This is about everybody in the organisation who wants rid of these people.  “I'm disappointed that the High Court feels the law doesn't allow the tactics we were using and we will appeal that but regardless, we urgently need to change the regulation.”  Last night, the education secretary confirmed to LBC that vetting processes will be “overhauled” by the government.  Bridget Phillipson told Andrew Marr: \"It underlines the importance of making sure we press ahead as fast as we can around the changes we need to make on vetting.  “The Home Secretary will make sure that vetting is overhauled, so we can be completely confident that police officers serving the public are fit and proper people to be carrying out those duties.\"\n",

      "It was confirmed on Tuesday that Britain's biggest police force is set to challenge a High Court ruling that it cannot sack officers by removing their vetting clearance.  \t The ruling has been described as a \"test case\" that officials say will have major implications for the sacking of police officers accused of misconduct. Asked by Andrew Marr on LBC for her personal opinion on the ruling, Ms Phillipson, who also serves as women's minister, said: \"I think it under my view, and that of the Government overall, is that it underlines the need to take action in this area.\" She added: \"It underlines the importance of making sure we press ahead as fast as we can around the changes we need to make on vetting.\"  \t Asked by Mr Marr if the ruling made her worried for the safety of women in London, Ms Phillipson added: \"It is precisely for that reason that the Home Secretary will make sure that vetting is overhauled, so we can be completely confident that police officers serving the public are fit and proper people to be carrying out those duties.\" The case was brought by Sergeant Lino Di Maria, after he was deemed unfit to serve because of sexual assault allegations - which he denies. He has not been charged and has challenged his dismissal as unlawful. The head of the force Mark Rowley says it leaves the force in a \"hopeless position\". \"We now have no mechanism to rid the Met of officers who are not fit to hold vetting. \"We now have no mechanism to rid the Met of officers who were not fit to hold vetting - those who cannot be trusted to work with women, or those who cannot be trusted to enter the homes of vulnerable people. He added it was \"absolutely absurd\" the force cannot sack them. He added: \"This would not be the case in other sectors where staff have nothing like the powers comparable to police officers.\" More than 300 officers and staff are either in the process of or have already had their vetting removed as part of an operation started to review historical complaints after the crimes committed by Wayne Couzens and David Carrick while they were serving PCs.

      "A retired police officer has been cleared by a jury for knocking two men off an electric motorbike in order to \"protect life\".  \t\n",
      "Former-Pc Tim Bradshaw, 55, was found not guilty of causing serious injury by dangerous driving, after a trial at Portsmouth Crown Court.  \t The jury took one hour to reach the verdict, and to clear him of an alternative charge of causing serious injury by driving without due care and attention, in Hawthorn Road, Bognor Regis, West Sussex, on November 3 2022.  \t Speaking to the jury, Judge David Melville KC told them: \"Thank you very much indeed. You will realise that was an important case, not only for this defendant but throughout the country.\"  \t The court heard that the response officer touched the back wheel of the e-bike with his Ford Focus marked police car, causing the rider, Mason McGarry, and pillion passenger Dominic Mizzi, to lose control and fall to the ground.  \t Mr McGarry, who was 17 at the time, suffered a broken tibia and required surgery, and told the court that Bradshaw had not given any warning.  \t The court heard that Mr McGarry had more than 40 convictions, including for robbery, theft and dangerous driving.  \t Mr Mizzi, 22, also told the court that he had numerous convictions, including for assaulting emergency workers.  \t Mr Bradshaw, a married father-of-one, told the court that it was Mr Mizzi's \"own stupid fault\" that he had been involved in the incident.  \t He also said that the use of a \"tactical contact\" manoeuvre had been authorised previously by his superiors, and he was permitted to use \"reasonable force\".  \t Mr Bradshaw, who retired in June last year, said: \"I was presented with a situation which in my view was a perfect opportunity to make contact with that bike and stop a pursuit and the increased risk.\"  \t He said that he had \"nudged\" the electric bike with the bumper of his vehicle and added: \"It was light contact, it was light enough, there was not a blemish on my police car.\"  \t He added: \"I believed it was a justified, necessary action.\"  \t Mr Bradshaw described in court how police were involved in regular pursuits with electric motorbikes in the seaside town, but were normally unable to stop the riders because of the speed of the vehicles and their ability to go down alleyways and closed roads.  \t The court also heard that Mr Mizzi had been injured in a previous e-bike accident, and another young man had been killed in a crash nearby in the previous month.  \t Andy Newman, deputy chairman of Sussex Police Federation, read a statement outside court on behalf of Mr Bradshaw.  \t He said: \"Today a jury has taken 20 minutes to come to a not guilty verdict and clear the name of retired Pc Tim Bradshaw.  \t \"This case demonstrates that police officers only have seconds to make decisions in order to uphold the law.  \t \"Tim hopes that going forward police organisations will show the bravery and confidence that this jury has shown in supporting and protecting communities.  \t \"Police officers like Tim are out protecting communities 365 days a year making sure that you are safe.  \t \"He would like to thank his legal team, Mark Alfred, MGR Solicitors and Sussex Police Federation, and his family who have supported him through the two years and three months that this has taken to come to court.\"  \t Superintendent Rachel Glenton, head of roads policing for Surrey and Sussex police forces, said: \"We expect the highest driving standards from our officers and staff, and road safety and reducing the number of people killed and seriously injured on the roads is a priority for the force.  \t \"It was important that this case was decided by a jury, and we are grateful to those members of the public who carefully considered all of the evidence presented before the court.\"  \t A Sussex Police spokeswoman said that the force would re-examine whether Mr Bradshaw would face disciplinary proceedings.  \t She said: \"The force's Professional Standards Department will reassess the matter following the conclusion of the criminal investigation.\"  \t She added: \"The force follows national guidance from the College of Policing's authorised professional practice on police pursuits and police driving.\"\n",

      "A detective sergeant has been jailed for 18 months after sexually assaults on two colleagues at work in two separate incidents, a court has heard. \n",
      "\n",
      "Richard Mills, 42, had served as an officer for Greater Manchester Police since 2006.  He was found guilty of assaulting the women twice over the past 10 years.The father-of-two was \"enabled\" and \"emboldened\" by a culture within the lower ranks of the force of \"you don't report bobbies\", a judge said during a sentencing hearing at Liverpool Crown Court. Mills claimed during the hearing \"sexualised banter\" was allowed to fester in the workplace. His wife was in the courtroom at the time. The officer often held conversations with colleagues that had “sexual overturns”, the judge said . His first victim accused him of putting his hand on her crotch after he told her what kind of sex he liked, saying he was not \"getting it\" from his wife. Read more: Police launch fresh search efforts for missing girl linked to prime Madeleine McCann suspect Read more: Mohamed Al Fayed's brother 'unequivocally' denies sexual assault allegations by three former Harrods employees She told others about the incident but did not support an investigation into Mills at the time. He was issed a verbal warning but no misconduct hearing took place. \"You should have learnt your lesson,” the judge said. The second victim said she \"froze\" when Mills put her hand onto his crotch while in a room with other people.\"That added to her sense of shame and embarrassment that you felt enabled to do that in that room believing she would not say anything,\" the judge said. The women had had their \"mental health, careers and their lives blighted\" by what Mills had done, the judge added. He continued: \"When police officers commit offences like this, or any other sort of offence, you undermine every other officer because it does damage public trust in police.\" One of the victims said, according to the prosecution team: \"How do you call the police about the police?\" She added: \"I used to be such a happy, smiley and bubbly character and I feel the complete opposite. I just feel sad all the time.\"Mills’s defence team continually denied the offences. The defence lawyer said: \"He will lose his job as a result of this, the disciplinary proceedings will take their course but there is an inevitability about that.\" The circumstances are very much now in the public arena, having been published, and it is extremely humiliating not just for him but for those close to him, including his wife who has attended today.\" He said Mills had shown insight into his previous conduct and was no longer \"the tactile person he was\". He added: \"He would say that what he saw as acceptable banter at the time he now appreciates was unacceptable, particularly in the modern environment, and he will change his approach.\" Mills was cleared of three other counts of sexual assault following his trial.\n",

      "-------\n",
      "Former Prime Minister Boris Johnson has revealed he is “no longer sure” his decision to put the country into Covid lockdowns worked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Writing in his new memoir, Johnson said lockdowns certainly “had some effect” but he has doubts whether they made a tangible difference. He said: “There were always two waves, whether you were in China, where lockdowns were ruthlessly enforced, or Sweden, where they took a more voluntary approach.” “Maybe there are limits to human agency,” the extract continued. \"Maybe it isn’t possible for government action to repel the waves of a highly contagious disease, any more than it is possible to repel the tide of the Thames. “I am not saying that lockdowns achieved nothing; I am sure they had some effect. “But were they decisive in beating back the disease, turning that wave down? \"All I can say is that I am no longer sure.” This comes after Chris Whitty told the Covid inquiry that some onlookers might say the UK overstated the risk that the virus posed to the public at the start of the pandemic. Prof Whitty, the UK's chief medical officer, said he still worries about whether the government and its advisers found the right balance between public protections and personal freedoms. He said: “I was worried at the beginning. I still worry, actually in retrospect, about whether we got the level of concern right,” he said. “Were we either over pitching it so that people were incredibly afraid of something where in fact, their actuarial risk was low, or we were not pitching it enough and therefore people didn’t realise the risk they were walking into. “I think that balance is really hard, and arguably, some people would say we, if anything we overdid it, rather than under [at] the beginning.” But he said that the arguments against widespread Covid restrictions were \"obviously not true\", and said that they should not be followed in any future pandemic - \"unless you can demonstrate it.\" He added: \"I think we probably should have been swifter off the mark in spotting long Covid as it emerged, although I think we were relatively quick and it wasn't obvious, we could have done something different as a result. \"The main thing we could do at the beginning, before we understood it slightly better, was to reduce the amount of Covid. If you don't get Covid, you don't get long Covid.\" Discussing the shielding of elderly and vulnerable people, Prof Whitty said the policy had pluses and minuses. He said: \"I think it was beneficial in one way, harming another way, and uncertain in a third.\" Asked if he would consider a similar approach in a future pandemic, he added: \"There are two things I would definitely do. I think shielding, I'm unsure about, it would depend on the situation. \"I definitely think that the risk classification is really important because there are many other things that flow from them. And indeed, you don't know what will flow from them always when you do it. \"And secondly, I do think it's important to put in place a mechanism to support people who rationally have chosen to take themselves out of society, to better their ability to protect themselves. \"Whether the particular approach to shielding we took is an appropriate one to use, again, in respiratory infection, I honestly don't know.\"\n",

      "-------\n",
      "Former Prime Minister Boris Johnson believed he “might have carked it” when he was in intensive care with Covid, according to an extract of his memoir.\n",
      "Johnson, who became PM in July 2019, spent several days in intensive care at St Thomas' Hospital in London with Covid in April 2020. The former PM was initially admitted to hospital with \"persistent symptoms\" before being moved to intensive care after his symptoms \"worsened\", Downing Street revealed at the time. Writing in his new memoir, Unleashed, Johnson has described not wanting to fall asleep on his first night in intensive care “partly in case I never woke up”. He also recalled feeling “rotten” with “guilt” and “political embarrassment” in the days before he was admitted to hospital after testing positive at the end of March. Following his release from hospital, the then prime minister spent some time at Chequers with his now-wife Carrie, and he recalled joining in with the clap for the NHS on a Thursday evening. “I clapped with deep emotion because my lungs were telling me that I had been through something really pretty nasty, and that if it hadn’t been for Jenny and Luis, fiddling with those oxygen tubes all night with all their skill and experience, I think I might have carked it,” he wrote. On his admission to ICU, Mr Johnson said he “started to doze, but didn’t want to sleep – partly in case I never woke up, or in case they decided to perform some stealthy tracheotomy without letting me know”. There were a number of days between Mr Johnson announcing he had tested positive for Covid at the end of March 2020 and going into hospital at the beginning of April, and he described himself as feeling “so rotten”. “It wasn’t just the physical distress; it was the guilt, the political embarrassment of it all,” he said. “I needed to be out there, leading the country from the front, sorting the PPE, fixing the care homes, driving the quest for a cure.” Johnson later stepped down as an MP after a Tory-majority committee found he mislead parliament over 'partygate' on multiple occasions. The investigation by the committee was launched in the wake of Sue Gray's report, which blamed a \"failure of leadership and judgement\" for lockdown-busting parties that took place in Number 10 during the COVID pandemic. This is just one of  a number of revelations from Johnson’s memoir with the former PM also revealing a secret plot was devised to invade Holland and seize Covid vaccines. Johnson said he drew up plans for British special forces to step in after \"futile\" negotiations with EU chiefs over the release of five million vaccines. He writes he intended to take matters into his own hands when supplies were \"kidnapped\" by Brussels bureaucrats in a warehouse in Leiden. He convened a meeting of senior military officials in March 2021 to discuss the plans.

But the senior officer said it would not be possible to do this undetected, with lockdowns meaning the authorities might observe the raid, meaning the UK would \"have to explain why we are effectively invading a long-standing Nato ally\". It was later concluded that the idea was \"nuts\".\n",

He claims that when former Cabinet minister Michael Gove found out he could die, \"his spectacles seemed to glitter at the thought\". The ex-PM says he initially ignored advice to go to hospital, despite being so ill he could barely walk, think or read. He goes on to say that he fought to stay awake while in the Intensive Care Unit at St Thomas’s hospital, amid concerns he would never wake up. Addressing Partygate, Mr Johnson says he made \"several mistakes\" but now believes he should have doubled down and defended himself instead of apologising. He also hits out at Partygate investigator Sue Gray, saying she was behind a \"ridiculous and unfair witch-hunt\". Referencing the \"cake\" meeting at No10, which resulted in a police fine, Mr Johnson says: \"I saw no cake. I ate no blooming cake. \"If this was a party, it was the feeblest event in the history of human festivity.\"\n",

      "The former PM was called in to stop Harry from stepping back from royal duties and moving away with Meghan in January 2020. Writing in his new memoir, Unleashed, Mr Johnson said his efforts were \"totally hopeless\" - as the duke left for Canada the following day. Mr Johnson recalled: \"There was a ridiculous business when they made me try to persuade Harry to stay. Kind of manly pep talk. Totally hopeless.\" He said the meeting took place during a UK-Africa investment summit, which was also one of Harry's final appearances as a working royal.

The meeting lasted 20 minutes - with no aides present - as Mr Johnson urged the duke to reconsider his decision. A friend told the Mail, which is serialising the memoir ahead of its release, that Mr Johnson praised Harry's efforts with the Invictus Games and Meghan's work on the education of women and girls in developing countries. \"He thought they were a great asset to UK plc and it was a real shame they were leaving when they were doing such great work,\" the friend said. \"It was a man-to-man conversation, they were totally alone. But Harry wasn't for turning – he was unpersuadable by that point. \"Boris succeeded in delivering Brexit but even he couldn't stop Megxit.\" A week earlier Harry, the Queen, Charles and William had met at Sandringham to discuss the move. But despite the several attempts to change his mind, Harry refused to budge and instead fled to Canada with Meghan. They then moved to Montecito, California, where they still live with their children, Archie and Lilibet.\n",

      "Boris Johnson has urged Donald Trump to back Ukraine, in a one-on-one meeting with the US presidential candidate.\n",
      "The British former Prime Minister said Mr Trump was \"on top form\" despite the \"shameful\" attempt to assassinate him over the weekend. Mr Johnson posted a photo of the encounter on his Twitter, with Mr Trump's right ear still bandaged from the shooting attempt on Saturday evening. The meeting took place on the sidelines of the Republican convention. Mr Johnson said: \"Great to meet President Trump who is on top form after the shameful attempt on his life.  \"We discussed Ukraine and I have no doubt that he will be strong and decisive in supporting that country and defending democracy.\" The meeting is said to have lasted around half an hour. Mr Johnson also gave a speech at the convention.

Mr Vance has been a high-profile sceptic of America's backing of the war in Ukraine. Mr Trump has also spoken out against US interventionism in the past, and NATO allies are said to be concerned that if he regains the presidency, America's vital backing of the alliance and of Ukraine may falter. By contrast, Mr Johnson has been a staunch defender of Ukraine both during his time in Downing Street and since then. Mr Johnson and Mr Trump overlapped as the leaders of their respective countries for about a year.  Mr Johnson was elected Prime Minister in December 2019, with Mr Trump losing the presidency to Joe Biden in November 2020. The two are said to have enjoyed good relations, despite Mr Johnson criticising Mr Trump while he was mayor of London. Mr Johnson earlier said it was a \"miracle\" that Mr Trump survived the attempt on his life. He said: \"As we give thanks for his safety we are reminded once again of the tragic fragility of democracy in the face of violence and unreason.  \"Our thoughts are with the president and the Trump family.\" Mr Johnson has previously said he would endorse Mr Trump, provided he continues US support for Kyiv.\t \"If he does the right thing and backs the Ukrainians, and I believe he will, a Trump presidency can be a big win for the world,\" he wrote in his newspaper column. Sir Keir Starmer has said his government will work with whoever the next president is, but senior figures were on Tuesday forced to push back against widely criticised remarks by Mr Trump's candidate for vice president. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner said she did not \"recognise that characterisation\" after Mr Trump's running mate JD Vance described Britain under Labour as the first \"truly Islamist\" country with a nuclear weapon, while Defence Secretary John Healey said the comment was \"controversial\".\n",

      "Boris Johnson has said that Nigel Farage played \"a significant part\" in \"the destruction of the Tory government\", as he warned the Conservatives against merging with Reform UK.\n",
      "The former Prime Minister labelled Mr Farage the \"Pied Piper of Clacton\", after the constituency he won in the election, which saw the Conservatives dumped out of office. Reform gained five seats overall but won over 14% of the vote, much of which may have otherwise gone to the Conservatives. The number of Tory MPs dropped to just 121, down 255 - the party's worst electoral performance in modern history. And Mr Johnson said that Reform was \"the Yucatan asteroid in this catastrophe\".

He wrote: \"When we get back in, don't be too hasty to get rid of successful election-winning leaders. \"As I never tire of telling people, some polls put us only two or three points behind, in the days before I was forced to resign in what was really a media-driven hoo-ha.\" Mr Johnson said: \"I say to my fellow Conservatives, we are the oldest, most successful political party in British history. \"We are capable of endless regeneration. We don’t need to try to absorb other parties, to try to acquire their vitality like a transfusion of monkey glands. He added: \"We need to occupy the space ourselves – and my humble suggestion to the 121 is that they need to rebuild that giant coalition of 2019, get back to some of the big themes that proved so successful that we won seats across the country.\" Some Conservatives have advocated for Mr Farage to be invited into the party, although others such as Kemi Badenoch and Tom Tugendhat have played down the suggestion. Mr Farage himself has said he does not want to be a Conservative politician, claiming the party had destroyed itself. Meanwhile Labour's new Prime Minister Keir Starmer has got straight to work, naming Angela Rayner as his deputy prime minister and Rachel Reeves as the UK's first female chancellor on Friday. Ms Rayner was among a raft of Labour MPs to arrive at Number 10 on Friday afternoon. Downing Street later confirmed she was the first appointed cabinet member, with her also taking on the role of Levelling Up secretary. Shortly after, Rachel Reeves was confirmed as chancellor, becoming the first woman to take the role in British history. David Lammy was appointed as foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper as home secretary, John Healey as defence secretary and Wes Streeting as health secretary. Ed Miliband was appointed as secretary of state for energy security and net zero, Bridget Phillipson as education secretary and Shabana Mahmood as justice secretary. The new government's first Cabinet meeting is expected to take place later on Saturday.\n",

      "The Conservatives brought out their last-minute secret weapon on Tuesday evening as Boris Johnson reunited with Rishi Sunak. It came as part of a final push before Brits head to polling stations on Thursday for the general election. The former PM was greeted by cheers, claps, whistles and chants of \"Boris, Boris, Boris\" as he made his way on stage. Read more: Rishi Sunak claims Labour would cause 'irreversible damage within first 100 days' in Downing Street Read more: 'It's not over till it's over!' Sunak seizes on England's win to insist there is still hope for Tories In an immediate jibe at Labour, he thanked attendees for \"coming so late, way past Keir Starmer's bed time\".  \t \"When Rishi asked me to come and help of course I couldn't say no,\" he said.  \t \"We're all here because we love our country.\" Mr Johnson went on to warn that a Labour supermajority would see the country \"lurch in diametrically the wrong direction\". He said those considering instead voting for Reform should \"draw back from the brink\" to stop Sir Keir's \"sledgehammer majority\". A Labour government would increase taxes and would not stand up to Vladimir Putin, Mr Johnson suggested.  \t \"They will scrap the Rwanda plan,\" he said before describing Labour MPs as \"Kremlin crawlers\".  \t Mr Johnson led the Tories to victory in 2019 against Jeremy Corbyn's Labour. He told crowds: \"They can achieve nothing in this election except to usher in the most left-wing Labour government since the war with a huge majority, and we must not let it happen.  \t \"Don't let the Putinistas deliver the Corbynistas. Don't let Putin's pet parrots give this entire country psittacosis - which is a disease you get by the way from cosying up to pet parrots.  \t \"Friends, if you actually - everybody if you actually want higher taxes next week, this year, if you feel you've got a few thousands to spare, then vote Labour on Thursday.  \"If you want uncontrolled immigration and mandatory wokery, and pointless kowtowing to Brussels again, then go right ahead, make my day, vote for Starmer.  \t \"But if you want to protect our democracy and our economy and keep this country strong abroad by spending 2.5% of our GDP on defence which Labour still refuses to commit to, then you know what to do, don't you, everybody?  \t \"There's only one thing to do - vote Conservative on Thursday my friends and I know you will. I know you will.\" Following Mr Johnson on Tuesday evening, Mr Sunak hailed the \"Conservative family united\". He claimed just 130,000 voters could help stem his party's predicted losses. It came after Survation pollsters found Labour is on course to win more seats than it did in 1997. But Labour leader Sir Keir has brushed off claims his party is on for a landslide, saying: \"Every single vote has to be earned.\" He told campaigners: \"People are saying the polls predict the future - they don't predict the future, every single vote counts, every single vote has to be earned and in places like this it'll probably go down to a few hundred either way and therefore the worst thing for people who want change is to think 'job done' and 'we don't need to vote because there's going to be a majority in any event'.  \t \"It isn't 'job done'.\" The Tory rally was one of the final events before voting takes place on Thursday. Lib Dem deputy leader Daisy Cooper described Mr Johnson's appearance as \"a desperate new low\" for Mr Sunak's campaign.  \t \"This is an insult to everyone who made heart-breaking sacrifices during the pandemic,\" she said.  \t \"Rishi Sunak has reached a desperate new low, turning to a man who discredited the office of prime minister and lied to the country time after time.  \t \"It is time to boot out this tired and sleaze-ridden Conservative party, and elect Liberal Democrat MPs who will stand up for their communities.\"\n",

      "The former prime minister, who has championed the UK's support of Ukraine, accused the Reform UK leader of spreading \"Kremlin propaganda\".  \t Mr Farage said he was not an \"apologist\" for the Russian president but \"what I have been saying for the past 10 years is that the West has played into Putin's hands, giving him the excuse to do what he wanted to do anyway\".   Johnson has accused him of \"ahistorical drivel\". Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, he said: \"Don't blame me for telling the truth about Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine. Facing up to the facts about the mistakes of the past has to be the first step towards the peaceful future we all want to see.\"  \t He added: \"I am not and never have been an apologist or supporter of Putin. His invasion of Ukraine was immoral, outrageous and indefensible.\"  \t But he added: \"Back in 2014, when the EU first offered Ukraine an accession agreement, I said in a speech in the European Parliament that 'there will be a war in Ukraine'. Why? Because the expansion of Nato and the European Union was giving Putin a pretext he would not ignore.  \t \"If you poke the Russian bear with a stick, don't be surprised if he responds. And if you have neither the means nor the political will to face him down, poking a bear is not good policy.\"  \t Mr Johnson shot back: \"Nobody provoked Putin. Nobody 'poked the bear with a stick'.  \t \"The people of Ukraine voted overwhelmingly in 1991 to be a sovereign and independent country.  \t \"They were perfectly entitled to seek both Nato and EU membership. There is only one person responsible for Russian aggression against Ukraine - both in 2014 and 2022 - and that is Putin.  \t \"To try to spread the blame is morally repugnant and parroting Putin's lies.\"  \t Home Secretary James Cleverly accused Mr Farage of \"victim blaming of the worst order\" for suggesting the West provoked Mr Putin.  \t He said it was \"completely wrong\" for a British politician to be \"echoing\" Mr Putin's justification for the war.  He told GB News: \"There is a strong track record of Western leaders and Western countries trying to bring Russia into the fold as it were, to try and show Russia and Russians that there was a peaceful, prosperous future for them.  \t \"Time and time again now we've seen Putin reject the peaceful, more prosperous options and he's waged conflict in Ukraine, Russian troops in Georgia, Russian troops in other countries around eastern Europe.  \t \"To suggest somehow that those countries brought it upon themselves, I think, is victim blaming of the worst order.\" Read more: Terror in Russia: Gunmen open fire at synagogue and Orthodox churches killing 15 police officers Read more: Flights from Manchester Airport 'expected to resume' on Sunday as travel boss apologises for mass cancellations\n",

Marr also probed Sir Keir on the behaviour of ministers while in goverment, following the revelation that Tory candidate Craig Williams placed a bet on the election. He asked him: \"How many strikes before a Labour minister who had misbehaved would be out?\" Sir Keir replied: \"One strike and you're out.  \"I know that I will be judged by my actions, not my words.  \"When I said I would tear antisemitism out of the Labour party on day one as leader, people said I like your words, but I will be judging you by your actions.  \"It's the same on trust in politics.

      "Nadhim Zahawi says that the Conservatives were wrong to oust Boris Johnson two years ago.\n",
      "In his first interview since leaving Government, Zahawi, 56, said that he and his colleagues were wrong to oust former Prime Minister Boris Johnson two years ago. He described his former boss as the most \"consequential\" Tory leader since three-term Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Read More: Boris Johnson thanks villagers who turned him away from polling station after forgetting to bring his ID Zahawi told The Times: “I wish we had held our nerve. Many colleagues got spooked. If colleagues had stepped back and just realised Twitter was not the country, we’d have probably made a very different decision.” The outgoing MP for Stratford-on-Avon also addressed the fallout of him receiving a £1million fine from HM Revenue & Customs after not paying tax due on the sale of his shares in polling company YouGov. Ahead of the release of The Boy from Baghdad: My Journey from Waziriyah to Westminster in August, the businessman turned politician said: “[What] I have tried to address … is there are no superhumans in politics. We are all fallible”  “When you come under attack your defences go up. When I look back, the mistake I made was not to be explicit about the settlement with HMRC. \"In my ministerial declaration, I should have put in what my accountants had agreed with HMRC … that it was careless, which is a category, and therefore non-deliberate, but I should have been clear that it came with a penalty attached to it. And that I didn’t [do].” Of his threats to sue in the wake of the story, the Tory MP said: “There’s no doubt that those who were challenging me and attacking me were linking it to pretty horrific things. \"They were saying ‘oh, the SFO [Serious Fraud Office] is looking at your finances’, and the NCA [National Crime Agency]. I was like ‘What the hell is this?’ — it was my mistake.” “I was answering the questions to the best of my ability. There are a lot of things that have been said about it that are inaccurate.”\n",

      "Former prime minister Boris Johnson has breached UK Government rules by being \"evasive\" about his relationship with a company that set up a meeting between him and Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro, the business appointments watchdog has said.\n",
      "Lord Pickles, chairman of the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba), has written to both Mr Johnson and Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden warning of the breach.  It comes after the former Conservative prime minister failed to clarify his relationship with a company called Merlyn Advisors, a hedge fund.  Mr Johnson is reported to have met Mr Maduro alongside Merlyn Advisors co-founder Maarten Petermann in February.  Lord Pickles wrote in his letter to Mr Dowden: \"Mr Johnson has repeatedly been asked by Acoba to clarify his relationship with Merlyn Advisors.  \"He has not done so, nor has he denied the reports in the media that he has been working with Merlyn Advisors on a non-contractual basis.\"  Government rules state former ministers must not take up new jobs or appointments for two years after leaving public office without advice from Acoba first. Read More: Boris Johnson flew to Venezuela for secret talks with president Nicolas Maduro Read More: Tory donor reveals he had to 'fight' for refund after £100,000 breakfast with Boris Johnson 'didn't materialise' In correspondence dating back to March 18, the watchdog contacted Mr Johnson's office asking him to set out his relationship with Merlyn Advisors following media reports of his South American visit.  He replied he had no contractual relationship with the company, and in further correspondence said he had not been paid for any meetings in Venezuela.  He added: \"I was extensively briefed by HMA (His Majesty's Ambassador) Caracas before the meeting and used the occasion to push for democracy, human rights and the support of Ukraine.\" Lord Pickles raised concerns that the trip was paid for by Merlyn Advisers and about the nature of Mr Johnson's activities for the company, even though he was not under any formal contract.  The peer warned: \"If that is the case, there is a reasonable concern that you were acting in a capacity that would be inconsistent with Acoba's guidance on 'one-off' speaking engagements - which does not provide blanket approval for ad-hoc advisory work.\"  Mr Johnson did not answer further questions from Lord Pickles about the nature of the meetings or his relationship with Merlyn, and said he believed it was \"clearly not necessary to consult or seek Acoba\" about the work.  But the watchdog chief disagreed and said there \"remains a reasonable concern that you were acting for Merlyn Advisors in a capacity that would be considered advisory work\", which Acoba would have expected him to ask advice for.  He added: \"Given the evasive nature of your replies, your failure to answer specific questions put to you, or provide the context of your relationship with Merlyn Advisors, the committee has formed the view that there has been a breach of the Government's business appointment rules.\"   Lord Pickles then reported the former prime minister's actions to Mr Dowden, who is also responsible for overseeing the Cabinet Office, the department which oversees the machinery of Government.  He admitted there was little action which could be taken against Mr Johnson, as the rules \"no longer have relevance in the modern world and are unenforceable to applicants determined to ignore them\".  The Government should reform the rules as it promised in July 2023, Lord Pickles said, to ensure those who breach them faces consequences.\n",

      "Liz Truss has admitted that she repeatedly pestered Boris Johnson in hospital while he was recovering from Covid-19.\n",
      "Ms Truss said that being persistent with her predecessor as Prime Minister \"was often the only way of getting things done\". She told LBC's Iain Dale that she \"just bugged\" Mr Johnson \"continually\" during his time in Downing Street, when she held multiple Cabinet posts. Ms Truss recalled one occasion during the Covid-19 pandemic, when Mr Johnson himself was hospitalised with a serious case of the virus. At the time, she was Secretary of State for International Trade, and working on the beginning of a post-Brexit trade deal with the US that needed input from the Prime Minister. Watch the full Liz Truss interview on Global Player, the official LBC app, from 7pm on Monday Ms Truss said: \"Thank God Boris was okay after Covid but I remember getting him to sign off the start of the American trade deal while he was still in hospital recovering after Covid, because his advisers weren't there.\" She added: \"It's quite bad, isn't it?\" But Ms Truss said that her persistence showed that she \"was determined to get things done.\" Ms Truss also gave the example of the Australian trade deal, which she said met with some resistance from Conservative ministers who were concerned about Australian animal welfare standards.

They're not the same as Britain. But if we're going to insist on regulatory harmony with the rest of the world, we're basically creating a big form of the EU.  \"But how did I get Boris to agree to this? Well, the answer is I got things ready, made sure there was a great deal on the table, say that it was irresistible.  \"And then I bugged him until he agreed to it.\" Ms Truss also told Iain that she believed Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey should resign over his reaction to her government's catastrophic 2022 mini-budget. Asked if she believed she was ‘stitched up’, Ms Truss said the reaction to her mini-budget represented “groupthink rather than a conspiracy”. “They believe in the current economic model Britain has, they believe in the economic consensus. They essentially believe, in my view, in managing decline,” Ms Truss told LBC. Asked if she thought Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, should retain his position, Ms Truss said: “No, I don’t.” Ms Truss also called for a “proper investigation into what happened in September 2022 and the actions the Bank took”. She resigned as Prime Minister after just six weeks in the job after her government's mini-budget crashed the pound and sent household costs soaring.\n",

      "Sir Keir Starmer has pledged his support for Ukraine “today and every day” as he spoke with Volodymyr Zelenskyy to mark the third anniversary of Russia’s invasion. \n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking via video link to a Kyiv conference, the Prime Minister reaffirmed that Britain is ready to commit British troops on the ground in Ukraine in order to maintain peace. It comes amid ever-rising tensions in Europe, with the US seemingly abandoning its support for Zelenskyy’s embattled country. \"I have a very simple, clear message today, the UK is with you today and every day, from His Majesty the King to the NHS workers volunteering in hospitals in Ukraine to the communities that took Ukrainian refugees to their heart,” the PM said. Hitting back at comments made by President Trump that Ukraine has “no cards left to play”, Starmer said: “Russia does not hold all the cards in this war. “Because the Ukrainians have the courage to defend their country. “Because Russia’s economy is in trouble. “And because they have now lost the best of their land forces and their Black Sea Fleet in this pointless invasion. “So we must increase the pressure even further to deliver an enduring peace, not just a pause in fighting.” The West can only defend Ukraine if it is united, Starmer said as he called for increased military and economic pressure on Russia. And Ukraine must be included in peace talks, Starmer said, a stark contrast to President Trump’s disregard for Zelenskyy. He said: “If we want peace to endure, Ukraine must have a seat at the table. “And any settlement must be based on a sovereign Ukraine. “Backed up with strong security guarantees. “The UK is ready and willing to support this with troops on the ground. With other Europeans, and with the right conditions in place. “And ultimately a US backstop will be vital to deter Russia from launching another invasion in just a few years’ time. “So we will do everything we can to get the best outcome for Ukraine – and for us all. “Let me close with one of those voices I mentioned earlier – A patient called Petro, from the burns unit I visited in Kyiv. “He said to me… ‘If Ukraine fails, Europe will be next.’ “That is what’s at stake here. That is why we will always stand with Ukraine, and with our allies.” It comes as Volodymyr Zelenskyy praised the \"absolute heroism\" of the Ukrainian people as his country marks the third anniversary of Russia's invasion. The Ukrainian president thanked \"everyone who defends and supports\" Ukraine, in a war that has killed tens of thousands of people on both sides. In an early morning statement on Monday, Mr Zelenskyy said: \"Three years of resistance. Three years of gratitude. Three years of absolute heroism of Ukrainians. I am proud of Ukraine! I thank everyone who defends and supports it. Everyone who works for Ukraine. \"And may the memory of all those who gave their lives for our state and people be eternal.\" On Sunday evening, Starmer and the head of Nato agreed there could be \"no negotiations about Ukraine without Ukraine\" in a call, Number 10 said. A Downing Street spokesperson said: \"The Prime Minister spoke with Nato secretary-general Mark Rutte this evening. \"Ahead of the three-year anniversary of Russia's barbaric full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the Prime Minister began by underscoring that Ukraine must be in the strongest position possible. \"The leaders agreed that there could be no negotiations about Ukraine without Ukraine. They agreed it was important for Europe to step up in order to ensure European security. \"The Prime Minister said he would continue to have these vital discussions with international partners, including during his visit to Washington DC. \"They agreed to speak soon.\" Meanwhile Starmer and France's president Emmanuel Macron are both set to meet with Mr Trump this week, and have agreed to present a united front to the US. A Downing Street spokesperson said: \"The Prime Minister spoke with President Macron this afternoon. \"They began by discussing the third anniversary of Russia's barbaric full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which is a stark reminder that we must all work together to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position at this crucial moment for global security. \"The Prime Minister repeated the UK's steadfast commitment to support Ukraine for as long as needed and reiterated the importance of Ukraine being at the centre of any negotiations to end the conflict. \"The UK and Europe must continue stepping up to meet their security needs and show united leadership in support of Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression, which they would both discuss in the US in the coming week. \"The leaders agreed to stay in close contact.\"\n",

Home Secretary Yvette Cooper had got her team \"working on closing this loophole\". Baroness Sue Carr said she was \"deeply troubled to learn of the exchanges\" between Sir Keir and Mrs Badenoch. Now, Lord Sumption has described this as an \"exceptional situation\" that \"should not have happened\". He told LBC that Baroness Carr's intervention was \"probably a mistake\".  Baroness Carr told reporters: \"I think it started from a question from the Opposition suggesting that the decision in a certain case was wrong, and obviously the Prime Minister's response to that. \"Both question and the answer were unacceptable.\"It is for the Government visibly to respect and protect the independence of the judiciary. \"Where parties, including the Government, disagree with their findings, they should do so through the appellate process.\" These comments sparked a backlash, including from senior Tories such as Michael Gove and Suella Barverman.

      "The Kremlin has hit back at proposals put forward by Sir Keir Starmer to send 30,000 troops to Ukraine, branding the plan \"unacceptable\".\n",
      "Speaking on Thursday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia would not accept such involvement, given the plan would involve NATO member forces on the ground. \"The idea of deploying troops from NATO countries to Ukraine is unacceptable for Russia,\" Peskov said, adding the move would have major ramifications for Russia's own security. It follows Sir Keir Starmer's proposal to send around 30,000 European troops to Ukraine as part of his peacekeeping effort. It's thought the Prime Minister will present his plan to Donald Trump in a bid to secure American protection for the deployment, it is understood. He has said a \"US backstop\" is needed to deter Russia from another attack. Read more: UK facing 'new era of threat' from Russia, Defence Secretary says as he unveils ‘biggest military shake up in 50 years’ Read more: ‘If you want peace, pay for it', says ex-Ukrainian PM as Starmer to 'overrule' Reeves and boost defence spending Sir Keir is expected to urge Mr Trump to have US fighter jets and missiles on standby in Eastern Europe in case Russia backtracks on any agreements made. The strategy for a \"reassurance force\" was put forward during an emergency meeting in Paris this week. Details of the Anglo-French plan are yet to be fully revealed but are understood to include putting troops in major cities away from the front line. There will be a focus on \"technical monitoring\" to ensure that Russia does not invade again, a source told the Telegraph. They said the operation would be backed by enough firepower to \"monitor and shoot those attacks down\". Other key areas will include Ukraine's air and maritime spaces, with troops set to be sent to major seaports and stations. A larger force could also be based on Nato's eastern borders to move in if necessary. \"The reason why it’s not a peacekeeping or peace enforcement or a deterrence force is the assumption that the backstop, the ceasefire, the litigations, have given you the foundation for something that might be lighter in its construct,” a Western official said. The plan falls short of the 200,000-troops Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has called for as a potential price for the peace deal. There is also opposition from Germany, Spain and Italy when it comes to sending troops to Ukraine. \"The purpose of the backstop would be to have the confidence that whatever forces are deployed will not be challenged by Russia,\" a source said. Sir Keir previously addressed the need for a security guarantee to deter Russia. He said he believes the UK can play a crucial role in peace negotiations, bridging the gap between the US and Europe. If the US signs up to the backstop, it will mean no US troops will be deployed to Ukraine after the war. It comes after a war of words broke out between Mr Trump and Mr Zelenskyy on Wednesday. Mr Trump branded Mr Zelenskyy as a “comedian” and “dictator” in a furious TruthSocial post. He hit out after the Ukrainian leader accused him of \"helping Putin to come out of isolation\" by working with him.\n",

It comes after Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he was ready and willing to put British boots on the ground as part of a peacekeeping force, a plan met with some opposition from European leaders.

On the US side, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he was \"convinced\" that Moscow was \"willing to begin to engage in a serious process\", describing today’s meeting as the “the first step of a long and difficult journey\" to ending the war in Ukraine. Meanwhile, Volodymyr Zelenskyy hit out at Russia for being blocked out Saudi Arabia talks held “behind our backs\".  Speaking following the meeting the Ukrainian leader said that such negotiations \"should not take place” if his officials are excluded. Zelenskyy has since cancelled a planned trip to Saudi Arabia, which was reportedly unrelated to the Russia-US meeting. It comes after the Kremlin said Russian President Vladimir Putin was ready to enter talks with Kyiv.  Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Putin has “repeatedly said he is ready to speak about peace” but stressed that Moscow's “wider security issues” need to be addressed first. “Putin himself said that he would be ready to negotiate with Zelenskyy if necessary but the legal basis of agreements needs discussion considering the reality that Zelenskyy’s legitimacy can be questioned,” he added.\n",

      "The most senior judge in England and Wales has sparked a backlash by launching into a rare attack on Sir Keir Starmer over migrant remarks he made in the Commons.\n",
      "During PMQs last week, Sir Keir said a decision allowing a Palestinian family the right to remain in the UK after they applied through a scheme designed for Ukrainian refugees was \"wrong\" and Home Secretary Yvette Cooper had got her team \"working on closing this loophole\". His comments drew criticism from The Lady Chief Justice, Baroness Sue Carr who said “it is for the Government visibly to respect and protect the independence of the judiciary.” But her comments have triggered a major row, with the Policy Exchange Think Tank saying she is “wrong in her attempts to ‘suppress criticism.” Richard Ekins KC, head of the Policy Exchange think tank’s Judicial Power Project, said: “This is a very ill-advised intervention by the Lady Chief Justice. “There was nothing constitutionally improper in the recent exchange by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. “Parliamentarians, including ministers, are free to disagree with judgments and to say as much. “Neither judicial independence nor the rule of law entitle judges to be free from criticism and the Lady Chief Justice is wrong to attempt to suppress criticism.” The family, who have been granted anonymity, had an appeal against the decision dismissed by a first-tier immigration tribunal judge in September but a further appeal was allowed by upper tribunal judges in January. Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch raised the case, describing the tribunal decision as \"completely wrong\". The Lady Chief Justice, Baroness Sue Carr, said on Tuesday that she was \"deeply troubled to learn of the exchanges\" between Sir Keir and Mrs Badenoch. She told reporters: \"I think it started from a question from the Opposition suggesting that the decision in a certain case was wrong, and obviously the Prime Minister's response to that. Read more: Vladimir Putin 'ready to meet Zelenskyy', Moscow says as Russia-US peace talks underway \"Both question and the answer were unacceptable. \"It is for the Government visibly to respect and protect the independence of the judiciary. \"Where parties, including the Government, disagree with their findings, they should do so through the appellate process.\" Baroness Sue Carr said she has also written to the Lord Chancellor, Shabana Mahmood, who is also Justice Secretary. Responding to Baroness Sue Carr's comments, shadow home secretary Chris Philp said politicians are \"perfectly entitled to comment on decisions by judges\". He added: \"This is especially the case with human rights-based cases, where judges have adopted increasingly bizarre and expansive interpretations of vaguely worded ECHR clauses.\" The family of six at the heart of the case brought up in the Commons - comprising a mother and father and their four children who were aged 18, 17, eight and seven in September - were displaced when their home in the Gaza Strip was destroyed by an air strike in the Israel-Hamas war. They applied for entry to the UK using the Ukraine Family Scheme to join the father's brother, who has lived in the UK since 2007 and is a British citizen, but this was refused in May last year after the Home Office concluded the requirements of the scheme had not been met. Responding to Mrs Badenoch's question, Sir Keir said: \"I do not agree with the decision. She's right, it's the wrong decision. She hasn't quite done her homework, because the decision in question was taken under the last government according to the legal framework for the last government. \"But let me be clear, it should be Parliament that makes the rules on immigration. It should be the Government that makes the policy, that is the principle, and the Home Secretary is already looking at the legal loophole which we need to close in this particular case.\"\n",

      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters the Russian leader has “repeatedly said he is ready to speak about peace” but stressed that Moscow's “wider security issues” need to be addressed first. “Putin himself said that he would be ready to negotiate with Zelenskyy if necessary but the legal basis of agreements needs discussion considering the reality that Zelenskyy’s legitimacy can be questioned,” he added. Russia would not stand in the way of Kyiv joining the European Union, Peskov continued, adding that Ukraine has a 'sovereign right' to join the bloc. \"With regard to Ukraine joining the EU, it is the sovereign right of any country, but it is completely different when it comes to security issues and military alliances. Here we have a different approach that is well known,\" he said. Putin is also ready to meet US President Donald Trump, Peskov added. He did not give a date for a potential meeting, stressing it is impossible to give any sense of the talks as they had only just begun. It comes as the Ukrainian leader was blocked out of peace talks held in at Diriyah Palace in Riyadh on Tuesday.  zelenskyy has said his country will not accept any deal negotiated without Ukrainian officials. Top US diplomats attending the meeting included Secretary of State Marco Rubio, national security adviser Mike Waltz and White House Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov was sent to lead Putin's delegation descending on Diriyah Palace, Riyadh. Yuri Ushakov, Russian aide to the president, was also present.  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday Putin was serious about negotiating a settlement to end the war in Ukraine. Ahead of the Saudi Arabia meeting, Peskov said it would be “primarily devoted to restoring the whole complex of Russian-American relations”. He added discussions will be held “possible negotiations on a Ukrainian resolution, and organising a meeting between the two presidents”.

Following the meeting, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer stressed that a US security guarantee is the only path to peace, saying a \"US backstop\" is the \"only way to effectively deter Russia from attacking Ukraine again\". He added that Ukraine is \"an existential question for Europe as a whole, and therefore vital for Britain's national interests.\" He continued: \"This is a once in a generation moment for the collective security of our continent.\" Cracks appeared in Starmer’s Ukraine peacekeeping plan on Monday night as Europe's leaders clashed over what many saw as a 'premature' pledge to put boots on the ground. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz left the crisis summit early after commenting that he was a \"little irritated\" at the Prime Minister's \"highly inappropriate\" comments. Starmer had said troops on the ground were needed to protect Ukraine - with a unified force patrolling the Ukraine-Russia border.  However, Poland, Spain, and Italy joined Germany in raising doubts over the idea. Mr Scholz said calls for peacekeeping troops was \"premature\", adding: \"I am even a little irritated by these debates, I want to say that quite frankly. \"The discussion is being held over Ukraine's head, over the outcome of peace talks that have not taken place and to which Ukraine has not said yes... \"This is highly inappropriate, to put it bluntly, and honestly: we don't even know what the outcome will be.\" Sir Keir is still expected to press his argument for US security guarantees when he flies to Washington for talks with President Donald Trump next week. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said MPs are likely to get a vote before any deployment of British troops to Ukraine.  Speaking to The Times on Tuesday, she said it would be \"normal, if circumstances allow, for Parliament to be consulted\" on military action, but added: \"I do think we are some way away from this at the moment.\" A statement from Russian Investor Dmitry Rybolovlev's family office said Mr Rybolovlev was not taking part in the US-Russia talks in Riyadh.\n",

      "German Chancellor Olaf Scholz left the crisis summit early after commenting that he was a \"little irritated\" at the Prime Minister's \"highly inappropriate\" comments. It comes ahead of US-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, with Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, and Putin aide, Yuri Ushakov, meeting with US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, national security adviser, Mike Waltz, and Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff. During the three-hour meeting in Paris, the PM said he will ensure the UK is a \"leading country\" among European nations. But as Europe descended on the Elysee Palace in Paris late on Monday to discuss Ukraine, European representatives appeared disgruntled. Calls from Starmer for troops on the ground to protect Ukraine - a unified force patrolling the Ukraine-Russia border, saw Poland, Spain, and Italy joining Germany in raising doubts over the idea. Mr Scholz said calls for peacekeeping troops was \"premature\", adding: \"I am even a little irritated by these debates, I want to say that quite frankly. \"The discussion is being held over Ukraine's head, over the outcome of peace talks that have not taken place and to which Ukraine has not said yes... \"This is highly inappropriate, to put it bluntly, and honestly: we don't even know what the outcome will be.\" It follows US president Donald Trump's push for a deal with Russia's Vladimir Putin, as the President's administration arrived in Saudi Arabia ahead of talks. Sir Keir added that the fate of Ukraine is an \"existential question\" on Monday night, adding that it is time to \"take responsibility\" for its security. He urged Donald Trump to provide a \"backstop\" to any Ukraine peace settlement, insisting it is the only way to deter Russia from attacking the country again. The PM said he would be prepared to send peacekeeping troops to Ukraine, but some present at the meeting - including German Chancellor Olaf Scholz - resisted calls for any European force being used to monitor a ceasefire.  Sir Keir said: \"We're in a very early stage of the discussions at the moment, obviously, and the most important thing as we go into these discussions is to maintain the principle of peace through strength, and what I mean by that is making sure that Ukraine is in the strongest possible position.  \t \"It would be a big mistake to think that just because there may be talks that now is the time to back down on any support for Ukraine, we need to ramp it up in my view and I've been saying that for many months now.  \t \"What we also need to do is to ensure that if there is an agreement, it is a lasting and enduring and just agreement that secures the sovereignty of Ukraine and that has to be at the heart of it.  \t \"And then, of course, the question of security guarantees.  \t \"But whether it's on security guarantees or the wider collective defence in terms of funding or capability, I think this is the moment for European countries to step up, and I am going to ensure the UK is a leading country in that endeavour.\" Sir Keir also said it is time for Europe to \"take responsibility\" for its security.  \t \"I spoke to President Zelensky on Friday and will do so again in coming days and we envisage a further meeting with European colleagues when I return from the US.  \t \"In this moment we have to recognise the new era that we are in, not cling hopelessly to the comforts of the past.  \t \"It's time for us to take responsibility for our security, for our continent and I've been clear today Britain will take a leading responsibility, as we always have, because Ukraine must have a secure future, Europe must have a secure future, Britain must have a secure future and democratic values must prevail.\" Speaking after the meeting of leaders in Paris on Monday, he said: \"At stake is not just the future of Ukraine. It is an existential question for Europe as a whole, and therefore vital for Britain's national interest. \"This is a once in a generation moment for the collective security of our own continent. Only a lasting peace in Ukraine that safeguards its sovereignty will deter Putin from further aggression in the future. \"Recent statements by the US administration should not come as a surprise.

      "James Heappey welcomed Sir Keir Starmer's commitment to put British troops on the ground as part of a future peacekeeping mission. It comes as the PM is heading to Paris this morning for an emergency summit on Ukraine's future - as the US and Russians head to Saudi Arabia for talks on a peace deal. He's said he \"doesn't take the decision lightly\" to commit British troops overseas. Read more: Peace in Ukraine 'vital for Britain's freedom', says Streeting as he backs PM's calls for troops on the ground Read more: Zelenskyy visits UAE as Starmer signals support for British troop deployment in Ukraine peacekeeping But Mr Heappey said that Britain needed to spend far more on defence to make that work. He told LBC: \"Keir Starmer's apparent commitment to troops in Ukraine as part of the post war security force is really welcome. I think he should be looking at probably a combat brigade, a combat air squadron and a commitment of probably around two warships permanently deployed in the Black Sea. That would feel like a meaningful commitment by the UK and really demonstrate the UK's leadership in this new European security order.\" And he urged the PM to keep the current troops we've committed to NATO where they are right now, with the same size of the army, navy and air force. Ministers are conducting a strategic defence review into the future of our armed forces and what they might need in future. Labour vowed to spend 2.5% of GDP on defence - but haven't put a timeline on when they'll do it. But LBC's been told they're still not agreed on how much to spend, and what to spend it on. And they're facing calls to go even higher too. Mr Heappey added: \"Whatever we want to do in Ukraine is going to require more and that means more defence spending. \"The number that is needed in order to be able to do everything that we need to do for NATO and take a leadership role in Ukraine and look after our interests globally is at least three and a half percent of GDP. \"And frankly, going to Paris and committing troops while still telling NATO that you're going to do everything that you promised them to do without making that commitment around defence spending is pretty, is pretty inconsistent and isn't going to work.\"\n",

He said: \"I do believe strongly, as does the Prime Minister, that Ukraine as the frontline, not just the Ukrainian defence freedom and security but for Britain's freedom and security as well and for the whole continent.\" Streeting added: \"What the Prime Minister is saying is that as well as securing an end to the war we need to secure the peace.\" It comes after the Sir Keir  said he is \"ready and willing\" to deploy British soldiers as part of security guarantees offered in any peace deal.  The Prime Minister said Britain - and Europe - were facing a 'once in a generation moment' for their security. Writing for The Telegraph, he revealed he believes the UK can play a crucial role in peace negotiations, bridging the gap between the US and Europe. He said: \"Securing a lasting peace in Ukraine that safeguards its sovereignty for the long term is essential if we are to deter Putin from further aggression in the future.\" Sir Keir said that he will attend an emergency summit in Paris on Monday with a \"very clear message for our European friends\". He stressed he was aware of the \"responsibility that comes with potentially putting British servicemen and women in harm’s way\". The PM continued: \"Any role in helping to guarantee Ukraine’s security is helping to guarantee the security of our continent, and the security of this country.\" He said: \"We have got to show we are truly serious about our own defence and bearing our own burden. We have talked about it for too long – and President Trump is right to demand that we get on with it. \"As European nations, we must increase our defence spending and take on a greater role in NATO. Non-US NATO nations have already increased defence spending by 20 per cent in the past year, but we must go further.\" He urged European nations to 'step up'. Starmer noted Donald Trump's peace efforts, and said: \"US support will remain critical and a US security guarantee is essential for a lasting peace, because only the US can deter Putin from attacking again. \"So I will be meeting President Trump in the coming days and working with him and all our G7 partners to help secure the strong deal we need.\" Read more: Southport killer Axel Rudakubana's sentence won't be referred to Court of Appeal despite claims it's 'unduly lenient' Read More: 'Laughing' Syrian asylum seeker who stabbed boy, 14, to death was motivated by 'Islamic terrorism' US President Donald Trump has said President Putin wants to \"stop fighting\" in Ukraine. Meanwhile, a senior Ukrainian government source has said that Kyiv has not been invited to US-Russia peace negotiations in Saudi Arabia this week. European leaders have yet to be invited to peace talks either, and will discuss their next move at the Paris summit chaired by French President Emmanuel Macron. The Ukrainian source told the BBC that no delegation would be present at the Russia-Ukraine peace talks. On Sunday, when asked about President Zelenskyy's presence at possible negotiations, Trump said: \"He will be involved\". The turbulent week of discussion comes as leaders met at the Munich Security Conference to discuss peace in Europe.  Earlier on Sunday, the former Prime Minister of Ukraine told LBC the West must be united in boosting defence spending and supporting Ukraine if it wants peace. Speaking to Iain Dale, Arseniy Yatsenyuk compared US Vice President JD Vance’s speech at the Munich defence summit to rhetoric espoused by Vladimir Putin as he pleaded with America to reaffirm its commitment to NATO and Ukraine. “Things are going in the wrong direction right now,” Yatsenyuk said. “The free world has to stay united but the latest speech by JD Vance resembles one given by war criminal Putin. “Americans have to change their approach and the way they’ve decided to handle Ukrainian and European issues, which are actually the same. “This is a huge challenge for the European Union, a huge challenge for Ukraine and a huge challenge for the United Kingdom and we have to face it,” he added. “But, I believe this could be a wake-up call for the EU and lead them to a more strong, bold and clear-cut decision. And the summit being held in Paris can jumpstart this.” Mr Yatsenyuk insisted that Europe can only have peace by investing heavily in defence.\n",

      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy arrived in the UAE late on Sunday after attending the Munich Security Conference, as speculation grows over potential peace talks to end Russia's war on Ukraine.\n",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has said he is prepared to send British troops to Ukraine as part of a peacekeeping force if a deal is reached to end the war with Russia.  He confirmed that the UK is \"ready and willing\" to support Ukraine’s security and pledged £3bn annually in military aid until 2030. His comments come ahead of an emergency summit in Paris on Monday, led by French President Emmanuel Macron. The hastily arranged meeting will bring together European leaders, including German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, and NATO chief Mark Rutte.  The discussions aim to \"bring together all partners interested in peace and security in Europe\" following US-led negotiations with Russia in Saudi Arabia, from which European leaders have been excluded. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived in the United Arab Emirates late on Sunday, following the Munich Security Conference in Germany.

The UAE has previously played a key role in prisoner exchanges and has been floated as a possible negotiation site due to its significant Russian and Ukrainian expatriate populations. Zelensky’s trip prioritises securing prisoner releases, economic partnerships, and humanitarian aid, according to his office.  However, his arrival in Abu Dhabi was not immediately reported by state media, and his agenda remains unclear.  His visit coincides with the International Defence Exhibition and Conference, where both Ukraine and Russia are displaying military hardware despite Western sanctions on Moscow. At the same time, the US and Russian officials are set to meet in Saudi Arabia to discuss potential peace talks. While a Ukrainian delegation is in the country, Mykhailo Podolyak, a top adviser to Zelensky, has publicly dismissed the idea of Ukraine engaging in negotiations, saying, \"There is nothing on the negotiating table that would be worth discussing.\" Meanwhile President Donald Trump, speaking in Florida on Sunday, claimed that Russian President Vladimir Putin \"wants to stop fighting\" and suggested he would soon meet with him to discuss a potential deal.  Trump has promised Zelensky a seat at the table, but European leaders remain uncertain about their role in the process. Zelensky’s UAE visit also coincides with Russian Deputy Prime Minister Denis Manturov’s trip to the country, where he met with UAE President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan to discuss strengthening Russia-UAE ties.  Russian money continues to flow into Dubai’s property market, despite concerns raised by the US Treasury. With European leaders pushing to shape Ukraine’s post-war future and the US engaging in separate discussions with Russia, the geopolitical landscape is shifting rapidly.  However, uncertainty remains over the direction of negotiations and Ukraine’s role in determining its own peace process.\n",

      "Speaking to LBC’s Iain Dale, Arseniy Yatsenyuk compared US Vice President JD Vance’s speech at the Munich defence summit to rhetoric espoused by Vladimir Putin as he pleaded with America to reaffirm its commitment to NATO and Ukraine. It comes amid reports Sir Keir Starmer is set to overrule Rachel Reeves and announce an increase in defence spending ahead of an emergency summit on Ukraine in Paris next week. “Things are going in the wrong direction right now,” Yatsenyuk said. “The free world has to stay united but the latest speech by JD Vance resembles one given by war criminal Putin.

And the summit being held in Paris can jumpstart this.” Mr Yatsenyuk insisted that Europe can only have peace by investing heavily in defence. “European people deserve to live in peace, the whole Second World War order is in tatters, we have to restore it. “In order to grow in a secure environment, we have to pay for this. Everyone must realise, that if we want to live in peace, we have to pay for it.” “We have to pay for our military, we have to boost the military-industrial complex and we have to make united efforts inside NATO and we are not allowed to be outplayed by war criminal Putin. “That’s why I am pleading with the United States to take their position in the game again. Otherwise, they will lose their position as the leader of the free world. “Everything depends on where the US stands on the Ukrainian war and it has to stand with Ukraine and with its European partners.” It comes as Sir Keir Starmer is set to travel to Paris next week to join European leaders at an emergency defence summit called by French President Emmanuel Macron. European allies will discuss being left out of peace negotiations between Russia and the United States over the war in Ukraine. Now, according to The Times, Starmer will overrule his chancellor and call for increased defence spending in a bid to woo Donald Trump before he flies to Washington to meet the president. Downing Street has maintained plans to boost defence spending since Labour entered power last year but has yet to give a timetable as to when they will reach their goal of 2.5% of GDP. Starmer reportedly held one-to-one meetings the Ministry of Defence on Friday, speaking with Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, the chief of the defence staff, and the respective heads of the army, RAF and Royal Navy. They want the PM to commit to raising spending to 2.65% of GDP - a move becoming ever more likely as tensions in Europe reach boiling point. Raising the MoD budget to 2.65%, however, would cost around $10billion and put a significant dent in Ms Reeves’ spending power. This comes after the PM warned of a “once in a generation moment for our national security” ahead of the emergency summit next week. Speaking on Saturday night, he said: “This is a once in a generation moment for our national security where we engage with the reality of the world today and the threat we face from Russia.\" \"It’s clear Europe must take a greater role in NATO as we work with the United States to secure Ukraine’s future and face down the threat we face from Russia. The UK will work to ensure we keep the US and Europe together.\" \"We cannot allow any divisions in the alliance to distract from the external enemies we face.” The summit is thought to be taking place in Paris on Monday. It comes as US Special Presidential Envoy for Ukraine and Russia - Keith Kellogg - has said that Europe will not have a final say in the conflict's resolution. When asked at the Munich Security Conference if Europe will be included in talks, Kellogg said: \"That is not going to happen.\" He added: \"To my European friends, I would say: get into the debate, not by complaining that you might, yes or no, be at the table, but by coming up with concrete proposals, ideas, ramp up spending.\" Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said there is \"no time to lose\". Speaking at the conference, he said: \"Europe urgently needs its own plan of action concerning Ukraine and our security, or else other global players will decide about our future. Not necessarily in line with our own interest. \"This plan must be prepared now\". Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy added: \"I believe the time has come to create an armed forces of Europe. Money alone will not stop an enemy assault. \"It is not just about budgets, it is about people realising they need to defend their own home. He went on: \"Decisions about Europe are made in Europe.\" Referencing Donald Trump's plan to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin, he continued: \"Ukraine will never accept deals made behind our backs without our involvement, and the same rule should apply to all of Europe, \"A few days ago, President Trump told me about his conversation with Putin. Not once did he mention that America needs Europe at the table. That says a lot. \"The old days are over when America supported Europe just because it always had.\"\n",

      "The planned visited to the site in Milton Keynes on Thursday was due to see the Prime Minister speak about plans to build new towns in England and promote the economy. However, within moments of his arrival, the PM's voice was drowned out by farmers' tractors sounding their horns. Around 40 tractors gathered at the entrance to the site, with the sound of Darude's \"Sandstorm\" echoing over the PM as he spoke with press. It comes just a day after farmers staged their latest protest in a series of demonstrations in Westminster against Rachel Reeves' proposed inheritance tax hike. Around a dozen agricultural vehicles were seen to block the road near the housing project, with horns heard echoing across the building site. \"Everywhere this man [Starmer] goes, we will be,\" one farmer said.

A Thames Valley Police spokesman said: \"Thames Valley Police facilitated a peaceful protest off the A509 and liaised with the protesters at the scene. \"Officers from the local policing team engaged with the protesters. \"No arrests were made or necessary,\" the force added. \"The protest has reached its conclusion and the group are now dispersing from the area.\"\n",

      "The Burnley MP was suspended by the party on Monday after former health minister Andrew Gwynne was sacked over the weekend. It follows the emergence of offensive comments made in a WhatsApp group called \"Trigger Me Timbers.\" A Labour Party spokesperson said on Monday: \"As soon as this group was brought to our attention, a thorough investigation was immediately launched, and this process is ongoing in line with the Labour Party's rules and procedures.  \"Swift action will always be taken where individuals are found to have breached the high standards expected of them as Labour Party members.\" It follows Greater Manchester Police has said that a \"non-crime hate incident\" has been recorded after a health minister was sacked over the weekend following comments made in a WhatsApp group chat.  \t Former health minister Andrew Gwynne was sacked over the weekend after the emergence of offensive comments made in the group.   According to The Mail on Sunday, the MP for Gorton and Denton sent a post saying he hoped a pensioner who did not vote Labour would die before the next election. Mr Gwynne allegedly shared a letter from a 72-year-old Stockport resident regarding bin collections, who said she did not vote for Labour, but \"As you have been re-elected I thought it would be an appropriate time to contact you with regard to the bin collections.\" The newspaper reports the minister sent an image of the letter to the WhatsApp group and said: \"Dear resident, F*** your bins. I'm re-elected and without your vote. Screw you. PS: Hopefully you'll have croaked it by the all-outs.\" Mr Gwynne also is alleged to have made anti-Semitic 'jokes' about a constituent being 'mown down' by a truck. He joked that someone's name sounded 'Jewish', saying: \"He sounds too militaristic and too Jewish. Is he in Mossad?\" The minister also made comments about MP Diane Abbott, when she stood in for then-Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn for Prime Minister's Question in October 2019. He said: \"Was David Lammy not available? I'd also take the corpse of Bernie Grant. \"Or Desmond Swayne? Justin Trudeau??\" The Mail on Sunday gained access to the closed WhatsApp group, which was started in 2019.His offensive comments included 'jokes' about Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner performing a sex act. Gwynne has become the fourth high-profile figure to leave Sir Keir Starmer's Labour Government since the party's election victory in July last year. His sacking comes after the departures of Tulip Siddiq as Treasury minister in January, Louise Haigh as transport secretary in November and Sue Gray as Downing Street chief of staff in October. Meanwhile, Oliver Ryan, the MP for Burnley who was elected last summer, has now been suspended. Taking to X on Sunday, Ryan said: \"Some of the comments made in that group were completely unacceptable, and I fully condemn them. \"I regret not speaking out at the time, and I recognise that failing to do so was wrong.\" Read more: Keir Starmer names replacement for Labour MP sacked after sending offensive messages in vile WhatsApp chat Read more: 'We will never feel true happiness again': Parents of Southport victims pay tribute to daughters as they call for change Asked if the Prime Minister expected ministers to call out derogatory remarks in WhatsApp groups, his official spokesman told reporters: \"He's made clear... his determination to uphold high standards of conduct in public office and lead Government in service of working people.  \t \"You saw the statement over the weekend, and he will not hesitate to take action against any minister who fails to meet these standards, as he has done in this case.\"  \t Asked if ministers should be calling out offensive remarks, the spokesman added: \"He set out the expectation of high standards of conduct. Obviously it is up to people to deliver on that.\"  \t The chief whip will be speaking with Mr Ryan and \"no action is off the table\", a Government source had earlier said. A Greater Manchester Police spokesperson said: \"We have received a small number of complaints relating to publicised messages allegedly from a WhatsApp group.  \t \"A non-crime hate incident has been recorded and we are in contact with our Parliamentary liaison as part of our initial enquiries.\" Now, Ashley Dalton, Labour MP for West Lancashire, has been appointed as a minister in the Department of Health and Social Care. \n",

      "His comments began a roughly six-hour meeting with his top ministers at Lancaster House in Westminster, during which he urged them to \"increase the pace of change\" against a background of global and domestic instability. During an initial political Cabinet, without Civil Service officials, the Prime Minister took aim at \"right-wing populists\" who claimed to be \"on the side of working people\" but could only offer \"grievances not solutions\", according to a readout of the meeting.  \t While he praised civil servants, he also warned that caution was \"hard-wired\" into Whitehall and called for ministers to do more to reform public services and deliver on the Government's agenda.  \t Adopting the language of Silicon Valley, he said: \"My reflection is that while we are working away the world is speeding up.  \t \"We can either be the disruptors or the disrupted.\"  \t The meeting comes as the Government finds itself still searching for economic growth amid deteriorating poll numbers, a rise in support for Reform UK and the looming threat of tariffs from the new Trump administration in Washington that could derail Labour's economic plans.  \t Read more: 'My face was swelling up like Frankenstein's Monster': LBC uncovers scores of illegal botox products being sold online Read more: Justin Welby to live at Lambeth Palace despite quitting as archbishop after report into Church safeguarding failures It also follows a Bank of England forecast, published on Thursday, that halved growth expectations for 2025, while predicting stronger growth in subsequent years and cutting interest rates.  \t Thursday's news will have been a blow for a Government with growth at the heart of its plans, and the Prime Minister began the official Cabinet session with a focus on the economy.  \t The meeting also saw Chancellor Rachel Reeves point to support for the third runway at Heathrow as a model for boosting growth - a decision that is said to have caused some friction with Net Zero Secretary Ed Miliband.  \t Mr Miliband has previously voted against a third runway, but pushed on the issue on Friday morning said he would \"abide by collective responsibility\", while stressing that any plans for a runway had to \"pass strict environmental conditions and meet our carbon budgets\".  \t Other areas touched on during the meeting included engagement with businesses, plans to reform public services and the Government's plans for artificial intelligence.

I hope that doesn't happen, but that could happen,\" Bank of England Governor Mr Bailey said.  \t \"The impacts on inflation are much more ambiguous.\" Tory leader Kemi Badenoch accused Labour of \"ruining the economy\", adding that the situation was \"worrying\".

      "Keir Starmer has insisted that a deal on the 'legal certainty' of the Chagos Islands is 'vital to national security'.\n",
      "The government is planning to hand the British Indian Ocean Territory to Mauritius but pay to lease back the US-UK military base on Diego Garcia for 99 years. It is expected to cost around £90 million a year but there are concerns that the overall price could rise to £18 billion. Speaking at PMQs, Opposition leader Kemi Badenoch said the deal was an \"immoral surrender\". \"This is money that belongs to our children and their children,\" she said. \"This is an immoral surrender so North London lawyers can boast at their dinner parties.\" But Sir Keir was quick to defend the deal, saying: \"This is a military base that is vital to our national security.\" The government argues that international legal rulings on sovereignty over the archipelago mean the UK has to cede the islands to Mauritius.

However, Mauritius is one of only two African nations not to have signed up to China’s Belt and Road Initiative and has close ties to India. Following a call with Prime Minister Ramgoolam of Mauritius last week, a Downing Street spokesperson said: \"The prime minister underlined the need for a deal to secure the military base on Diego Garcia that ensures strong protections, including from malign influence, and that will allow the base to continue to operate. \"Both leaders reiterated their commitment to a deal, and they looked forward to speaking again soon.\"\n",

      "A group of Labour trade union leaders have urged the Prime Minister and his cabinet to strengthen workers’ rights and not bow to pressure from business in their mission to grow the economy, LBC’s been told.\n",
      "General Secretaries from the Labour affiliated unions were invited to a meeting at Downing Street on Tuesday, to discuss the Employment Rights Bill. Speaking exclusively to LBC following the roundtable, General Secretary of the Fire Brigades Union Steve Wright said Sir Kier Starmer and Angela Rayner were ‘receptive’ and ‘positive’ about calls to commit to workers’ rights despite pressure to water down the bill. The Employment Rights Bill, fronted by Ms Rayner, aims to tackle work insecurity, proposes a ban on zero-hour contracts, and ‘fair pay’ for workers, among other things. Read more: Teachers in Glasgow vote overwhelmingly to strike over education cuts Read more: Man arrested after Nando's worker slapped in face with plate by customer The Conservative Party has pressured Labour to soften the bill, previously saying it would ‘crush’ companies under a ‘huge increase of new regulations’. Some business groups, including the Federation of Small Businesses and the British Chambers of Commerce, have similarly voiced concerns. Mr Wright told LBC: “Myself and general secretaries from other unions were making the point that look don't back down, don't pander to big business, that is putting a hell of a lot of pressure on the Government at the moment. “We represent 11 affiliated trade unions, we represent millions of workers across all sectors, and actually [Labour] have got our backing at the moment. “If they start delivering on these key issues like sick pay, fire and rehire, actually they’ll continue to have the backing of trade unions. “I know I'm no expert in economics, but what I do know is if you put money in workers’ pockets, that is a good thing. They will be spending money in their communities and in their high streets. “Other trade union leaders have made this point quite clearly, around the economy and putting money in workers’ pockets being fundamental, and that was the message that was made clear to the Prime Minister [on Tuesday].” When asked about the rising popularity of Nigel Farage’s Reform UK party, Mr Wright told LBC ‘delivering for working people’ will get Labour support from voters. He added: “I think it's a firm recognition of trade unions and also the Labour Party, the rise of Reform and their rhetoric, I think they'd be pretty naive not to recognise it. “But we know what Reform stands for, their position on deregulation, we know their position on workers’ rights and we know they will be no friends of working people. “What we need to see from Labour is a recognition of that, and I think the message from the trade unions is: start delivering for working people, and in my position, delivering for firefighters who do a great job in their communities, I think that's what they need to do. “Start sending a clear message and breaking down this rhetoric that Reform is coming out with.”\n",

      "Sir Keir Starmer “intends to push ahead” with the deal to cede sovereignty of the Chagos Islands, the prime minister of Mauritius has told his parliament.\n",
      "The UK announced in October it would cede control of the archipelago in the Indian Ocean, but after it had reached an agreement with the previous Mauritian government, Navin Ramgoolam insisted on renegotiating the deal when he came to power in November. Answering questions in the Mauritian National Assembly on Tuesday, Mr Ramgoolam said Sir Keir had discussed the prospect of a deal with him in a telephone conversation on Friday. He said: “The British Prime Minister informed me that he intends to push ahead with the agreement reached between Mauritius and the United Kingdom on the Chagos archipelago. “We remain confident that it will reach a speedy resolution in the coming weeks.” The prospect of a deal has caused controversy in the UK, with the Conservatives claiming it would undermine national security because of the presence of a joint UK-US military base on the largest island Diego Garcia. Giving a readout of the call, a Downing Street spokesperson said on Friday: \"The prime minister underlined the need for a deal to secure the military base on Diego Garcia that ensures strong protections, including from malign influence, and that will allow the base to continue to operate. \"Both leaders reiterated their commitment to a deal, and they looked forward to speaking again soon.\" The UK plans to lease back the strategically important base for 99 years at a reported annual cost of around £90 million. The deal could also make relations with the new administration in Washington difficult. Senior members of Donald Trump’s team expressed concern that ceding control of the islands could weaken Western influence in the Indian Ocean and strengthen the reach of China. However, Mauritius is one of only two African nations not to have signed up to China’s Belt and Road Initiative and has close ties to India. A renegotiated Chagos deal is currently being reviewed by the Trump administration.

      "Sir Keir Starmer has called on European leaders to strengthen their defences against potential Russian sabotage of vital undersea infrastructure, as the UK continues efforts to bolster the protection of its telecommunications network.\n",
      "Speaking at a European Council meeting in Brussels, the Prime Minister warned that greater co-operation was needed to counter state threats, including the security of sub-sea cables.  He told EU leaders: “We need to deepen co-operation to protect ourselves from state threats and sabotage, including on sub-sea infrastructure.” His comments come as the UK presses ahead with plans to enhance its ability to monitor and safeguard critical undersea assets.  A newly disclosed letter from Lord Coaker to Lord West of Spithead has confirmed that the UK’s first multi-role ocean surveillance ship, RFA Proteus, is part of a broader effort to secure national infrastructure, with a second vessel currently in its concept phase. Read more: Royal Navy tugboat crews balloted for strike action Read more: Rolls Royce handed £9 billion defence contract to power Britain’s nuclear submarines The letter, dated 28 January 2025, explained that “the RFA Proteus is the first of two multi-role ocean surveillance ships”, but noted that the forthcoming Strategic Defence Review would determine how best to expand these capabilities.  Lord Coaker said the government is “committed to ensuring the security and resilience of the UK’s telecommunications infrastructure” and pointed to ongoing coordination with government agencies and the subsea cable industry. In January, the Government revealed a nuclear-powered Royal Navy attack submarine was used to warn off the Russian spy vessel Yantar which was caught loitering over \"UK critical undersea infrastructure\". As Starmer pushes for closer security ties with Europe, he has also urged greater collaboration on military research and development, as well as operations such as the UK’s role in the Red Sea and training of Ukrainian troops.  He warned against fragmentation in the European defence sector, saying: “We will be more successful in building the European defence sector and contributing more to our own defence if we work together.” While the UK’s undersea defences are set to expand, the final specifications of a second surveillance vessel will depend on the Strategic Defence Review.  Lord Coaker noted that the government “constantly monitors UK territorial waters and our areas of interest to protect the nation and safeguard critical infrastructure,” with RFA Proteus already conducting survey work and using advanced remotely piloted technologies. These transatlantic cables facilitate the near-instantaneous transfer of billions of dollars in financial trades from New York, forming a critical backbone of the modern British economy. However, the world’s dependence on undersea communications also presents a significant vulnerability—over 95 per cent of global internet traffic relies on submarine cables, which remain more cost-effective than satellites, despite the rise of companies like Elon Musk’s Starlink. Russia possesses the capability to sabotage these cables and has long invested in Gugi, a covert naval intelligence agency established during the Cold War, equipped with a fleet of deep-sea submarines. Among its assets is the Yantar—named after the Russian word for \"amber\"—which serves as a key mothership for the agency. It can deploy the Pr18610, a three-man mini-submarine capable of reaching depths of up to 6,100 metres.\n",

      "Sir Keir Starmer has said Britain will not be “choosing between” the European Union and the United States after Donald Trump said tariffs will \"definitely\" be placed on EU goods.\n",
      "The American president suggested overnight he is ready to impose tariffs on both the UK and the EU after he announced 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, and 10% on China. However he said the issue “can be worked out” with Britain given “very nice” discussions with Starmer but said levies will “definitely” be placed on EU imports. Answering questions about Trump's comments, Starmer said that it's \"really important\" to work with both the EU and US and it shouldn't be seen as an \"either or\". Speaking in Brussels, he said: \"It's in the best interests of the UK and global security that we work with the EU and the US. “I've always been clear that both are important to us… We are not choosing between them.” Starmer is in Brussels to join a gathering of European Union leaders – the first time a British prime minister has done so since Brexit. He made the trip for talks on defence and security co-operation and was answering questions alongside Nato secretary general Mark Rutte. The trip is part of what Starmer calls a \"reset\" between the UK and the European Union.

I think that one can be worked out.\" Despite this threat, he said discussions with the prime minister have \"been very nice\". \"We've had a couple of meetings. We've had numerous phone calls. We're getting along very well,\" he added. However, he said tariffs will \"definitely\" be placed on goods from the EU as he said America's trade deficit with the bloc is \"an atrocity\" and \"they take almost nothing and we take everything from them\". Asked about the relationship with the US, No 10 responded earlier on Monday saying the Prime Minister trusts Trump and pointed to \"a really constructive early set of conversations\" between the two men. \"We've got a fair and balanced trading relationship which benefits both sides of the Atlantic,\" the spokesman added. \"It's worth around £300bn and we are each other's single largest investors, with £1.2tn invested in each other's economies.\"\n",

      "Steve Coogan has said he \"despairs\" of Keir Starmer's method of governing, telling LBC that the Prime Minister \"wants to be all things to all men\".\n",
      "Alan Partridge star Coogan, who is a long-term Labour supporter, told LBC's Tonight with Andrew Marr that he feared Starmer's methods might \"bite [him] on the bum\" over the course of his time in Downing Street. Coogan said that Starmer was \"a decent man\" but that British people might respect him more if he was clearer on his principles and policy positions. Starmer's government recently raised eyebrows when Rachel Reeves said the government would soften its crackdown on non-doms by making it easier for them to move money to the UK, via an increase in the temporary repatriation facility. This allows non-doms - people who live in Britain but don't pay UK tax on money made abroad - to bring money into the UK without paying significant taxes on it.Labour had earlier promised to get rid of non-dom status in their election manifesto, so this change represents a softening in their plans. Read more: Labour to soften non-dom tax changes after mass exodus of millionaires from UK revealed Read more: Prince Harry awarded 'substantial' damages as he settles privacy lawsuit against publishers of The Sun Ms Reeves said she would be making the changes to the plans after \"listening to the concerns\" non-doms had raised. Other issues that have caused divides in the party since the election have been the one-child benefit policy, and recent discussion of backing a third runway at Heathrow despite some MPs' environmental concerns. It's unclear if this is what Coogan was referring to, but he said he told Andrew: \"I'm a Labour supporter, but I do despair of the risk free, be all things to all men, approach of Keir Starmer, which I think is a fool's errand and might work in the short term, but eventually bites you on the bum for down the line.\" He compared Starmer to a loss adjuster choosing the \"least, worst, lowest risk decision\". Coogan added: \"I know that is a decent man, but I think you know you sometimes you have to... accept the fact that sometimes people respect you more when you draw a line in the sand [even] if they don't agree with you.\" The actor and comedian was speaking after Prince Harry accepted a \"substantial\" payout to settle his phone-hacking trial with the publisher of the Sun. Coogan, who was also the victim of phone-hacking by tabloid newspapers at the now-defunct News of the World in the 2000s, said that despite the payout, the dispute was not over. He urged the police to pursue newspaper senior executives and warned that if the alleged perpetrators were not taken to court \"there will inevitably be private prosecutions\".\n",

The pair discussed a wide range of issues, including the ceasefire in Gaza and economic growth. A Downing Street statement read: “President Trump opened by sending his condolences to the Prime Minister on the loss of his brother. \"The Prime Minister thanked President Trump for his kind words and congratulated him on his inauguration.

I like him a lot,\" Trump said. \"He's represented his country in terms of philosophy… I may not agree with his philosophy, but I have a very good relationship with him.\" The President added that he was considering a visit to the UK as the first international trip of his second term as president. He said: \"It could be Saudi Arabia, it could be UK. Traditionally it could be UK. \"Last time I went to Saudi Arabia because they agreed to buy $450 billion of American United States merchandise.\" Starmer released a statement congratulating Trump on his inauguration on Monday, saying the so-called special relationship between the US and UK “will continue to flourish for years to come\". Sir Keir most recently met with Trump at Trump Tower in New York during the presidential campaign. The pair also spoke on the phone following Trump's election victory in November, with Downing Street saying both men agreed the relationship between the UK and US was \"incredibly strong\" and would \"continue to thrive\". Trump’s comments mark a difference in his administration’s usual criticisms of Starmer, after Trump derided the PM for his energy strategy and Elon Musk, a key ally of his administration, over his handling of grooming gangs.\n",

      "Axel Rudakubana, 18, was sentenced to life with a minimum of 52 years in prison on Thursday for the murder of three girls and the attempted murder of eight more, as well as two adults. He killed Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine, Bebe King, six, and Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in Southport, Merseyside, in July last year. Sentencing him on Thursday, the court confirmed the killer could not be jailed for life because he was 17 at the time of the attack, despite his \"determination\" to inflict \"extreme violence\". He was just nine days short of his 18th birthday. The case has sparked calls for a change in the law, enabling whole-life orders to be imposed on under-18s in exceptional circumstances. However, the PM rule out such a move on Friday. His spokesman said a UN convention protecting children's rights means they are not allowed to be locked up for the rest of their lives.

He said: \"As you’d expect, we take our commitment to international law seriously and clearly we would take the normal range of advice on this.\" It comes after a request was made to the attorney general to have Rudakubana's sentence reviewed amid concerns it is \"unduly lenient\". Southport's MP Patrick Hurley called for him to be handed a longer sentence to ensure he dies in prison. \"In my view, the sentence passed is unduly lenient,\" he said. \"The crimes he committed were horrific and natural justice demands he spends the rest of his life behind bars. \"I have therefore made a request to the attorney general to have the sentence reviewed urgently, with a view to making sure he is never released. My community deserves nothing less.\"\n",

      "An LBC investigation has uncovered how extremists are openly using social media platforms to share violent propaganda and detailed operational manuals with content available to anyone with an internet connection.\n",
      "Our team identified several open-access channels containing this material within hours of Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer warning tougher laws could be needed to regulate the \"nightmares of the online world\" after it emerged Axel Rudakubana trawled the internet for extremely violent content before the Southport atrocity. The Prime Minister also warned Britain faces a new threat of terrorism from “extreme violence carried out by loners, misfits, young men in their bedrooms” following the Southport murders. These materials, which promote terrorism and violence with detailed instructions for attacks, and are alarmingly easy to access on open social media platforms, raising urgent concerns about content moderation and online safety. Sir Mark Rowley told LBC this morning: “We have to protect young minds from the material that is out there.  “There’s material out there that gives you tactics for using knives, building explosives. That shouldn’t be in kids’ bedrooms, but it is.” One of the most shocking discoveries is the NLM x MKU Kill Guide, a terrorism manual co-authored by two extremist groups: No Lives Matter (NLM), based in the United States, and Russia’s Maniac Murder Cult (MKU).  The guide includes tactics and techniques inspired by ISIS, providing instructions on: The guide explicitly encourages attacks on civilians and outlines steps to avoid detection by authorities, underscoring the lengths to which these groups will go to promote violence and was openly available to download. Just last week a teenage neo-Nazi Satanist who was caught with a copy of the guide and encouraged suicide online jailed for six years. Cameron Finnigan, 19, joined a satanic extremist group known as 764 in late 2023 and told one girl to hang herself \"for me\" on video so he could share it in the group's online chat, the Old Bailey heard. He was a member of two online groups which encourage increasing violence building up to potential mass casualty events, the court Old Bailey was told. On Monday the Prime Minister warned knife killer Rudakubana and those like him represented a new kind of threat, distinct from politically or ideologically motivated terrorism, with \"acts of extreme violence perpetrated by loners, misfits, young men in their bedroom, accessing all manner of material online, desperate for notoriety\". The NLM guides have been widely shared on social media and attempt to target loners and those obsessed with violence. According to a recent US Law Enforcement bulletin: \"No Lives Matter (NLM) will use encrypted messaging platforms to recruit like-minded individuals, partner with white racially motivated extremists (WRME), and publish tactical guides.\" Content LBC found being openly shared includes recruitment messages urging individuals to commit real-world acts of violence, with posts outlining requirements such as vandalism, arson, and assaults to gain membership. The group’s leaders openly encourage participants to share proof of their actions to be admitted into its ranks. While Home Secretary Yvette Cooper told MPs on Tuesday she had asked tech companies to remove the material Rudakubana looked there remains a question of how easily technology firms can find and remove content on their platforms. Swansea University's Professor Stuart Macdonald Coordinator of VOX-Pol, a leading expert on online extremism, terrorism, and regulatory responses told LBC one challenge for regulators will be dealing with content in the \"darker, more obscure parts of the online extremist ecosystem.\" Professor Macdonald said: \"For some time now, the largest social media companies have faced pressure to do more to regulate  and terrorist content on their platforms. But the problem is much wider than just the tech giants. There are many smaller and lesser known platforms that host such content. These include Telegram, as LBC’s investigation has shown, but there are also many others, from file-sharing sites and terrorist operated websites to decentralised messaging services and chat apps.\" He said research his group has carried out over the last year has \"identified terrorist content on more than 250 platforms. On some of these, the flow of propaganda faces little or no disruption, offering users stable access and the opportunity to download and share the content themselves. One of the key challenges facing regulators, including Ofcom, is to ensure that enforcement of the Online Safety Act reaches into these darker, more obscure parts of the online extremist ecosystem.\" LBC’s investigation adds weight to growing concerns about the risks posed by lone actors who self-radicalise online. These individuals often act without direct links to organised terrorist groups, but their actions can have devastating consequences. Jonathan Hall KC, the Independent Reviewer of State Threats Legislation, previously told LBC he was concerned about the threat of lone actors. The private nature of some social media channels, such as Telegram, limits the impact of moderation. A chat can have 100,000 members, but if it is set as a private private group, then no one outside will be see illegal content to report it.  The ease with which these materials can be accessed has sparked concerns, with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer describing the availability of violent content online as a “tidal wave of violence freely available.”  Starmer has called for urgent action to tackle platforms that enable extremist propaganda to thrive unchecked. This morning LBC's Nick Ferrari at Breakfast handed a full dossier of the evidence we obtained to Sir Mark Rowley the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police. This is not the first time LBC has uncovered dangerous materials on social media. In a previous investigation, we revealed how far-right groups shared bomb-making guides, homemade firearm tutorials, and addresses of Islamic centres.  The ease with which such content can be accessed shows the urgent need for stronger regulation and enforcement.\n",

      "Infrastructure \"blockers\" will have fewer chances to \"frustrate growth\" through repeated legal challenges, the Prime Minister has said.\n",
      "Sir Keir said he would end a \"challenge culture\" that saw major projects such as nuclear power plants, wind farms and roads delayed by unarguable bids for judicial review. The changes will prevent \"cynical\" or \"hopeless\" cases causing delays and increasing the cost of infrastructure projects, No10 said. Those opposing projects currently have three opportunities to secure permission for a judicial review: firstly by writing to the High Court, then in an oral hearing and finally by asking the Court of Appeal. However, under plans announced by the PM on Thursday, the written stage will be scrapped and any cases deemed \"totally without merit\" will be unable to ask the Court of Appeal to reconsider.

Shadow communities secretary Kevin Hollinrake said: \"While we welcome the Government taking forward Conservative initiatives to streamline the planning system, Labour's blocking of our efforts to cut EU legacy red tape, such as nutrient neutrality, so they can align more closely with the European Union will hold Britain back.\"  \t He also accused ministers of having \"sat on their hands\" on implementing measures to cut bureaucracy, adding that reorganising local councils was \"hardly a recipe for accelerating decision-making\".\n",

The British Prime Minister took to social media to congratulate the Republican as he spoke of the “uniquely close bond” between the United Kingdom and the United States.

Putin congratulated Trump during a meeting with members of the Russian Security Council, specifically on the incoming President’s \"desire to restore direct contacts with Russia, which were interrupted through no fault of our own by the outgoing administration.\" He added: \"We also hear his statements about the need to do everything to prevent a third World War. Of course, we welcome this attitude and congratulate the U.S. president-elect on taking office.\" Meanwhile, Zelenskyy said he looks forward to \"active and mutually beneficial cooperation\" between the two countries. \"Today is a day of change and also a day of hope for the resolution of many problems, including global challenges,\" he wrote on X. \"We are stronger together, and we can provide greater security, stability, and economic growth to the world and our two nations.\" Read more: Trump to declare border emergency, bring back 'free speech' and only recognise two genders ahead of day one orders Read more: Donald Trump insists he was 'saved by God to make America great again' as he delivers inaugural address Buckingham Palace confirmed King Charles sent a personal message of congratulations to Trump as did Pope Francis who wished the incoming President \"wisdom, strength and protection”.

      "A record number of millionaires left the UK last year, with the exodus said to have accelerated after Labour came to power in July.\n",
      "Some 10,800 people with liquid assets of over $1 million (£821,500) left the country in 2024, an increase of over 150% on 2023. A total of 78 centi-millionaires (people with $100 million or more) and 12 billionaires departed the UK last year, according to New World Wealth, a research firm. The news, coming on the back of recent turmoil in bond markets and warnings from businesses, has raised further concerns about Labour's tax plans. Millionaires are mostly moving to other European countries such as Switzerland and Italy, or to the UAE. Read more: British economy 'broadly flat' as GDP grows slightly in November after two months of contraction Read more: Sacking Rachel Reeves 'wouldn't be the right thing for the country', says Jeremy Hunt - as former Chancellor pushes for March Budget The flows of millionaires out of the country was higher in 2024 as a whole, but the increase is said to have sped up since Labour came to power in the summer. Among the factors said to be pushing millionaires to leave are Labour's plans to remove the non-domiciled tax regime that allows people to keep non-UK income in a foreign country, in exchange for a fee. Labour are getting rid of the non-dom regime from April, which Chancellor Rachel Reeves said would raise nearly £13 billion over five years. Over 70,000 people with non-dom status lived in the UK in 2023. But a survey of 700 by Oxford Economics found that nearly two-thirds were considering leaving the UK because of the change to the rules. Economic watchdog the Office for Budget Responsibility estimates that between 12% and 25% will leave after the change comes in. In contrast to Ms Reeves' comments, Oxford Economics thinks that axing the non-dom regime will end up costing the exchequer £1 billion a year. Non-dom representative group Foreign Investors for Britain told the Times that the move was \"a monumental act of national self-harm\". David Hawkins, representing the group, added: \"It appears that decisions have been made not based on the evidence but based on ideology. It’s a real worry because more and more people are leaving.  \"And it’s businesses, jobs, investment, spending into the economy and tax take and philanthropy that are hit.” A spokesperson for the Treasury said: “We are committed to tax reforms that are progressive and underpinned by fairness.  \"It is right that those who can afford to, contribute their fair share to fix the foundations to provide stability and fund public services to drive growth.”\n",

      "It has been a damp start to the week as the winter washout has brought heavy rain and flood warnings to the UK.\n",
      "14 warnings - meaning flooding is expected - are in place across the south and south west of England. The Environment Agency warned people not to drive through floods, adding that \"just 30cm of flowing water is enough to float your car\", and urging people to sign up for free flood warnings. Damp conditions brought about by the heavy rain have caused disruption for travellers with road and rail services disrupted. During the wet and blustery weekend, winds of more than 70 miles per hour were recorded in parts of Scotland and Wales on Sunday. However, tomorrow is expected to be brighter with a mixture of sunshine and light showers. Throughout the rest of the week, it will be wet and windy with heavy rain for most on Wednesday - before becoming more settled by Thursday. Transport for Wales services aren't running between Pontypridd and Tonypandy There are delays across the ScotRail network especially at Glasgow. Great Western Railway services are delayed by about half an hour between Guildford and Farnborough The roads are very wet after all the heavy rain overnight, causing havoc for motorists. Due to flooding there are long delays on the M25 clockwise from Junction 9, Leatherhead to Junction 12, M3 And in Hampshire, there are queues on the M27 Westbound to Junction 12, Portsmouth after an accident. In Greater Manchester, there are delays on the M62 Westbound to Junction 11, Birchwood because there's a load of debris across the road. In Essex, there are queues on the M25 clockwise to Junction 30, A13 because a car has broken down. Throughout the rest of the week, rain is expected in East Anglia and south east England - but with sunshine and showers expected later. Strong winds are expected the east throughout the day. The Met Office added the westerly set-up for the UK’s weather is likely to continue next week, with \"showers and possibly some longer spells of rain and windy conditions likely at times\". \"After a very mild few days, temperatures will drop back closer to average for the time of year for most places,\" the forecaster added. On Tuesday, brisk weather is expected with the threat of rain in the east of England. Otherwise, there will be sunny spells elsewhere with showers expected in the north west of the UK. Wintry conditions are likely on higher ground in the Scottish highlands. An amber weather warning was in place for rain was issued for parts of southern Wales. It remained 3pm on Sunday to 6am on Monday morning as between as up to 100mm was forecast. Flood risk alerts were also issued for the region.

I will be discussing this with Natural Resources Wales in the coming days.\" Met Office Chief Meteorologist, Andy Page, said: “We are now entering of period weather being influenced by low pressure systems from the Atlantic.  \"Strong winds and heavy rain during Sunday will bring the potential for travel disruption, dangerous conditions near coasts and the possibility of power cuts for some.” “As well as a number of yellow warnings for wind and rain we have issued an amber rain warning covering  part of South Wales.  \"Higher ground within this area could see 50 – 70 mm of rain this afternoon, evening and overnight with a few locations seeing 80 – 100 mm.  \"As this rain is falling in an area where the ground is already wet there is the likelihood it could cause some impacts.” “It is also windy with many central, northern and western parts of the UK seeing gusts of up to 50-60 mph at times, and as much as 65-75mph in exposed spots along Irish Sea coastlines, Scottish Islands, and other areas of high ground further inland.”\n",

      "The warning, issued by the Met Office on Sunday afternoon, covers areas of south and mid-Wales from Newport to Carmarthen and north to Brecon. Coming into force from 3pm on Sunday and running until 6am on Monday morning, high winds and extensive flooding can be expected in some areas. The Met Office said heavy rain was \"likely to cause some flooding and disruption later today and overnight into Monday\". Winds of up to 70mph are also poised to lash the UK, with the public advised to stay away from rivers. It added that \"fast-flowing or deep floodwater is likely, causing danger to life\", as well as possible \"delays and some cancellations to train and bus services\". The weather service said there was a \"good chance some communities will be cut off by flooded roads\" and \"homes and businesses are likely to be flooded, causing damage to some buildings\". The Environment Agency warned people not to drive through floodwater, adding that \"just 30cm of flowing water is enough to float your car\", and urging people to sign up with them for free flood warnings.

Please plan journeys carefully and do not drive through flood water - it is often deeper than it looks and just 30cm of flowing water is enough to float your car.\" The Met Office said earlier in the weekend that the UK was expected to see \"severe weather\" on Sunday, with yellow warnings issued for wind and rain before conditions improve next week.  A yellow weather warning for rain came into force in the early hours of Sunday for parts of England, Scotland, and Wales, while the south-west of England is expected to be hit by showers from midday. There is also a yellow warning for wind in place for Northern Ireland from 3am to 3pm on Sunday, and one for Scotland, Wales, and the north-east and west of England from 6am to 6pm on Sunday. The severe weather is expected to ease on Sunday night, with conditions to improve in the following days. Zoe Hutin, a meteorologist at the Met Office, said there was \"quite severe weather coming in from the west\" with \"very strong winds\" and Sunday looked \"to be the worst day in the coming few days\".\n",

      "The UK is expected to see \"severe weather\" on Sunday with yellow warnings issued for wind and rain before conditions improve next week, the Met Office has said.\n",
      "A yellow weather warning for rain will come into force in the early hours of Sunday for parts of England, Scotland, and Wales, as the south-west of England is expected to be hit by showers from midday the same day. A yellow warning for wind will also come into force between 3am and 6am for Northern Ireland and Scotland, with the Met Office warning travel disruption, minor power cuts and flooding may be possible.

Zoe Hutin, a meteorologist at the Met Office, said: \"Certainly tomorrow (Sunday) looks to be the worst day in the coming few days. \"Today (Saturday) has been decent across the country, but from around 3am tomorrow morning for Northern Ireland, and 6am for mainland UK, we've got quite severe weather coming in from the west, very strong winds. \"We've got two wind warnings in force for that, and also heavy rain, leading to some rain warnings for the South West, south Wales, and also parts of the far north-west of England and south-west Scotland. \"The wind warning itself for the mainland UK ends at 6pm, but we can expect to continue to see quite blustery conditions even into the evening as the mainland rain itself pushes through.\" Read more: Zelenskyy not ready to sign 'problematic' minerals deal with Trump The heaviest rain is expected to fall in parts of south-west Scotland and north England, whereas in the South West, up to 90 millimetres of rain may fall in some places, Ms Hutin added. \"But those rain warnings will end by midnight Sunday into Monday and thereafter, it does seem to be an improving picture,\" Ms Hutin said. \"So whilst winds will stay quite blustery for a time into Sunday evening, actually they will be gradually easing. \"By the time people get up on Monday, we'll still have some of the residual rain from that front in the far south-east of the country, and quite cloudy across England as well. \"But actually elsewhere, it could be a decent start.\" Though the weather will likely remain quite damp throughout Monday, with some hill fog in places, sunshine is expected to reappear gradually.

Temperatures from Monday are also expected to remain mild and above average, with the south of England likely to see temperatures of up to 13C and close to 10C in Scotland and the north of England. \"But then through the week, those temperatures are trending back down,\" Ms Hutin added. \"And so it will be getting cooler each day, but they will actually just be recovering to around average for the time of year. So it won't be cold. \"It will just be returning back to where we would expect to be for this time of February.\"\n",

      "The Met Office has issued five yellow weather warnings for this weekend, three for rain and two for wind. From 6am to 6pm on Sunday, southerly to southwesterly winds are expected to build across the UK. The areas affected include the west coast, Cornwall, Wales, Northern England and Scotland. Gusts between 50 and 60mph are expected, with 70mph possible in exposed places along the Irish coast. The Met Office said: \"Rain will accompany strong winds, which will make for very poor weather conditions, especially on roads.\" Read more: Live and let subscribe: James Bond producers hand franchise to Amazon after more than 60 years They advised: \"Give yourself the best chance of avoiding delays by checking road conditions if driving, or bus and train timetables, amending your travel plans if necessary. \"People cope better with power cuts when they have prepared for them in advance. It’s easy to do; consider gathering torches and batteries, a mobile phone power pack and other essential items. \"If you are on the coast, stay safe during stormy weather by being aware of large waves. Even from the shore large breaking waves can sweep you off your feet and out to sea. Take care if walking near cliffs; know your route and keep dogs on a lead.\" Northern Ireland are under another Met Office warning, from 3am to 3pm on Sunday. Cornwall have been issued a warning for rain as well - with areas between Plymouth, Torquay, Exeter and Hartland under the yellow weather band. The Met Office warned of \"heavy rain possibly leading to localised flooding and some disruption\" on Sunday, 9am to 9pm. They added that the area could expect 9-12 hours of rainfall. \n",

      "While rain and snow are predicted to continue throughout the weekend, sunshine and milder weather could return next week, the Met Office has said. Much of the UK has experienced \"anticyclonic gloom\" over the past week, causing dull skies which can \"persist day after day\", with some areas not having seen the sun in over a week. \"It's certainly a gloomy picture,\" said Met Office Meteorologist Tom Morgan.

Rain and potentially snow are expected in some places, particularly around East Anglia and Lincolnshire over the weekend, and into Scotland towards the beginning of next week. But temperatures could be much milder by the middle of the week - up to 13 or 14C - with sunshine in many places on Monday. Mr Morgan said: \"We've basically got this battleground taking place over this weekend between cold air across Scandinavia and Central Europe, which is affecting eastern part of the UK, but towards the west is a little bit milder. \"The Atlantic is trying to shift that cold air out of the way, pushing from west to east across the UK, but it's a very slow process and it will take until the middle of the coming week for conditions to turn much milder nationwide.\" He explained the gloom \"dominating\" the UK over the last two weeks has been caused by a \"large anticyclone\", or high-pressure system, which has been sitting over Scandinavia, bringing cold wind from the east. \"Those cold conditions have picked up a lot of moisture across the Baltic and North seas, and those moist conditions have led to a lot of clouds,\" he added. \"That's why we haven't seen much in the way of sunshine in most of the UK recently.\"\n",

      "Two lunar eclipses are coming to the UK's skies this year, including a 'blood moon', with the first one in only a month's time.\n",
      "The full moon will align with the sun and the Earth, in a phenomenon known as the 'blood moon'. The positioning of the sun, Earth and moon creates a cosmic light effect, as the sun's light passes through the Earth onto the moon. This means the moon will appear to have a deep red light. The 'blood moon' and 'partial lunar eclipse' will be visible on Friday 14th March at 3:57am. The maximum of the eclipse will be visage at 6:19am in London. Read more: Winning numbers revealed as single UK EuroMillions ticket holder scoops massive £65million Valentine’s Day jackpot A 'partial lunar eclipse' happens when the moon passes through the outer region of the Earth's shadow, the 'penumbra', but only a section of it passes through the darkest part of the earth shadow, the 'umbra' - according to Royal Museums Greenwich. This means that a small part of the moon will be covered by the umbra - creating an eclipse. On Sunday 7th September, there will be a total lunar eclipse. The moon will rise above the horizon at 7:33pm and have a deep red colour. Read more: Trump makes plans to meet Putin and end Ukraine war as he says 'the US wants its money back' Tom Kerss, an astronomer, from Royal Museums Greenwich, offered some tips for watching and photographing the lunar eclipse. Tip 1 - Use the right equipment Kerr assures that you don't need a telescope to take a good pouter of the Moon, but it's a good idea to use a camera with a long lens. You'll need to zoom in on the moon, so you may need a tripod to keep your image steady. Tip 2 - Know your horizon The astronomer says that, in this instance, the moon will look its best when it's lower down on the Western horizon. Therefore, try and get to higher ground, or include possible buildings in your picture. Tip 3 - Take it to the next level Kerr says it might be a good idea to take an image with a high amount of colour, to see the layers of the Earth's atmosphere on the horizon. He suggests trying 'high dynamic range photograph' that can capture not only the Moon, but the stars as well. The last lunar eclipse, in the UK, was nearly two years ago. In October 2023, a partial lunar eclipse graced our skies in Europe, Asia, Africa and Western Australia.  The last total lunar eclipse was in May 2022, where people in the UK could see the entire moon turn red, and it lasted for more than five hours.\n",

      "The Met Office has put a yellow warning in place for snow and ice tomorrow. Outbreaks of 'rain, sleet and snow' could develop on early Saturday morning from 6am to 2pm. The weather will affect areas on the east coast of England, from Newcastle upon Tyne to Hull. 2 inches of snow may fall over the North York Moors and Northumberland. Some disruption is expected, with roads and railways likely to be affected. The Met Office warns that 'wintry weather can cause delays and make driving conditions dangerous'. They warn of icy patches on untreated roads and pavements, with possible injuries from slips and falls. Regions affected include, North East England, North West English and Yorkshire & Humber.

The rare weather event is expected to bring downpours with Wales experiencing the highest risk of icy conditions and travel delays. Freezing rain is not very frequent in the UK, but it occurs when the water comes into contact with cold surfaces, turning the liquid into ice. The perilous precipitation will move across the UK in the coming days and will be at its worst over the weekend. Met Office meteorologist Alex Burkill explains how the rare precipitation develops: \"We have something a bit warmer coming in, but underneath it closer to the surface, we have some colder air plunging through, and now that's important because it brings the risk of some freezing rain... It can cause some very icy conditions and could cause some problems.\" Wale isn't the only region where temperatures are plunging. The rest of the UK is also expected to feel bitterly cold. London will warm up slightly to 5C on Sunday, getting chillier as you go up north. County Durham and North Yorkshire will feel like -6C at the beginning of next week, with Aberdeenshire feeling like -5C.\n",

The Met Office describes freezing rain as 'supercooled' water droplets, saying: \"Freezing rain tends to start its life as snow, ice, sleet or hail, but passes through a layer of air that’s above 0 °C on the way down to the ground, melting into a liquid water droplet. \"If these droplets then fall through a zone of sub-zero air just above the ground, they become supercooled.\" \"When these supercooled droplets strike surfaces that are close to or below freezing, they freeze on impact forming a glaze of ice.\"\n",

      "A Leicestershire publican who was flooded for the fourth time in 5 years says she’s considering legal action against Leicestershire County Council over a lack of action in keeping drainage systems clear.\n",
      "Jo Towle, who runs The Crown and Plough in Long Clawson, Leicestershire, has told LBC she now lives her life behind sandbags waiting for the pub to flood again. She claims the issue stems from different sections of the drainage system being owned by different individuals and authorities, with flood waters leaving her feeling trapped, on her own and unsupported by the council, who she blames for allowing her pub to flood repeatedly. Speaking to LBC from inside what used to be her restaurant, Jo said: “I just want them to do what’s right, and not just lip service.  \"We can’t see the point in paying for more equipment, new furniture and to redecorate because it’s inevitable that we (sic: the pub) will be allowed to flood again.” Explaining her frustration at the lack of action Ms Towle added: “This is known about. It’s been highlighted on council minutes for the last 25 years. There’s just never been a solution for this problem.  \"I feel that I’ve no choice but to now look at taking legal action, after banging my head against walls for years.” Read more: Warmest January on record smashes global temperatures and leaves climate scientists alarmed Read more: Dangers of social media for children 'like cancer risk of smoking', says counter-terrorism chief “I just want to be able to do my job again.

I feel like we’re letting them down – but this isn’t my fault.” Jo told LBC that despite her fondness for the pub, the feeling of isolation has taken its toll. “As much as we love being here, we don’t want to be trapped here. We can’t sell or lease it because of the flooding. We can’t retire. We are completely trapped in this business,\" she explained. “My other half has really suffered. He’s had to just concentrate on his mental health because he’s struggling with it all. Chris is a person who needs to be doing, and knowing he can’t it has been really tough on him.” “We’re still sat in a damp room, a month to the day that this building flooded. It’s a ‘Grade II’ listed building, and the council don’t seem interested in helping us protect it.” Jo made an emotional plea for better joint-work between the borough and county council: “I just want them to work together for a co-ordinated response. We’re not near a river, we’re not near a canal, we’re not on a flood plain, we’re in a 1 flood in 100 years risk area – we shouldn’t flood.” The council told Ms Towle that it was a “complicated” situation because the culvert carrying water is owned my multiple people or authorities, but she says it’s not complicated and the authority has a map marking who owns which section. LBC has spoken to a surveyor, who declined to be named, about the issues being faced in Long Clawson. They stated the council could carry out the necessary work and recover the costs from riparian owners of the culvert using their own watercourse regulation policy, but also through section 21 of the ‘Land Drainage Act 1991’. Ozzy O Shea, Cabinet Member for Highways, Transportation and Flooding at Leicestershire County Council, said: “It's in the policy that the councils can take that action, but we are the lowest funded county council in the country, we just do not have the finances to take the risk of all that legal action.  \"If the government gave us more money, then we could do things better,” she adds. Ms Towle's plea comes as Leicestershire County Council announced a million pound investment in flood protections across the county after a major incident was declared last month. The area is also set to see a cash injection from Westminster of more than 2 million pounds, shared across Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire and Leicestershire, for people affected by floods. Cllr O Shea added: “We are willing to work with the landlady and the riparian owners. If we can use any of that, one million pounds, we will use it.” “I’d like to say in the next couple of weeks we will be having conversations with those people affected in Long Clawson. We want to take this forward and make progress.” LBC has contacted The Treasury for comment.\n",

      "Cold health alerts have been issued as temperatures are set to plummet as low as minus 7C in parts of the UK.\n",
      "Yellow cold health alerts have been issued by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) for a number of areas across England including the North East, North West, Yorkshire and the Humber, and the South East from 9am on Friday until 9am on Tuesday.  Sub-zero temperatures are likely overnight for many over the coming days, with a risk of icy patches developing and a chance of snow in the south - but it is not expected to be impactful, the Met Office said.  There is also the possibility of snow, but most likely on higher ground where it could accumulate. This means the weather is likely to lead to an increased use of healthcare services by vulnerable people, and a greater risk to life of vulnerable people. It comes as a lung charity is warning people with conditions like asthma and COPD to be on their guard.  \t Stephen Dixon, spokesman for the Met Office, said: \"What we're seeing with the UK's weather over the next few days is the influence of high pressure and the development of south easterly air flow which will see temperatures drop for many.  \t \"Overnight we could see temperatures drop as low as minus 7C in rural parts of Scotland from Friday into the weekend.  \t Read more: Warmest January on record smashes global temperatures and leaves climate scientists alarmed Read more: Steve Coogan spared driving ban after plea to save new TV show \"Further south we're still likely to see through the weekend sub-zero temperatures.  \t \"Rural parts of southern Wales could reach minus 4C from Friday overnight into the weekend.\"  \t Mr Dixon said it would be a \"cold period\" but not \"historically noteworthy\". Emma Rubach, head of health advice at Asthma + Lung UK, said: \"Cold weather can be dangerous if you have a lung condition as it can bring on symptoms like coughing, wheezing and leave you struggling to breathe. This is because cold air can cause the airways to narrow, which can increase the amount of mucus produced and make breathing harder.  \t \"Cold, dry air can also irritate the airways and worsen symptoms of asthma and other lung conditions and weakens the immune system, making it harder to fight respiratory infections like colds and flu which are still doing the rounds.  \t \"We would urge anyone with a lung condition to be careful and make sure they are protected against the cold.  \t \"The most important thing to do is ensure you are using your preventer inhaler regularly as prescribed if you use one, as this builds up protection in the airways over time and always have your inhaler reliever with you, in case you do feel symptoms coming on.\" Met Office Chief Meteorologist, Paul Gundersen, said: “While some areas will see showers or some patchy rain on Friday and through the weekend, there will be the potential for some sleet or snow as temperatures drop, mostly over higher ground in central and southern areas. The cold will be accentuated at times by brisk easterly winds. “There will be variable, and at times large amounts of cloud over the coming days with the clearest and sunniest weather across the northwest of the UK.  \"There will also be icy patches and overnight frost in places. Whilst, for most, the weather is not expected to be disruptive, keep an eye on the Met Office  website for any National Severe Weather Warnings.”\n",

This is 0.1°C higher than the record set in January of last year.  The figures follow a year in which temperatures surpassed the 1.5°C threshold—an important target in climate discussions—for the first time.  The announcement has raised concerns among scientists due to the rapid pace of climate change. January 2025 was expected to be slightly cooler than the previous year, which was the hottest January on record, due to the cooling effects of the \"La Niña\" weather pattern in the Pacific.  However, last month ended up being 0.79°C warmer than the global average for January from 1991-2020 and 1.75°C higher than pre-industrial levels, according to scientists from the EU’s Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S).  This surpassed the record set in January 2024 by nearly 0.1°C.

The Met Office said Storm Éowyn was “probably the strongest storm” to hit the UK in the last 10 years. The 100mph gust recorded at Drumalbin, Scotland, was the eleventh strongest since the Met Office began naming storms in 2015. More than 1,100 flights were cancelled as winds reached a record 114mph.

      "The UK is set to be covered with snow next month as a huge blizzard will hit the country, only sparing two areas.\n",
      "As people are still reeling from Storm Eowyn, the “strongest storm” to hit the UK in the last 10 years, arctic winds will mix with low pressure from the Atlantic to create a huge blizzard. February will also see sub-zero temperatures in large parts of the country. Weather maps from WXCharts show large swathes of the country will be covered in snow once the blizzard arrives on February 11. The only areas who are currently set to be spared - Northern Ireland and the South West of England. The maps show snow will fall at the fast rate of 5 cm per hour, though some areas are expected to get more snow. The Scottish Highlands will see 21 cm of snowfall, while the area from Edinburgh to Manchester will be covered with 10 cm of snow. The Met office says: “Periods of wet weather are likely to affect northern parts of the UK at times, particularly early in this period. “Some heavy rain is possible and this is likely to be accompanied by spells of strong winds.” “South of this, across the rest of the UK, it is likely to be more settled and whilst some rain can't be ruled out at times, there is likely to be plenty of dry weather through this period. It comes after Storm Eowyn toppled more than 10,000 trees from National Trust properties, the conservation charity has said. Winds of up to 100mph on Friday, coupled with heavy rain to soften the ground, caused the loss of historically important trees across Northern Ireland and northern England. The National Trust for Scotland, a separate organisation, said each of the gardens it cares for in the south or west of the country has suffered damage. The National Trust and its Scottish counterpart have appealed for donations to pay for the clean-up and recovery operation - which will include extensive replanting. Northern Ireland, where a Red Warning was issued for the first time in its history, was worst affected by the storm. Around 10,000 trees were lost at the 900-acre site at Mount Stewart, County Down, as it blew through the formal gardens, estate and woodlands. Sheila Das, the National Trust's head of gardens and parks, said: \"Our ranger and garden teams are assessing the aftermath but it's already clear we've lost some very significant and precious trees, which is hugely sad. \"Mature trees, some with veteran qualities and important histories, give such character to our gardens and they connect us to the people who planted them, as well as playing a vital role in the ecosystems of our landscapes.\" \"We know climate change is making extreme storms like Eowyn more likely, posing a real threat to gardens and landscapes everywhere. \"Storm Eowyn reminds us that the world is changing and that we need to adapt the places we care for, to ensure that people and nature can thrive.\" Donations can be made via the National Trust website to the Climate Action Appeal: www.nationaltrust.org.uk/climate-appeal.

      "Grieving Joan Kathleen Turnell, then 77, had kept the body of her daughter Tracey in their flat in Leyton for over a year before she was discovered, an inquest heard. Neighbours had been complaining of ‘horrendous smells’ and a fly infestation. When housing association workers turned up to the property, Joan refused to let them in - so they followed her to the High Street on November 7, 2023. Joan was pushing her dead daughter Tracey in a wheelchair wrapped in a red coat. The workers said they noticed a ‘vile smell,’ and called police. Officers stopped her a short time later and found her daughter’s ‘heavily decomposed body,’ according to the Romford Recorder. At an inquest into Tracey Turnell’s death, held on Tuesday, January 28, Mr Irvine said Joan had “severe” mental health problems and had been sectioned under the Mental Health Act. A statement from Joan to the coroner read: “I kept Tracey with me because I couldn’t bear to part with her. I loved her too much.” Joan denied causing her daughter’s death and in a statement to the coroner she said: “I do not know what caused my daughter’s death.” In her statement about the day Tracey died, Joan described how they had been watching a film together. When it ended, she attempted to speak to her daughter but received no response.

Asked why it was so much worse in London than the rest of the country, he said: “Because we have a lot of shops here, and because the cost of living crisis is more acute in the capital city.” He said that use of facial recognition technology and having “good neighbourhood watch teams” were important in bringing the level of these crimes down.\n",

On Monday, the Metropolitan Police confirmed that having reviewed CCTV footage at length, officers are \"satisfied\" Mr Airlie fell accidentally, with no evidence of foul play. Detective Inspector Chris Rogers, who is leading the investigation, said: \"This new evidence means we have been able to rule out that Mr Airlie was pushed. His fall down the escalator was a very sad and unfortunate accident. \"His death, however, remains unexplained and we will continue to investigate all avenues until we can build a full picture. \"We continue to offer support to Mr Airlie's family. They have been updated by officers and we request that they receive privacy at this difficult time.\" After his fall, Mr Airlie is believed to have spoken to security officers at the station and told them he had fallen onto a woman of south Asian appearance who also fell on the escalator, police said.

Mr Airlie was wearing a black T-shirt and light grey jogging bottoms. He had a turquoise and grey Mountain Warehouse rucksack on his back and was carrying a medium-sized black suitcase. The Met said a post-mortem examination on October 29 was inconclusive and they are awaiting the result of further tests. Police initially hoped to trace the two women as part of their investigation. A post-mortem examination, which took place on Tuesday, 29 October 2024, is said to have been inconclusive. Detective Inspector Rogers said in a statement at the time: “Mr Airlie’s death is tragic, and his family continue to mourn the loss of a loving son, partner, brother and uncle. “We are determined to piece together the events, and give Mr Airlie’s family the answers they are searching for. You can assist us by coming forward with any information. However small it may seem to you, this could be the key we need to unlock the investigation.”\n",

      "The footage, which surfaced on social media, shows a man, woman and child seated at a corner table of the restaurant as they wait for their meals. A waitress then approaches to serve up their food, but as she places it on the table, the man leans over and smashes an empty plate in her face. She quickly steps back and walks away as the man shouts after her. Meanwhile, the woman at the table leans forward to stop him.  Moments later, they get up with the child and make a quick exit from the branch of the restaurant in Stratford, east London last March. The Metropolitan Police previously apologised for their handling of the case. Warning - violent and potentially upsetting footage. Viewer discretion is advised. Opening up about the incident, the waitress said in a TikTok video: \"I want to say what’s more concerning than the mass behaviour was the failure of the Metropolitan Police and their conduct. \"I was grossly let down by them. They have reopened the investigation now.\"Thanks for all of the support and the attention it’s been receiving online. And for that I’m grateful. \"However, I was really disappointed and let down with what happened at the time with the police.\" Recounting the incident, she said: \"[The man, woman and child] were sat down by a colleague. The new colleague didn't give them a high chair but usually you're supposed to ask. \"I think they assumed that they were just going to be given one anyway and that's when they got my attention – it was the lady initially and she already seemed irritated. \"They asked me for the high chair, I started bringing it but mid-way through bringing it I realised I wasn’t allowed to put it in that area because that was where we run the food.\" She continued: \"I told them I'd double-check with a supervisor, which I did. The supervisor said I'm not allowed so I relayed that information back to the couple. \"At this point, the man got quite aggressive with me. He started swearing at me, saying I’m wasting his f***ing time and to sit him somewhere the f*** else. \"At that point, I said I’d be happy to sit them in another section but to just give me a second. He said ‘you’re a little f***ing girl, why the f***do you work here? Sit me somewhere else.’ \"Then I said let me get my manager involved because I didn’t want to deal with that.\" She went on to say: \"The manager just sat him somewhere else with a baby chair. I asked why we’re still serving to the manager – I was ignored.\" The staff later noticed that the table was empty and assumed the trio had gone.But then the waitress said she was notified to go to a table in the corner of the restaurant. \"As I’m approaching this table, I notice that it’s the couple with the baby,\" she said. \"As I'm putting the food down, I ask them – because they have moved without informing anyone – ‘are you not using the high chair then?’ “It’s at that point that the man has picked up the plate and whacked me on the side of my head with it. And there was cutlery on the plate too. \"I didn't register what happened, I then remembered that police were in the restaurant so I said ‘I’m going to the police’. I walk off and go to one of the officers.” She said she originally went to a female officer who sent her to her male colleague. She pointed out the man and he was taken outside, but after being taken into the manager's office saw on the CCTV that he was allowed to go. Meanwhile, the female officer was \"having a laugh\" with the woman and child. Once police viewed the CCTV, they realised they had made a mistake, the girl said. Despite saying she wanted to press charges, she said she was told she was unable to as she would have to go in front of a jury to convince them that the incident was unprovoked. The man allegedly told the police officer that she threatened to punch him in the face. After filing a complaint with the police officers' supervisor, the girl claimed that she was told they were human and \"made a mistake\". \"The male officer called me back also and basically told me ‘I couldn’t hear or understand what you were saying and you didn’t tell me that he hit you on the head',\" she added. The Metropolitan Police said: \"We are aware of a video circulating online showing an incident in a branch of Nando's in Stratford which took place in March.

A Nando's spokesperson said: \"This was a shocking and unprovoked attack earlier this year.  \"We reported it to the police immediately and have supported our colleague since.  \"We will not tolerate this kind of behaviour, the safety of our colleagues and customers is our priority.\"\n",

      "Six people have been arrested after thousands marched in support of the far-right convicted criminal Tommy Robinson, demanding his release from prison.\n",
      "They attended a ‘Stop The Isolation’ march in Central London while thousands more staged a ‘Stand Up To Racism’ counter-protest on Saturday. Six people were arrested, the Met Police have confirmed. One person was taken into custody after an officer was spat at, while another was arrested after setting off a flare. Three more arrests were made in Westminster when Stop the Isolation protesters entered the Stand Up To Racism rally area, breaching conditions set out by police. Tommy Robinson supporters chanted ‘stop the isolation’ as they marched to Whitehall, referring to the fact that Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, is held in isolation for the duration of his prison sentence.

Robinson was jailed for 18 months in October for contempt of court charges after repeating false allegations he made against a then-15 year old Syrian refugee, admitting 10 breaches of an injunction. His supporters crossed Westminster Bridge during the rally, chanting \"We want Tommy out\" and \"We want our country back\".

A \"Stop the Boats\" flag was being carried by one protester rally in central London, while another reading \"Britain lost a patriot - RIP Peter Lynch\" was flown. Some protesters were wearing \"MEGA - Make England Great Again\" hats and others had \"I am Tommy\" stickers. Many were wearing face masks with Robinson’s face on them.

Robinson has enjoyed the support of Elon Musk, the richest man in the world, who recently faced allegations of making a Nazi gesture during an event celebrating Donald Trump’s inauguration. Musk has tweeted ‘Free Tommy Robinson!’ a number of times, and asked “Why is Tommy Robinson in a solitary confinement prison for telling the truth?” One person was seen holding up a T-shirt with \"Thank you Elon Musk\" written on it during the rally on Saturday. Robinson was the former leader and co-founder of the English Defence League, or EDL, a racist and Islamaphobic group who had links to far-right Norwegian terrorist Anders Breivik, who killed 77 people in a series of bombings and shootings in 2011. His criminal record also contains convictions for assaulting a police officer, various frauds, stalking a journalist, using a false passport, and cocaine possession with intent to supply.\n",

      "Sadiq Khan has vowed to block the third Heathrow runway \"with any tool in the toolkit\" in a rift with the government after Rachel Reeves said she would back plans.\n",
      "The London mayor told LBC's Tonight with Andrew Marr that expanding London's biggest airport would cause more air pollution and noise issues for locals, and would put the UK's climate commitments in doubt. Heathrow bosses have been trying to build a third runway for nearly 20 years amid concerns over constrained capacity at the airport, one of the world's busiest. Advocates say that expanding capacity will enable Britain to grow faster by attracting more visitors and investment - and believe that the failure to build a third runway is symptomatic of the UK's aversion to creating the necessary infrastructure for growth. Reeves, the Chancellor, said on Wednesday she would support expanding the airport as she seeks to grow the economy. But some in Labour remain opposed, largely for environmental reasons. Khan insisted that he went along with all of Labour's plans to boost the economy by building more - other than the extra runway. Read more: ‘We can go for growth and protect the environment’, Reeves insists as she hits back at Heathrow third runway critics Read more: UK jobs market ‘like after 2008 crash’, recruitment chief warns - as he urges Labour to axe national insurance hike And the Labour mayor also said that the runway would not be built until the late 2030s or early 2040s - meaning that its benefits would be delayed anyway. He insisted that he was \"pro-growth\" and \"pro-business\" and had been \"calling out for the need for government support for growth for a long time\". \"We've been frustrated by the hurdles there are to get permission for infrastructure. We've been frustrated by the difficulties in building high-quality, high-density homes around stations. We've been frustrated by the Golden Triangle of London, Oxford and Cambridge, not fulfilling its potential.\" But he said he opposed the third runway for three main reasons. \"The first reason is that the conurbation next to Heathrow is the biggest in Europe,\" Khan said. \"The numbers of people affected by noise just with two runways is more than the numbers affected by Paris, Charles de Gaulle, Amsterdam, Munich, Frankfurt and Madrid, put together that's with two runways.  \"My second concern in relation to a third runway at Heathrow is the impact on air quality. In London one of the poorest air quality areas is around Heathrow. I'm not sure how 300,000 more flights leads to better air quality.  \"And my third big concern in relation to a third runway at Heathrow is our ability to meet our climate change commitments.\" And speaking to LBC on Wednesday, Ms Reeves hit out at environmental critics of the plan as she said: “Sustainable aviation and economic growth go hand in hand.\" In her speech earlier on Wednesday, the Chancellor said the west London airport's expansion is \"badly needed\" because \"for decades its growth has been constrained\". Khan pointed out that it was up to Heathrow to bring plans for expansion, not the government.  He said:  \"Let's wait and see the plans that Heathrow bring forward in relation to a third runway.  \"The last plans they had would have meant building over the busiest motorway in the country, the M25, a tunnel underneath the M25, re-routing the A4, increasing the capacity of the Elizabeth Line, the Piccadilly Line, Southern Rail, bulldozing a village.\" He said he was \"somebody who takes tackling the climate emergency seriously, but also thinks a green transition is one of the greatest opportunities we have this century\" - adding that he would \"use any tool in the toolkit to stop a third runway happening.\"\n",

      "Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has said Rachel Reeves \"hasn't a clue\" about how to generate growth in aviation, and building a third runway at Heathrow is a ‘dead cat’, after the chancellor pledged her support for the plan.\n",
      "O'Leary said the Chancellor should scrap air passenger duty (APD) rather than \"waffle on\" about the Heathrow expansion, which he described as \"a dead cat\" that would not happen before the 2040s at the earliest. In a speech on growth in Oxfordshire on Wednesday, the Chancellor said the west London airport's expansion is \"badly needed\" because \"for decades its growth has been constrained\". The scheme would involve around seven years of construction to produce a third runway and a new terminal, and would require more than 700 houses to be demolished and the M25 motorway to be moved into a tunnel. Environmental groups have expressed major concerns over the impact of airport expansion on climate change, as it will bring higher levels of pollution and noise to the capital. Read more: Cleared for take off: Chancellor backs plans for 'badly needed' third runway at Heathrow Airport in 'fight' for growth Read more: UK jobs market ‘like after 2008 crash’, recruitment chief warns - as he urges Labour to axe national insurance hike But in her budget in October 2024, Reeves announced increases in APD from the 2026/27 financial year, which means it will rise from £13 to £15 for those travelling in economy on a short-haul flight. Mr O'Leary described APD at £15 as \"insane\" as it represents \"a rate of tax of 33% on Ryanair's average ticket price\". Mr O'Leary told a press conference: \"The UK continues to lose out on enormous growth opportunities because you have a Chancellor who hasn't a clue about how to deliver growth. “[She] has had five years to get ready for it, and yet has managed to screw it up in her first budget.\" \"Nothing is designed to damage growth faster than increasing taxes on air travel,” he added. The Irish businessman said his company could deliver 50% more passengers to the UK if the tax is scrapped, which would deliver growth in the aviation industry.

The thing that will deliver growth is abolishing APD.\" He went on: \"Here's the prize we've offered to Rachel Reeves. We deliver about 60 million passengers a year to the UK. \"Within five years, we could grow that by 50% to 90 million passengers, and all she has to do is abolish APD.\" This would cost the Government £4 billion which would be \"paid back two-fold within 12 months\" because of growth in passengers, he said. Representatives of other airlines have welcomed the announcement. EasyJet boss Kenton Jarvis said: “As an island nation, this industry provides much-needed connectivity as well as creating many skilled jobs which contribute to the wider prosperity of the country. “Expansion at Heathrow will provide consumer and economic benefits and represents a unique opportunity for easyJet to operate from the airport at scale for the first time and bring with it lower fares for consumers.” A Virgin Atlantic spokesperson said: \"Heathrow is critical national infrastructure and the UK's only hub airport, enabling connectivity and trade to global markets, yet it remains the world's most expensive airport with a service that falls short. \"We are supportive of growth and expansion at Heathrow, if, and only if, there is fundamental reform to the flawed regulatory model to ensure value for money for consumers, affordability for UK plc and support for a competitive UK aviation industry.\" GMB regional organiser Perry Phillips said: \"The Heathrow third runway expansion has finally been cleared for take-off. \"We welcome the Government's decision and the thousands of good, unionised jobs and apprenticeships the project will create. \"The project represents a huge boost for construction skills in this country, which will be vital for future infrastructure projects.\"\n",

      "Two environmental activists have been arrested after disrupting a production of Shakespeare's The Tempest starring Sigourney Weaver on Monday.\n",
      "Mother of three Hayley Walsh, 42, and mechanical engineer Richard Weir, 60, can be seen walking on stage where Alien star Weaver is performing, in a video shared to social media by Just Stop Oil, the climate protest group. Carrying a sign that reads \"over 1.5 degrees is a global shipwreck\", the pair launched a confetti cannon while announcing \"we'll have to stop the show ladies and gentlemen, sorry\". Weaver, 75, who had been sitting on a chair, was escorted off stage at the Theatre Royal in Drury Lane on Monday, while the two protesters faced boos and a few cheers from the audience. Police have confirmed that they arrived at the venue after the protesters had left, and that a 42-year-old woman and a 60-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of aggravated trespass.

The sign references the recent announcement that 2024 was the warmest year on record globally and the first full year when the average temperature exceeded 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Ms Walsh, 42, a lecturer from Nottingham, said: \"I am scared for my children, I can't sleepwalk them into a future of food shortages, life-threatening storms and wars for resources. \"Years of writing to MPs, going on marches and teaching my students to be more sustainable hasn't seen the urgent change needed. \"1.5 degrees is a global shipwreck we can't ignore. Wildfires in California, deadly floods in Valencia and hundreds of thousands without power in the UK this weekend. \"This isn't a distant, future problem.

      "Mother of three Hayley Walsh and mechanical engineer Richard Weir can be seen walking on stage where Alien star Weaver, 75, is performing, in a video shared to social media by Just Stop Oil, the climate protest group. Carrying a sign that reads \"over 1.5 degrees is a global shipwreck\", the pair launch a confetti cannon while a voice says \"we'll have to stop the show ladies and gentlemen, sorry\". Weaver, who had been sitting on a chair, was escorted off stage at the Theatre Royal in Drury Lane on Monday, while the two protesters faced boos and a few cheers from the audience. The sign was a reference to the recent announcement that 2024 had been the warmest on record globally and the first full year when the average temperature exceeded 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.

He is due to appear at Ealing Magistrates' Court on January 27. The arrest came after the case was flagged by Met Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley on Friday during an exclusive phone-in with LBC's Nick Ferrari at Breakfast. Shop owner Paige called in to speak directly with Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley and ask for an update on her case, with the Commissioner taking her details and promising an update. During the segment, Nick Ferrari told Sir Mark there was a perception officers wouldn't be interested in investigating a theft if it was for an item valued at less than £250. However, the Commissioner refuted this, stating that officers \"want to know about all crime.\" He also said he was out with officers the day before who were \"dealing with crimes of that nature. They were picking up the high-profile offenders, the prolific offenders who are going out of multiple shops and committing crime.\" McKenzie has also been charged by Surrey Police with theft from a store owned by the same business in Oakdene Parade, Cobham, on January 13.

      "The Metropolitan Police has been removed from special measures, following an improvement in its performance - despite the watchdog finding it was failing in most areas in August.\n",
      "The Met was put into the 'enhanced monitoring' phase by the watchdog, His Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services (HMICFRS), in 2022 after a series of scandals. Those included the murder of Sarah Everard by serving police officer Wayne Couzens in 2021, and failures investigating the killings committed by serial killer Stephen Port. A new commissioner, Mark Rowley, was hired to oversee the force in 2022 and vowed to turn its fortunes around. But just last summer the watchdog said the Met was failing in almost every area. And last month Rowley admitted that proposed budget cuts would mean the force would have to ‘scale back’ its ability to tackle serious violence and organised crime Listen to Met Police commissioner Mark Rowley on LBC's Nick Ferrari at Breakfast on Friday, on Global Player.

His Majesty’s Inspector of Constabulary Lee Freeman said: “I am pleased with the good progress that the Metropolitan Police Service has made so far.  \"Whilst there is still a significant amount of work to do I have recommended removing the service from our enhanced level of monitoring, known as Engage, and return it to routine monitoring.  \"I am reassured by the plans that the commissioner has put in place to continue making sustainable improvements.  \"We will continue to monitor the progress of the Metropolitan Police Service to make sure those living and working in the capital are getting the service they deserve from their force.” Sadiq Khan, who has overall responsibility for policing in the capital, said he welcomed the change. “This is down to the hard work of the Commissioner, Deputy Commissioner, Met officers and staff, who are rebuilding public confidence and trust in the force, as well as record investment and support from City Hall,\" the mayor added.  \"Emergency calls are now being answered faster, vetting is being strengthened and neighbourhood policing is being revitalised. \"Having asked [the watchdog] to look in particular at concerns around child sexual exploitation, it's reassuring that the Met Police have made significant improvements in this area, including around missing children and victim blaming language. “There’s still more to do, and as Mayor, I’ll continue to work with the Commissioner to ensure we drive through the further improvements needed as we build a safer London for everyone.”\n",

      "The London Fire Brigade said around 60 firefighters tackled the fire which erupted in a first floor flat in Upper Norwood on Wednesday morning. Seven people were rescued using ladders and had been treated at the scene by the London Ambulance Service. A statement read: “Eight fire engines and around 60 firefighters have been tackling a fire at a block of flats on Church Road in Upper Norwood. “Part of the first floor was alight. Seven people were rescued from the building by firefighters using ladders and were treated on scene by London Ambulance Service.” The LFB said a 32-metre turntable ladder was used to fight the fire, which was first reported around 3.30am, in Church Road from above. Crews from West Norwood, Woodside, Norbury and surrounding fire stations were among the eight engines to attend the scene. The blaze is now under control, the LFB confirmed. It comes after four people were arrested after a fire at a ski resort hotel in Turkey left at least 76 people dead. Ali Yerlikaya told reporters 'our pain is great' as he described the toll of the devastating fire at the Kartalkaya resort around 170 kilometres (100 miles) northwest of the capital Ankara. He said at least 51 other people had been injured from the fire. Four people have since been arrested by Turkish authorities, including the business owner, the justice secretary confirmed. The fire broke out at around 3.30am on Tuesday in the restaurant of the 12-storey Grand Kartal hotel in the resort of Kartalkaya in Bolu province, officials and reports said. The cause of the fire is under investigation.\n",

      "Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and MP John McDonnell agreed to be interviewed under caution by police following a pro-Palestinian rally in central London on Saturday.\n",
      "Police said a group of protesters, led by Jeremy Corbyn, John McDonnell, holocaust survivor Stephen Kapos and political activist Lindsey German, 'forced their way through a police line'. Corbyn, 75, the former Labour leader and current MP for Islington North, and McDonnell, 73, who represents Hayes and Harlington, denied this, and Corbyn described it as \"not an accurate description of events at all.\" Both men have reportedly agreed to be interviewed by police after arrests were made at a pro-Palestine rally. The MPs, who were pictured at the Palestine Solidarity Campaign (PSC) protest on Saturday, both sit in Parliament as independents. The Metropolitan Police said three men, aged 75, 73 and 61, had agreed to attend voluntarily at a police station in central London to be interviewed under caution on Sunday afternoon. Responding to a claim by the police that the protesters ‘forced their way through’ police lines, Corbyn said: “This is not an accurate description of events at all. “I was part of a delegation of speakers, who wished to peacefully carry and lay flowers in memory of children in Gaza who had been killed. “This was facilitated by the police. We did not force our way through.” In the post on X, Corbyn called for the police to release their bodycam footage of the events, and “retract its misleading account of events.” John McDonnell also responded to the Metropolitan Police’s post, and said: “I spoke at demo & was part of a procession of speakers aiming to go to BBC to lay flowers commemorating the death of Palestinian children. “We did not force our way through, the police allowed us to go through & when stopped in Trafalgar Square we laid our flowers down & dispersed. McDonnell said he had a conversation with a police officer where he explained their intention, and called for that police officer to release their bodycam footage. He added: “Regrettably, soon after I had explained to the police officer our intentions & we awaited the arrangements to lay the flowers, bizarrely the police violently arrested one of the march stewards, who was organising the presentation of the flowers & the dispersal of the crowd.” Corbyn declined to comment when contacted by the PA news agency. Mr McDonnell has also been approached for comment. Nine other people have been charged with public order offences following the protest. The Metropolitan Police arrested 77 people at the protest - the highest number across more than 20 national PSC protests since October 2023. Some 65 people were detained for a breach of conditions, five for public order offences, two for obstructing police, one for supporting a proscribed organisation, one for inciting racial hatred, one for common assault, one for assault on an emergency worker and one for sexual assault. The force said on Sunday that 24 people have been bailed and 48 remain in custody. Mr Corbyn's brother Piers Corbyn, 77, of Elephant and Castle, south-east London, has been charged with a public order offence. Eight other people have been charged with public order offences. They will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court in the coming days, police said. Commander Adam Slonecki said: \"Yesterday we saw a deliberate effort, including by protest organisers, to breach conditions and attempt to march out of Whitehall. \"This was a serious escalation in criminality and one which we are taking incredibly seriously. Officers have worked around the clock to pursue those involved.\"\n",
