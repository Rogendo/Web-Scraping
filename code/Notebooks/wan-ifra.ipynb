      " Speaking at our recent Bangalore AI Forum, Suresh Vijayaraghavan, Chief Technology Officer at The Hindu, detailed the publication’s AI journey – highlighting the challenges of moving from standalone experiments to full-scale integration within editorial and production workflows.“AI in isolation is innovation, but AI in production is transformation,” Vijayaraghavan said, underscoring the need for seamless AI integration rather than relying on fragmented tools.From siloed systems to an integrated platformFor over a decade, The Hindu has adopted various digital tools, including e-paper platforms, paywalls, SEO systems, social media automation, and recommendation engines. However, these systems operated independently, creating inefficiencies in editorial workflows.By 2020, the company launched a three-year digital transformation to unify its CMS, analytics, and AI-powered tools into a single integrated platform. The system, completed in 2023, enables journalists to track article performance, analyse audience engagement, and access AI-driven features – all within the CMS.“We must avoid repeating past mistakes – building AI tools in isolation, only to spend years integrating them later,” Vijayaraghavan warned.The Hindu is deploying AI across multiple editorial and production areas, including headline and summary generation, SEO optimisation, content translation, video and audio generation, and archival system integration.These AI-driven tools assist journalists rather than replace them.“Journalism is the final product. AI can help streamline processes, but the essence of journalism remains human-driven,” he said.Key technical challenges in AI integrationVijayaraghavan highlighted several key challenges in scaling AI from experimentation to production. These include aligning AI with existing business processes, handling real-time data inconsistencies, ensuring model accuracy, and addressing security risks.Business process alignmentIntegrating AI into The Hindu’s content creation, publishing, and archival workflows requires a structured approach. AI tools must:Seamlessly interact with the CMS, paywalls, and digital archives.Be optimised for different content formats – text, images, video, and audio.Have intuitive UI/UX within the newsroom workflow so that journalists can access AI assistance without disrupting their process.Real-time data integration and inconsistenciesAI models require live data stream access, but real-world newsroom environments present challenges such as:Inconsistent metadata across different publishing systems.Delayed updates between CMS, analytics, and archival platforms.Managing real-time performance to ensure AI-generated insights are instantly available rather than requiring manual data processing.The Hindu is also experimenting with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to enhance its archival search.“We are working on a RAG-based experiment where our archival system, 147 years of our archive, is going to be tagged by a model. As I create an article, the model understands the context and suggests related archival articles in real time,” Vijayaraghavan said.Performance and scalabilityFor AI to be production-ready, it must deliver results quickly and efficiently. Key challenges include:Inference speed: Ensuring AI models return outputs instantly, without slowing down newsroom workflows.Optimising AI deployment: Deciding between cloud, on-premise, or edge computing to balance cost and performance.Scalability: Ensuring AI can handle high workloads, especially during breaking news coverage.While AI has streamlined workflows, its direct financial impact is still uncertain.“My developers are good. Now they get a code coming to them very fast, but it has not improved the bottom line. That means there is no measurable impact to the bottom line because of what you’re doing,” Vijayaraghavan said.Model drift and continuous learningAs AI models evolve, they can produce inconsistent or biased outputs over time. To maintain reliability, The Hindu is implementing:Automated retraining pipelines to keep AI models up to date.Feedback loops to fine-tune AI-generated summaries, headlines, and recommendations.Editorial oversight mechanisms to ensure AI aligns with The Hindu’s journalistic standards.One of the participants during the Q&A round.Security, compliance, and governanceAs AI governance continues to evolve, The Hindu is addressing risks related to security, compliance, and ethical AI usage. Key concerns include:Cybersecurity risks such as AI model poisoning, where bad actors manipulate AI-generated outputs.AI audit trails: Tracking how AI modifies content to ensure transparency.Regulatory compliance: Adhering to GDPR and India’s DPDPA to maintain data privacy and ethical AI practices.Bias detection analytics: Ensuring AI does not reinforce systemic biases in news coverage.“These challenges must be addressed at every stage of AI implementation to ensure that AI enhances, rather than disrupts, newsroom operations,” Vijayaraghavan saidAI integration strategy: A unified approachTo ensure sustainable AI adoption, The Hindu follows a three-pronged strategy.A unified AI architecture ensures AI tools are seamlessly embedded within the CMS, supporting content creation, publishing, and analytics while avoiding workflow disruptions.AI governance and compliance ensures AI-generated content aligns with editorial policies and regulatory standards such as GDPR and India’s DPDPA. This includes implementing bias detection analytics to prevent systemic biases in reporting.Industry collaboration and AI research is a key focus, as The Hindu’s CMS is provided by a Danish vendor used by multiple publishers. The company has joined a publisher-led AI advisory consortium to guide CMS development.“This collaboration ensures that AI integration benefits all publishers using the platform,” Vijayaraghavan noted.This consortium helps shape CMS-level AI developments, ensuring that newsroom-friendly AI features – such as audit trails and seamless CMS integration – are developed collaboratively.While AI-driven analytics can optimise news production, Vijayaraghavan cautioned against over-reliance on AI-generated trends.“If we rely only on AI trends, we become followers, not leaders. Journalism should surprise readers with what they didn’t know they wanted to read,” he explained.He also addressed the ongoing challenge of audience engagement in the digital era.“Direct traffic from loyal readers – those who have bookmarked our site – is crucial. At the same time, we must navigate the reality that a significant portion of traffic still comes via search,” Vijayaraghavan said.

       "('by Cherilyn Ireton cherilyn.ireton@wan-ifra.org | March 3, 2025',\n",
       " 'Founded in 1989 as the voice of Lech Wałęsa’s Solidarity movement, Gazeta Wyborcza was originally launched to cover Poland’s first partially free elections. Owned by Agora, today it stands as the country’s largest national and digital newspaper, one of Europe’s most influential news brands, and a beacon of independent journalism. Over the past decade, it has been at the forefront of a fierce battle for democracy and independent journalism, resisting sustained interference from the conservative Law and Justice party, which took full control of public media during its eight-year rule.Donald Tusk’s election as Prime Minister last year eased some of the pressure on the press, but Poland’s political future remains uncertain, with a presidential election looming – just two weeks after our Congress takes place. Like much of Europe, the country is also navigating a shifting geopolitical landscape, particularly in relation to its neighbours, Ukraine and Russia.WAN-IFRA: What lies ahead for the media in the region, particularly Gazeta Wyborcza?Roman Imielski: From my perspective the most important thing is fighting disinformation and fake news. It’s spreading across the world and especially our region, demolishing our democracy and civil society. Many people and global players try to weaken journalism and say: “Hello, everybody has their own truth, don’t believe traditional media.” Of course this smear campaign has an impact on our business, readership and credibility, especially among young people.As the top executive editor – formally, First Deputy Editor-in-Chief – you lead a newsroom of 250 journalists. What are the biggest strategic challenges you’re currently focused on?For me the biggest challenge is dealing with Big Tech. We need good regulation about Google or Facebook in the European Union. They should treat us fairly – as a media partner and important part of healthy democracy. It’s obvious for me that Big Tech should pay more than pennies for using our material. In the end, we should create new models of cooperation with Big Tech, focused on direct traffic to our websites.Investigative journalism is a core strength of Gazeta Wyborcza. Beyond that, what do you believe sets your reporting and product apart?Yes, we are very proud of our investigative journalism. But this is only one pillar of our strategy. The other is local reporting – we have dozens of journalists across Poland, in smaller cities, because we try to be very close to our readers’ problems. International affairs is very important, and we had big success last year – gaining more readers and more subscribers. The next are psychology topics – for example life work balance or good relations with friends – and women’s rights. But the most important are our values and mission. I still believe in very good journalism, without clickbait. And still believe that people are more important than algorithms.With technology reshaping the media landscape, how is your newsroom adapting to digital transformation and AI-driven changes?As I said, for us people are more important than algorithms. But every day we are adapting to the digital world, especially the AI environment. We would like to use good tools of AI and technology to strengthen our journalism and to reach new groups of readers. One of the most important challenges is effective and reasonable personalisation.Looking back, which recent projects are you most proud of, and why?I think our most important project in recent years was to survive eight years of the anti-liberal and populist government of Law and Justice. We were attacked every day by politicians and their propaganda channels as liars, enemies of the Polish nation and members of conspiracy schemes. Because we were pure journalists and an independent watchdog of the ruling party, we unveiled many corruption and political scandals. It was very hard to work at that time, and we did our best to protect our team, values and journalistic mission.\\xa0As Poland navigates political shifts and regional tensions, what concerns you most about the future of independent journalism?I’m afraid that anti-liberal populists can win elections in Poland and will try to silence independent media – by introducing new laws or applying financial pressure, by vocal attacks on journalists and editors, by spreading fake news and disinformation. Right now, we have big problems with hate speech on social platforms against our staff and many journalists feel very uncomfortable and harassed.Is there any message you would like to share with those who will travel to Krakow for Congress?I wish everyone a good time in this beautiful and historical Polish city. And hope that our Congress will be very fruitful, full of new and excellent ideas for journalism.Gazeta Wyborca’s parent, Agora, is the Strategic Partner for our World News Media Congress, which runs from 4-6 May in Krakow.Roman Imielski will chair a session at the World News Media Congress on May 5 entitled: Rethink your future newsroom. All of it. Registerfor the Congress. Share via:    Facebook      Twitter      LinkedIn       More   Cherilyn Iretoncherilyn.ireton@wan-ifra.org')"
