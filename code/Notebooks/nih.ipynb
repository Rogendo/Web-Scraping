         "  \n A clinical trial supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is testing an experimental treatment designed to help people suffering the effects of dengue, a mosquito-borne viral disease. The study is supported by NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), and will involve exposing adult volunteers to a weakened strain of dengue virus that causes a mild form of the disease and administering an investigational therapeutic at various doses to assess its safety and ability to lessen symptoms. Dengue is transmitted via infected Aedes mosquitoes and sickens as many as 400 million people each year, primarily in tropical and subtropical parts of the world, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2024, dengue cases surged to record levels in the Americas with local U.S. transmission reported in Arizona, California, Florida, Hawaii, and Texas. Dengue is endemic in Puerto Rico, which reported nearly 1,500 cases last year. Most people with dengue do not develop symptoms, but those who do commonly experience severe headache and body aches, nausea and vomiting, fever and rash. One in 20 people who get sick with dengue progress to severe illness, which may lead to shock, internal bleeding, and death. There is currently no Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment for dengue. “When caring for a patient who is critically ill with dengue, healthcare providers have few options other than providing supportive care,” said NIAID Director Jeanne Marrazzo, M.D., M.P.H. “We must find safe and effective therapeutics to provide much-needed relief to people suffering from dengue.” The new clinical trial will test the ability of AV-1, an investigational human monoclonal antibody therapeutic developed by AbViro (Bethesda, Maryland), to mitigate clinical symptoms when administered before and after dengue virus infection. The results of a previously completed NIAID-supported Phase 1 trial indicated that AV-1 is safe in humans, providing the basis for the new clinical trial to test its safety and efficacy. The Phase 2 clinical trial will enroll at least 84 healthy adult volunteers at two sites: the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health Center for Immunization Research in Baltimore, and the University of Vermont Vaccine Testing Center in Burlington. Following an initial screening and physical examination, volunteers will be randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group will receive AV-1 one day prior to being challenged with a mild strain of dengue virus, and the other will receive AV-1 four days after being challenged with the dengue virus. Each group will be further subdivided to receive 100 mg, 300 mg, or 900 mg of AV-1, delivered in a 60-minute intravenous infusion. For each of the three dosage levels, 12 participants will receive the investigational monoclonal antibody, and two will receive a placebo. Before or after AV-1 dosing, each volunteer will receive an injection of attenuated (weakened) dengue virus. In earlier studies using this challenge virus, most volunteers developed a rash, and some had other mild dengue symptoms, such as joint and muscle pain or headache. None of the volunteers developed dengue fever or severe dengue. Volunteers will participate in regular follow-up visits with study staff for at least 155 days to carefully monitor the effects of the investigational monoclonal antibody. Through physical exams, diary cards and blood samples, researchers will document how the volunteers’ immune systems respond to the dengue virus challenge, how quickly the virus vanishes from their bloodstream and any symptoms they may experience. The researchers will use this information to determine how AV-1 affects the volunteers’ ability to recover from dengue compared to placebo and to determine the dosages at which AV-1 may be effective. If AV-1 shows promising results in this clinical trial, researchers may pursue further clinical evaluations of its safety and efficacy against dengue virus.

National Institutes of Health (NIH) scientists and their colleagues report that a single dose of a broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb) administered prior to virus exposure protects macaques from severe H5N1 avian influenza. Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 viruses have sporadically spilled over from birds into many other animals, including humans and dairy cows, in recent years. Although it has not yet acquired the capacity to spread readily between people, H5N1 has pandemic potential, which has spurred efforts to develop effective treatments and other countermeasures. The investigators studied a bnAb called MEDI8852, which was discovered and developed by Medimmune, now part of AstraZeneca. MEDI8852 targets a portion of a key flu protein that is less prone to change than other parts of the virus and thus is capable of conferring protection against a wide range of flu viruses. In the new study, a group of macaques received an injection of MEDI8852 and were exposed to aerosolized HPAI H5N1 virus three days later. All the pre-treated animals survived and experienced no or very limited signs of disease. In contrast, a group of control macaques developed severe or fatal illness within a short time after virus exposure. Of note, the scientists determined that MEDI8852 remained in the body for a prolonged time after the injection. According to scientists, protection from severe disease would extend to weeks beyond antibody infusion, providing a realistic preventative window in the face of an H5N1 outbreak. The research was conducted by Masaru Kanekiyo, D.V.M, Ph.D., and colleagues from NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Vaccine Research Center (VRC) along with investigators from the University of Pittsburgh.

         "  \nFindings highlight the importance of infection prevention measures and personalized heart failure care. A study funded by the National Institutes of Health has found that adults who were hospitalized for a severe infection, such as respiratory infections or sepsis, were more than twice as likely to develop heart failure years later. The findings, published in the Journal of the American Heart Association, underscore the importance of measures that help prevent severe infections, such as getting up-to-date vaccines and practicing safe hygiene. “These are ‘sit-up and take notice’ findings,” said Sean Coady, M.A., deputy branch chief in the Division of Cardiovascular Sciences at the NIH’s National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. “While there’s already a reasonable body of evidence linking previous infections with heart attack, this study is focused on heart failure, which has been less studied yet affects an estimated six million Americans.” The study, part of the NHLBI-funded Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study, followed 14,468 adults aged 45-64 for up to 31 years, from 1987 to 2018. None had heart failure when the study began. The researchers found that individuals who experienced an infection-related hospitalization had a 2.35 times higher risk of developing heart failure at an average time of seven years after surviving the hospitalization, compared to those who did not get an infection. The researchers adjusted for sociodemographic and health-related factors and included different infection types, such as respiratory, urinary tract infections, and hospital-acquired in their assessment. They found that the association with heart failure was consistent no matter the type of infection. Heart failure occurs when the heart is unable to pump enough blood to the body’s organs and tissues. While there are many different kinds, the study focused mainly on heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), which occurs when the left side of the heart is too stiff to fully relax between heartbeats, and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), which occurs when the left ventricle is too weak to pump out enough blood to the body. The researchers discovered that infections that required hospitalization were associated with an increased risk of both conditions. Notably, the risk was nearly three times higher for HFpEF, the most common form of heart failure among people over age 65 and the one with the most limited treatment options. Nearly half of participants experienced an infection-related hospitalization emphasizing the potentially large impact of severe infections on the heart health of older adults. While the study only found an association between severe infections and heart failure – not a causal link – Ryan Demmer, Ph.D. professor of epidemiology at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. and the study’s senior author, said patients still should consider commonsense approaches that keep severe infections at bay. He explained that someone who experiences an infection and are at high risk for cardiovascular disease should speak with their primary care provider to be sure they are receiving guideline directed medical therapies for cardiovascular disease. Demmer said future research could build on the current findings by validating a causal link between infections and heart failure development. New research could also explore the potential for incorporating infection history into heart failure risk assessments and patient management strategies.

Influenza A virus particles strategically adapt their shape—to become either spheres or larger filaments—to favor their ability to infect cells depending on environmental conditions, according to a new study from National Institutes of Health (NIH) scientists. This previously unrecognized response could help explain how influenza A and other viruses persist in populations, evade immune responses, and acquire adaptive mutations, the researchers explain in a new study published in Nature Microbiology. The study, led by intramural researchers at NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), was designed to determine why many influenza A virus particles exist as filaments. The filament shape requires more energy to form than a sphere, they state, and its abundance has been previously unexplained. To find the answer, they developed a way to observe and measure real-time influenza A virus structure during formation. The researchers found: Prior experiments by the research team showed that influenza A virus filaments can resist inactivation by antibodies, and the team is working to understand exactly how antibodies influence shape and infection efficiency. They also anticipate learning how viral mutations affect the shape of the virus. Many other viruses – such as measles, Ebola, Nipah, Hendra and respiratory syncytial virus – also incorporate a mixed-shape infection strategy, the researchers note. E Partlow, et al.

         "  \nNIH trial informs potential treatment strategy for kids who already tolerate half a peanut or more. Eating gradually increasing doses of store-bought, home-measured peanut butter for about 18 months enabled 100% of children with peanut allergy who initially could tolerate the equivalent of at least half a peanut to consume three tablespoons of peanut butter without an allergic reaction, researchers report. This easy-to-implement treatment strategy could potentially fulfill an unmet need for about half of children with peanut allergy, who already can tolerate the equivalent of at least half a peanut, considered a high threshold. The findings come from a trial sponsored and funded by the National Institutes of Health’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and published today in the journal NEJM Evidence. “Children with high-threshold peanut allergy couldn’t participate in previous food allergy treatment trials, leaving them without opportunities to explore treatment options,” said NIAID Director Jeanne Marrazzo, M.D., M.P.H. “Today’s report focuses on this population and shows that a very safe and accessible form of therapy could be liberating for many of these children and their families.” The food allergy treatments currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration were tested in children with low-threshold peanut allergy, who cannot tolerate the equivalent of even half a peanut. These treatments are designed to decrease the likelihood of a reaction to a small amount of peanut despite efforts to avoid it, as might occur with accidental exposure. This approach is not relevant to the estimated 800,000 U.S. children who may have high-threshold peanut allergy, leaving them with only one management strategy prior to the new report: peanut avoidance. To address this need, researchers tested whether a low-cost, convenient treatment strategy could help children with high-threshold peanut allergy tolerate a much greater amount of peanut protein than they already did. The mid-stage trial involved 73 children ages 4 to 14 years. Based on parent or guardian report, nearly 60% of the children were white, 19% were Asian, 1.4% were Black, and 22% were more than one race. The study team assigned the children at random to either test the new treatment strategy or continue avoiding peanut. Those in the peanut-ingestion group began with a minimum daily dose of 1/8 teaspoon of peanut butter. They gradually increased their dose every eight weeks up to 1 tablespoon of peanut butter or an equivalent amount of a different peanut product, such as peanut flour or candies. Dose increases took place under medical supervision at the study site. None of the children in the peanut-ingestion group needed epinephrine to treat severe allergic reactions during home dosing, and only one child needed epinephrine during a supervised dosing visit at the study site. After undergoing the treatment regimen, the peanut-consuming children participated in an oral food challenge carefully supervised by the study team to see how much peanut butter they could eat without an allergic reaction. All 32 children who participated in the challenge could tolerate the maximum amount of 9 grams of peanut protein, the equivalent of 3 tablespoons of peanut butter. By contrast, only three of the 30 children in the avoidance group who underwent the oral food challenge after a similar amount of time in the trial could tolerate 9 grams of peanut protein. Three additional children in the avoidance group tolerated a challenge dose at least two doses greater than the amount they could tolerate at the start of the study. The trial took place during the COVID-19 pandemic, and some families preferred to avoid indoor close contact with others at that time, so some children did not return to the study site for the oral food challenge. Using a common statistical technique to account for those missing challenge results, 100% of the ingestion group and 21% of the avoidance group tolerated at least two doses greater than they could at the outset. Children in the peanut-ingestion group who could tolerate 9 grams of peanut protein during the oral food challenge consumed at least 2 tablespoons of peanut butter weekly for 16 weeks, then avoided peanut entirely for eight weeks. At that point, they were asked to return to the study site for a final oral food challenge. Twenty-six of the 30 treated children (86.7%) who participated in the final challenge continued to tolerate 9 grams of peanut protein, indicating they had achieved sustained unresponsiveness to peanut. The three children in the avoidance group who could eat 9 grams of peanut protein without a reaction at the earlier challenge were considered to have developed natural tolerance to peanut. Analyzing these outcomes and including all 73 children who began the trial, regardless of whether they participated in the final challenge, investigators found that 68.4% of the peanut-ingestion group achieved sustained unresponsiveness, while only 8.6% of the avoidance group developed natural tolerance.      Based on these encouraging results, the investigators want to learn if the same treatment strategy would work for food allergens other than peanuts. Future follow-up is needed to determine the therapy’s effectiveness at inducing long-lasting tolerance of peanut. Scott H. Sicherer, M.D., and Julie Wang, M.D., led the trial, which took place at the Elliot and Roslyn Jaffe Food Allergy Institute in Mount Sinai Kravis Children’s Hospital, New York.
