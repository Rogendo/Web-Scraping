The end goal of these campaigns, in some cases, is to redirect the email recipient to a phishing page.\\n\\nFurthermore, it has emerged that CSS offers opportunities for threat actors to monitor user behavior via spam emails by embedding CSS properties such as the @media CSS at-rule, thus opening the door to potential fingerprinting attacks.\\n\"This abuse can range from identifying recipients\\' font and color scheme preferences and client language to even tracking their actions (e.g., viewing or printing emails),\" Mirzaei explained.\\n\"CSS provides a wide range of rules and properties that can help spammers and threat actors fingerprint users, their webmail or email client, and their system. For example, the media at-rule can detect certain attributes of a user\\'s environment, including screen size, resolution, and color depth.\"\\nTo mitigate the risk posed by such threats, it\\'s recommended to implement advanced filtering mechanisms to detect hidden text salting and content concealment, as well as use email privacy proxies.\\n\\n\\nFound this article interesting?
