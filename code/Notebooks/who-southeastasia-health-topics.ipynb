In addition to opportunities for development this transition poses risks to their health and wellbeing. Contrary to popular perception that this is a health age group, the adolescents do have several public health issues.There were an estimated 1.7 million deaths among adolescents in 2015 in the Region; the leading causes of mortality included self-harm (suicide), road injury and maternal mortality (among women). In addition, significant morbidity is reported among adolescents in the Region – a loss of 21\\xa0783 Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) per 100\\xa0000 adolescents owing to self-harm, iron deficiency anaemia, depressive disorders, road traffic injuries and diarrhoeal diseases.

It is with good reason that many have long considered them ‘wonder drugs’. The emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is creating ‘superbugs’ that make treating basic infections difficult (and in some cases impossible) and surgery risky. And though the emergence of resistance in microorganisms is a continuous phenomenon, its amplification and spread are the result of one thing: human behavior.The WHO South-East Asia Region is particularly affected. As WHO-conducted risk assessments have shown, the Region is likely the most at-risk part of the world. Not only does AMR affect the health and well-being of people across South-East Asia, but it also has ramifications for public health and well-being more broadly. As recent history demonstrates – and as this exhibition highlights – in our interconnected world the potential for superbugs to travel is real, making the issue of immense global significance. The Region has been pro-active in combating the problem. As early as 2011 the Region’s health ministers called for concerted action against AMR via the Jaipur Declaration on Antimicrobial Resistance. WHO continues to assist Member States implement it. In 2014 the battle against AMR was made a Flagship Priority. We continue to support Member States pursue it. And in 2015 the Regional Committee passed a key resolution on AMR’s prevention and control. All 11 Member States of the WHO South East Asia Region have developed national action plans to address AMR.

It is rooted in gender inequality and has with significant negative consequences on women’s physical, mental, sexual and reproductive health. The share of women experiencing such violence over their lifetime is large. The South-East Asia Region has the second highest rate of lifetime prevalence of intimate partner violence (33%), according to the recent report ‘Violence against women estimates, 2018. Global, regional and national estimates for intimate partner violence against women and global and regional estimates for non-partner sexual violence against women’ (and its Executive Summary) released by WHO and partners. Public health measures to control the spread of COVID19 – such as restrictions of movement– have increased the risk of exposure to gender-based violence for women and girls and limited their ability to distance themselves from their abusers and access needed services. As WHO-SEARO Regional Director Dr Poonam Khetrapal-Singh said, “Violence against women is not only a grievous violation of the human rights of women and girls; it is also a priority public health issue, with serious consequences for the health and well-being of victims and survivors, their families and their communities. The health sector needs to play its part in responding to and preventing all forms of violence against women and girls.” WHO is joining its partners to participate in the annual campaign, the 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence, observed to highlight the extent of this challenge and strengthen policies and actions to end it. The activist-led campaign commences on 25 November, the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, and ends of 10 December, Human Rights Day. The 2021 theme is: “Orange the World: end violence against women now!” During the 16 Days, WHO is partnering with UNFPA’s Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific to train health facility managers and policy-makers in three countries—Bhutan, the Maldives and Sri Lanka—in strengthening health sector capacity to respond to VAW, through a series of 6 online workshops. Studies show that women who experience violence are more likely to seek health care, even if they don’t disclose the associated violence or abuse; and that women identify health-care providers as the professionals they would most trust with disclosure of abuse. Health care providers therefore need to have the required competencies to respond to the needs of survivors in health settings; the health care system needs to be equipped to provide the best possible care for survivors. On 30 November, WHO will partner with UN Women’s and UNFPA’s Regional Offices for Asia and the Pacific to host an online event to disseminate the updated prevalence estimates on intimate partner violence and sexual violence in the Region. The event will also discuss how better data could be used to strengthen policies and actions to eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls. As the 16 Days Campaign marks its 30th anniversary this year, national governmental organizations and line-ministries, national women’s machineries and commissions as well non-governmental organizations and women-led organizations will participate in the campaign along with WHO and UN partner agencies.\\n'}, {'Topic': 'Health data and health information systems', 'Link': 'https://www.who.int/southeastasia/health-topics/health-statistics-and-information-systems', 'Content': '\\nMonitoring health situations and trends is one of WHO’s six core mandates and underpins evidence-based decision making in every facet of health systems strengthening.

Leprosy is known to occur at all ages ranging from early infancy to very old age. Leprosy is curable and early treatment averts most disabilities.TransmissionThe exact mechanism of transmission of leprosy is not known. At least until recently, the most widely held belief was that the disease was transmitted by contact between cases of leprosy and healthy persons. More recently the possibility of transmission by the respiratory route is gaining ground. There are also other possibilities such as transmission through insects which cannot be completely ruled out.Seeking skin lesions, Brazil, 2015 ©WHO/PAHOSigns/symptoms and diagnosisClinical signs are easy to observe. In a country or area with a high incidence of leprosy, an individual should be regarded as having leprosy if he or she shows ONE of the following cardinal signs:skin lesion consistent with leprosy and with definite sensory loss, with or without thickened nervespositive skin smearsThe skin lesion can be single or multiple, usually less pigmented than the surrounding normal skin. Sometimes the lesion is reddish or copper-coloured. A variety of skin lesions may be seen but macules (flat), papules (raised), or nodules are common. Sensory loss is a typical feature of leprosy. The skin lesion may show loss of sensation to pin pick and/or light touch. Thickened nerves, mainly peripheral nerve trunks constitute another feature of leprosy. A thickened nerve is often accompanied by other signs as a result of damage to the nerve. These may be loss of sensation in the skin and weakness of muscles supplied by the affected nerve. In the absence of these signs, nerve thickening by itself, without sensory loss and/or muscle weakness is often not a reliable sign of leprosy.Leprosy can be classified on the basis of clinical manifestations and skin smear results. In the classification based on skin smears, patients showing negative smears at all sites are said to have\\xa0paucibacillary leprosy (PB), while those showing positive smears at any site are said to have\\xa0multibacillary leprosy (MB).TreatmentLeprosy is curable with a combination of drugs known as\\xa0multidrug therapy\\xa0(MDT), as the treatment of leprosy with only one anti leprosy drug (monotherapy) will result in development of drug resistance to that drug. The combination of drugs used in the MDT depends on the classification of the disease.\\xa0Rifampicin, the most important anti leprosy medicine, is included in the treatment of both types of leprosy.

To individuals, the failure to enjoy adequate levels of physical activity increases the risk of cancer, heart disease, stroke, and diabetes by 20–30% and shortens lifespan by 3–5 years.Insufficient physical activity is one of the leading risk factors for death worldwide, including in the WHO South-East Asia Region, where NCDs cause around 8.5 million deaths every year, many of them premature. Though the Region has a relatively young population, the prevalence of NCDs is increasing mortality, particularly among populations who disproportionately suffer from them. Moreover, physical inactivity burdens society through the hidden and growing cost of medical care and loss of productivity.Increasing physical activity requires a whole of society and culturally relevant approach and therefore demands a collective effort across different sectors and disciplines. All age groups can benefit from regular muscle-strengthening exercises.\\xa0\\xa0 Children aged 5-17 require at least 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous-intensity daily aerobic activity. Adults aged 18-64 need 150 to 300 minutes of moderate-intensity weekly aerobic activity. Older persons aged 65 and above require at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity weekly aerobic activity. All Member States have incorporated specific points on the promotion of physical activity into national multisectoral NCD action plans and implemented innovative measures to promote physical activity in schools, workplaces and public spaces. All countries are committed to achieving the global target of reducing physical inactivity by 10% by 2025 and 15% by 2030, for which they are leveraging the Global Action Plan on Physical Activity 2018-2030 and its ACTIVE toolkit.\\n'}, {'Topic': 'Poliomyelitis (polio)', 'Link': 'https://www.who.int/health-topics/poliomyelitis', 'Content': 'Error'}, {'Topic': 'Primary health care', 'Link': 'https://www.who.int/southeastasia/health-topics/primary-health-care', 'Content': '\\nThe 2018 Astana Declaration states that primary health care (PHC) includes three inter-related components:• Primary care and essential public health functions as the core of integrated health services;• Multi-sectoral policies and actions; and• Empowered people and communities”PHC existed in the South-East Asia Region well before the 1978 Alma Ata Declaration on Primary Health Care, and indeed helped shape it.

It is spread to people and animals through bites or scratches, usually via saliva. Once clinical symptoms appear, rabies is virtually 100% fatal.Rabies is estimated to cause 59 000 human deaths annually in over 150 countries, with 95% of cases occurring in Africa and Asia. Due to underreporting and uncertain estimates, however, this number is likely a gross underestimate. The burden of disease is disproportionally borne by rural poor populations, with approximately half of cases attributable to children under 15 years of age. In up to 99% of cases, dogs are responsible for rabies virus transmission to humans.In the South-East Asia Region, rabies is endemic in 9 countries – Bangladesh, Bhutan, DPRK, India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Thailand.Elimination of dog-mediated rabies as a public health problem is feasible through vaccination of dogs and dog population management, prevention of dog bites and ensuring universal access to post-exposure immunization. Effective human vaccines and immunoglobulins exist to prevent human rabies. Immediate wound cleansing and immunization within a few hours after contact with a suspect rabid animal can prevent the onset of rabies and death. Vaccinating dogs, supported by effective dog population management, is the most cost-effective strategy for preventing rabies in people. Globally it has been shown that control of canine rabies can be achieved with sustained dog vaccination coverage of 70%.\\xa0\\n'}, {'Topic': 'Reproductive health', 'Link': 'https://www.who.int/southeastasia/health-topics/reproductive-health', 'Content': '\\nReproductive health is a state of complete\\nphysical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or\\ninfirmity, in all matters relating to the reproductive system and to its\\nfunctions and processes.
