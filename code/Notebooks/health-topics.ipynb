      "There are 25.6 million people living with HIV in the African region.East and Southern Africa – 20.8 millionWest and Central Africa – 4.8 millionIn 2022, about 380,000 people died from AIDS related illness in 2022.760,000 newly infected with HIV in 2022HIV infection is often diagnosed through rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), which detect the presence or absence of HIV antibodies. Most often these tests provide same-day test results, which are essential for same-day diagnosis and early treatment and care.Key populations and their sexual partners accounted for over half of all new infections (an estimated 54%) for the first time in 2018.Key populations include: men who have sex with men, people who inject drugs, people in prisons and other closed settings, sex workers and their clients, and transgender people. They are at increased risk of HIV infection irrespective of epidemic type or local context.Key populations, their clients and sexual partners accounted for 64% of new HIV infections in West and Central Africa, and for 25% of new HIV infections in the East and Southern African subregion. Key populations and their partners accounted for around 95% of new HIV infections in eastern Europe and central Asia and in the Middle East and North Africa in 2018.Key populations often face legal and social barriers that increase their vulnerability to HIV and impede their access to prevention, testing and treatment programmes.There is no cure for HIV infection. However, effective antiretroviral (ARV) drugs can control the virus and help prevent transmission so that people with HIV and those at substantial risk, can enjoy healthy, long and productive lives.It is estimated that currently 79% of people with HIV know their status. In 2018, an estimated 23.3 million people living with HIV were receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) globally.Between 2000 and 2018, new HIV infections fell by 37%, and HIV-related deaths fell by 45% with 13.6 million lives saved due to ART in the same period. This achievement was the result of great efforts by national HIV programmes supported by civil society and a range of development partners.\n",

      "No effective cure for HIV exists at present but HIV can be suppressed by a combination of medicines called antiretroviral (ARV) therapy consisting of three or more ARV drugs. Antiretroviral therapy does not cure HIV infection but suppresses viral replication within a person's body and allows an individual's immune system to strengthen and regain the capacity to fight off infections.People with HIV can enjoy long, healthy lives by taking ARV treatment.In 2021, WHO released the Consolidated guidelines on HIV prevention, testing, treatment, service delivery and monitoring: Recommendations for a public health approach. These consolidated guidelines on preventing and treating HIV infection bring together a series of recommendations to promote the highest quality, person- centered delivery of care for people living with HIV and affected by HIVConsolidated guidelines on HIV prevention, testing, treatment, service delivery and monitoring: Recommendations for a public health approachHIV still causes too many avoidable deaths, but by providing the right health services in a timely manner, we can avoid the worst consequences of the virus. The recommendations in these guidelines aim to reduce the number of people dying from HIV and, when fully implemented, will help us to reach our goals of reducing global HIV deaths to less than 200 000 by 2030. For most people living with HIV, it is a chronic, lifelong condition. Evidence and lived experience have shown that with the right support, people are able to manage their own health according to what works best in their lives. The service delivery approaches put forward in these guidelines aim to promote self-management for the majority of people living with or affected by HIV. This includes an expanded range of options for diagnosing, preventing, and treating HIV that are delivered and monitored in the community.Treatment and care in children and adolescentsIn the African region, an estimated 1.3 million children aged 0-14 were living with HIV at the end of 2022, and 109 000 children were newly infected. An estimated 69 000 children died of AIDS-related illnesses. To reduce HIV-related mortality and morbidity among this highly vulnerable population, early testing and treatment is essential. Without access to testing and treatment, 50% of children with HIV will die by the age of 2, and 80% will not live to their fifth birthday.WHO recommends that infants born to mothers living with HIV are tested for HIV, at birth, six weeks, during breastfeeding, and when breastfeeding ends given the continued risk of transmission during this period. Older children, especially offspring and siblings of persons infected with HIV, should also be tested. HIV-positive children should be started on antiretroviral drugs (ARV) immediately. Once treatment begins, children must take their medicine regularly to stay healthy into adolescence and adulthood. Failure to suppress the HIV virus remains a serious problem among children, aggravated by a lack of child-friendly formulations of the newest and most effective ARVs designed for adults.Compared to other populations, adolescents face additional barriers in accessing testing and treatment, including health services that are not adapted to their needs and policies that require parental consent for services. HIV-positive adolescents also are less likely than adults to adhere to their treatment regularly, resulting in lower rates of viral suppression and lower declines in mortality.Addressing the distinct and diverse needs of adolescents living with HIV to improve their HIV-related outcomes requires a comprehensive and integrated approach that leverages on global commitments and approaches to adolescent health, including the Global Strategy for Women, Children, and Adolescents’ Health (2016–2030) and the Global Accelerated Action for the Health of Adolescents (AA-HA!).WHO recommends the implementation of adolescent-friendly health services in HIV services to ensure engagement and improved outcomes. Involving and engaging in their own care across the treatment cascade and through the cycle of planning, implementing, monitoring and evaluating programs is key. Peer-driven, adolescent-friendly services, integrated with other services including psychosocial interventions, are effective ways to improve health outcomes for adolescents.AIDS-free framework to accelerate paediatric and adolescent HIV treatmentHIV Drug ResistanceTens of millions of HIV/AIDS patients have had their lives saved thanks to the extraordinary rise in the use of antiretroviral medication (ART) during the last ten years. Of the estimated 25.6 million people living with HIV in the African region, 20.8 million were on antiretroviral therapy (ART) as of the end of 2022. HIV drug resistance has emerged in tandem with the growing usage of HIV medications; in recent years, the prevalence of this resistance has been progressively rising. Changes in the genetic makeup of HIV impact the medications' capacity to prevent the virus from replicating, leading to HIV drug resistance. Due to the advent of newer kinds of antiretrovirals, all currently available medications have the potential to become partially or completely inactive.Drug-resistant virus strains have the potential to render all antiretroviral medications, including those from more recent classes, partially or completely inert. HIV drug resistance has the potential to compromise antiretroviral medication effectiveness if it is not addressed, leading to a rise in HIV infections as well as higher rates of morbidity and mortality related to HIV.Guidelines on the public health response to pretreatment HIV drug resistanceWHO releases HIV drug resistance report 2021 •    WHO urges action against HIV drug resistance threatPrevention of HIV drug resistanceWHO recommends assessing whether antiretroviral therapy (ART) programmes are delivering services at the quality required, to minimize the emergence of HIV drug resistance. This assessment is achieved with a set of standard quality-of-care indicators known as “early warning indicators” of HIV drug resistance. The early warning indicators use standardized definitions, which have evolved over time as programmes mature and public health actions are refined.

The roles and responsibilities of network laboratories, recommended testing, internal and external quality assurance procedures, and assay validation recommendations are summarized in the WHO/HIVResNet HIV drug resistance laboratory operational framework.Minimum criteria for external quality assurance proficiency tests for use by laboratories designated by WHO for HIV drug resistance surveillanceTarget product profile for HIV drug resistance tests in low- and middle-income countries: AfricaWHO manual for HIV drug resistance testing using dried blood spot specimensWHO HIVResNet HIV drug resistance laboratory operational framework HIV drug resistance surveillanceGlobal and national policy decisions on antiretroviral therapy and HIV service delivery need to be informed by reliable national data on HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) prevalence and trends. HIV treatment and pre-exposure prophylaxis scale-up should be accompanied by measures to monitor the quality of antiretroviral drug delivery and surveillance of HIVDR.Quality data should be obtained from periodic nationally representative HIVDR surveys among different populations.Laboratory-based survey of acquired HIV drug resistance using remnant viral load specimensClinical-based survey of acquired HIV drug resistanceSentinel surveys of acquired HIV resistance to dolutegravir among people receiving dolutegravir-containing antiretroviral therapySurveillance of pretreatment HIV drug resistance- populations initiating first-line ARTPretreatment HIV drug resistance is detected among people initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) with or without prior antiretroviral drug exposure. It can result from transmitted or acquired HIV drug resistance, or both. Surveillance of the pre-treatment HIV drug resistance survey in populations initiating first-line ART is relevant to inform the choice of nationally recommended first-line ART regimens, and also regimens used for pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis.Surveillance of HIV drug resistance in adults initiating antiretroviral therapy- pre – treatment HIV drug resistanceSurveillance of pretreatment HIV drug resistance- treatment -naïve infants newly diagnosed with HIVThe surveillance of pretreatment HIV drug resistance among treatment-naive infants newly diagnosed with HIV is particularly relevant in settings where many infants acquire HIV infection. Surveillance provides critical information to support optimal choice of first- and second-line antiretroviral therapy regimens.The purpose of this surveillance is to assess the prevalence of HIV drug resistance among treatment-naive infants younger than 18 months (regardless of prevention of mother-to-child transmission exposure), who have been newly diagnosed with HIV using early infant diagnosis over a 12-month period.Surveillance of HIV drug resistance in children newly diagnosed with HIV by early infant diagnosis Surveillance of HIV drug resistance- PrEP users diagnosed with HIVWHO recommends pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) as an additional prevention option for HIV-negative individuals at substantial risk of HIV infection, as part of combination prevention approaches. HIV drug resistance was rarely reported among PrEP users diagnosed with HIV in randomized controlled trials or open-label studies.However, PrEP-selected HIV drug resistance could potentially negatively impact the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy (ART) options among PrEP users who acquire HIV. This is because there is a potential for overlapping resistance profiles between antiretroviral drugs used for both PrEP and first-line ART.Therefore, WHO recommends that PrEP scale-up be accompanied by surveillance of HIV drug resistance, as resistance may compromise the effectiveness of first-line ART among PrEP users who acquire HIV.HIV drug resistance surveillance in countries scaling up pre-exposure prophylaxis \n",

Though people living with HIV tend to be most infectious in the first few months, many are unaware of their status until later stages. In the first few weeks after initial infection, individuals may experience no symptoms or an influenza-like illness including fever, headache, rash, or sore throat.As the infection progressively weakens the immune system, an individual can develop other signs and symptoms, such as swollen lymph nodes, weight loss, fever, diarrhoea and cough. Without treatment, they could also develop severe illnesses such as tuberculosis, cryptococcal meningitis, severe bacterial infections and cancers such as lymphomas and Kaposi's sarcoma, among others.Tuberculosis (TB) remains the leading cause of death among people living with HIV, accounting for around one in three AIDS-related deaths.\n",

This early period of infection represents the time of greatest infectivity; however, HIV transmission can occur during all stages of the infection.It is best practice to also retest all people initially diagnosed as HIV-positive before they enrol in care and/or treatment to rule out any potential testing or reporting error. Notably, once a person diagnosed with HIV has started treatment, they should not be retested.Testing and diagnosis of HIV-exposed infants has been a challenge because babies carry their biological mothers’ antibodies and it can take months for these to disappear. For infants and children less than 18 months of age, serological testing is not sufficient to identify HIV infection: virologic testing must be provided (at 6 weeks of age, or at birth) to detect the presence of the virus in infants born to mothers living with HIV.\n",

It is fatal if undetected or untreated and is the leading cause of death among people with HIV, responsible for more than one out of three HIV-associated deaths.Early detection of TB and prompt linkage to TB treatment and ART can prevent these deaths. TB screening should be offered routinely at HIV care services and routine HIV testing should be offered to all patients with presumptive and diagnosed TB.

The recommendation was based on strong evidence from randomized controlled trials showing an approximately 60% lower risk.Since 2007, more than 27 million VMMC procedures have been performed in the 15 priority countries in Eastern and Southern Africa, where about half of all new HIV infections occurred. In the past 10 years, other evidence-based HIV prevention options have also been scaled up, including oral pre-exposure prophylaxis and HIV antiretroviral therapy (with its secondary HIV prevention effect), along with already known interventions, such as condom use and post-exposure prophylaxis.In the ongoing effort to end the AIDS epidemic, a re-examination of the evidence shows that VMMC remains an important intervention, alongside other effective behavioural and biomedical HIV prevention interventions. VMMC should be supported as a key HIV prevention option, within combination prevention for adolescents 15 years and older and adult men in settings with generalized HIV epidemics.Preventing HIV through safe voluntary medical male circumcision for adolescent boys and men in generalized HIV epidemics: recommendations and key considerations.Assessing and enhancing sustainable voluntary medical male circumcision services for HIV prevention in East and Southern Africa: a landscape report of voluntary medical male circumcision priority countries \n",

Oral PrEP is highly effective at preventing HIV when used as directed. In 2021, WHO recommended that the dapivirine ring may be offered as an additional prevention choice for women at substantial risk of HIV and, in 2022, that long-acting injectable cabotegravir (CAB-LA) may be offered as an additional prevention choice for people at substantial risk of HIV.

      "In the African region, a number of women and girls living with HIV become pregnant each year. In the absence of intervention, the rate of transmission of HIV from a mother living with HIV to her child during pregnancy, labour, delivery or breastfeeding ranges from 15% to 45%. As such, identification of HIV infection should be immediately followed by an offer of linkage to lifelong treatment and care, including support to remain in care and virally suppressed and an offer of partner services. Elimination of MTCT of HIV is strongly supported by global commitments and the promotion of integration of prevention of MTCT interventions into maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health services, as well as strengthened health systems. In addition, improved access to sexual and reproductive health services – including preventing unintended pregnancies and screening and treatment for sexually transmitted infections in women and girls living with HIV – is being actively promoted.The integration of interventions has led to the triple elimination initiative, which not only promotes person-centered care, but also reduces incidence, morbidity and mortality. The initiative also strengthens disease monitoring using strategic information for response planning. Essential triple EMTCT services include:Testing for HIV, syphilis and HBV in antenatal care clinics.Prompt and efficacious interventions to treat women who test positive, and to prevent transmission of the infection(s) to their children.Counselling for women and their partners to reduce transmission risk and ensure appropriate treatment.Appropriately attended, safe delivery.Appropriate follow-up of exposed infants, including HBV vaccine birth dose.Optimal infant feeding; andLifelong treatment and care for mothers living with HIV, or eligible for treatment for HBV or syphilis.WHO continues to work in this area, supporting countries to improve and better monitor interventions towards ending the AIDS epidemic as a public health threat by 2030.Validation of elimination of mother-to -child transmission of HIV, syphilis and hepatitis BThe global and regional community has committed itself to the elimination of mother-to-child transmission (EMTCT) of HIV, syphilis, and hepatitis B virus (HBV) as a public health priority. The Triple EMTCT initiative focuses on a harmonized approach to improving health outcomes for mothers and children.The term validation is used to attest that a country has successfully met the criteria for EMTCT of HIV, syphilis, and HBV. WHO develops and regularly updates guidance on the criteria and processes for validation of EMTCT of HIV, syphilis and HBV. Since 2015, Member States have been able to apply for validation for achieving the reduction of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) to a level where it is no longer a public health threat or problem. In 2017, the Path to Elimination was introduced to recognize countries with high prevalence of maternal HIV, syphilis or HBV in their efforts to reduce MTCT.Achieving validation of EMTCT is a tremendous national accomplishment, requiring country-led accountability, rigorous data analysis, intensive programme assessment and multilevel collaboration. Maintaining validation is equally important and requires sustained, broad programme efforts to prevent new infections in infants, children and adults. Through the validation process, WHO and partners continue to provide country support for strengthening health system capacity and comprehensive person-centered, integrated services that respect and protect the human rights of women living with any of the conditions, and to ensure that these women are meaningfully involved in health programme planning and service delivery.Global guidance on criteria and processes for validation: elimination of mother -to-child transmission of HIV, syphilis and hepatitis B.Governance for the validation of elimination of mother to child transmission of HIV, syphilis and hepatitis B virus: an overview of validation structures and responsibilities at national, regional and global levels\n",

      "Alcohol is a psychoactive substance with dependence-producing properties that has been widely used in many cultures for centuries. The harmful use of alcohol causes a large disease, social and economic burden in societies. Environmental factors such as economic development, culture, availability of alcohol and the level and effectiveness of alcohol policies are relevant factors in explaining differences and historical trends in alcohol consumption and related harm.Alcohol-related harm is determined by the volume of alcohol consumed, the pattern of drinking, and, on rare occasions, the quality of alcohol consumed. The harmful use of alcohol is a component cause of more than 200 disease and injury conditions in individuals, most notably alcohol dependence, liver cirrhosis, cancers and injuries. The latest causal relationships established are those between alcohol consumption and incidence of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS.A wide range of effective global, regional and national policies and interventions are in place to reduce the harmful use of alcohol, with a promising trend over the past few decades.Alcohol consumption:Worldwide consumption in 2010 was equal to 6.2 litres of pure alcohol consumed per person aged 15 years or older, which translates into 13.5 grams of pure alcohol per day.A quarter of this consumption (24.8%) was unrecorded, i.e., homemade alcohol, illegally produced or sold outside normal government controls. Of total recorded alcohol consumed worldwide, 50.1% was consumed in the form of spirits.Worldwide 61.7% of the population aged 15 years or older (15+) had not drunk alcohol in the past 12 months. In all WHO regions, females are more often lifetime abstainers than males. There is a considerable variation in prevalence of abstention across WHO regions.Worldwide about 16.0% of drinkers aged 15 years or older engage in heavy episodic drinking.In general, the greater the economic wealth of a country, the more alcohol is consumed and the smaller the number of abstainers. High-income countries have the highest alcohol per capita consumption (APC) and the highest prevalence of heavy episodic drinking among drinkers.Health consequencesIn 2012, about 3.3 million net deaths, or 5.9% of all global deaths, were attributable to alcohol consumption.There are significant sex differences in the proportion of global deaths attributable to alcohol, for example, in 2012 7.6% of deaths among males and 4% of deaths among females were attributable to alcohol.In 2012 139 million net DALYs (disability-adjusted life years), or 5.1% of the global burden of disease and injury, were attributable to alcohol consumption.There is also wide geographical variation in the proportion of alcohol-attributable deaths and DALYs, with the highest alcohol-attributable fractions reported in the WHO European Region.Policies and interventionsAlcohol policies are developed with the aim of reducing harmful use of alcohol and the alcohol-attributable health and social burden in a population and in society. Such policies can be formulated at the global, regional, multinational, national and subnational level.Delegations from all 193 Member States of WHO reached consensus at the World Health Assembly in 2010 on a WHO Global stratgy to reduce the harmful use of alcohol.Many WHO Member States have demonstrated increased leadership and commitment to reducing harmful use of alcohol over the past years.A significantly higher percentage of the reporting countries indicated having written national alcohol policies and imposing stricter blood alcohol concentration limits in 2012 than in 2008.\n",

Globally, cannabis is the most commonly used (129-190 million people), followed by amphetamine type stimulants, then cocaine and opioids.The use of psychoactive substances causes significant health and social problems for the people who use them, and also for others in their families and communities. WHO estimated that 0.7% of the global burden of disease in 2004 was due to cocaine and opioid use, with the social cost of illicit substance use being in the region of 2% of GDP in those countries which have measured it.\n",

      "Some people are more vulnerable to malaria than others.  Partial immunity to malaria can be developed over years of exposure.  As young children have not had the opportunity to build up this partial immunity, they are particularly at risk, and make up the majority of fatal cases of malaria in the WHO African Region.As well as having a significant human cost, the effects of malaria extend far beyond direct measures of morbidity and mortality.  Malaria can reduce school attendance, productivity at work, and there is evidence that the disease can also impair intellectual development. The economic costs are also significant.  Between 1965 and 1990, countries in which a large proportion of the population lived in regions with malaria experienced an average growth in per-capita GDP of 0.4% per year, whereas average growth in other countries was 2.3% per year.\n",

      "\n",
      "RationaleThe WHO Global technical strategy for malaria 2016–2030, provides a technical framework for all malaria-endemic countries. It is intended to guide and support regional and country programmes as they work towards malaria control and elimination. The strategy sets ambitious but achievable global targets, including:reducing malaria mortality rates by at least 90% by 2030reducing malaria case incidence by at least 90% by 2030eliminating malaria in at least 35 countries by 2030preventing a resurgence of malaria in all countries that are malaria-free.How far is the WHO African Region to achieve the above targets?   Key messagesAnalysis of the trends shows that, in 2022, the WHO African Region was off track for both the malaria morbidity and mortality GTS milestones.In 2022, an estimated 580 479 people lost their lives due to malaria in the WHO African Region, which represented 95.4% of total deaths globally, including 78.1% of deaths in children under five compared with 90.7% in 2000.In 2022, an estimated 233 million cases of malaria in the WHO African Region, which represented 93.6% of total cases globallyBetween 2019 and 2022, there were substantial increases in estimated case numbers in Nigeria (5.3 million), Ethiopia (2.4 million), Madagascar (1.5 million), Uganda (1.3 million), the United Republic of Tanzania (1.3 million), Mali (1.1 million) and Mozambique (1 million). Over the same period, Rwanda saw a decrease of more than 3.8 million cases.Cabo Verde was certified malaria-free.Reduction of malaria mortality rates The WHO African Region, with an estimated 233 million cases in 2022, accounted for about 94% of cases globally.Twenty-nine countries accounted for 95% of malaria cases globally. Four countries – Nigeria (27%), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (12%), Uganda (5%) and Mozambique (4%) – accounted for almost half of all cases globally.Burden of malaria in pregnancyIn 2022, in 33 moderate and high transmission countries in the WHO African Region, there were an estimated 35.4 million pregnancies, of which 12.7 million (36%) were exposed to malaria infection during pregnancy.By WHO subregion, prevalence of exposure to malaria during pregnancy in 2022 was highest in west Africa (39.3%) and central Africa (40.1%), and lower in the east and southern Africa subregion (27.0%).Malaria cases and deaths avertedGlobally, an estimated 2.1 billion malaria cases and 11.7 million malaria deaths were averted in the period 2000–2022.Most of the cases and deaths averted were in the WHO African Region (cases 82%, deaths 94%), followed by the WHO South-East Asia Region (cases 10%, deaths 3%).Burden of malaria in pregnancy In 2022, in 33 moderate and high transmission countries in the WHO African Region, there were an estimated 35.4 million pregnancies, of which 12.7 million (36%) were exposed to malaria infection during pregnancy.By WHO subregion, prevalence of exposure to malaria during pregnancy in 2022 was highest in west Africa (39.3%) and central Africa (40.1%), and lower in the east and southern Africa subregion (27.0%).It is estimated that, without a pregnancy-specific intervention, malaria infection during pregnancy in these 33 countries would have resulted in 914 000 neonates with low birthweight, compared with about 393 000 neonates with low birthweight estimated at the current intermittent preventive treatment during pregnancy (IPTp) coverage levels in the three subregions.Malaria EliminationOver time, the elimination of malaria has gained momentum in numerous countries as they approach the milestone of zero indigenous malaria cases and as more countries are certified malaria free.Despite the setbacks, several countries and one territory saw notable reductions in indigenous transmission: Botswana (43.5%), the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (9.3%), Ecuador (38.0%), Eswatini (57.6%), French Guiana (71.6%), Mexico (32.6%) and South Africa (31.3%).Investments in malaria programmes and researchThe GTS sets out estimates of the funding required to achieve milestones for 2025 and 2030. Total annual resources needed were estimated at US$ 6.8 billion in 2020, rising to US$ 9.3 billion in 2025 and US$ 10.3 billion by 2030. An additional US$ 0.85 billion is estimated to be required annually for global malaria research and development (R&D) during the period 2021–2030.Governments of malaria endemic countries contributed more than a third of total funding in 2022, with investments of over US$ 1.5 billion, of which nearly US$ 0.4 billion was spent on malaria case management in the public sector and over US$ 1.1 billion on other malaria control activities. This was a substantial increase of over US$ 0.4 billion since 2021, largely stemming from an influx of domestic spending in the WHO African Region.Distribution and coverage of malaria preventionBy 2022, 70% of households in sub-Saharan Africa had at least one ITN, increasing from about 5% in 2000. The percentage of households owning at least one ITN for every two people increased from 1% in 2000 to 40% in 2022. In the same period, the percentage of the population with access to an ITN within their household increased from 3% to 56%.Distribution and coverage of malaria diagnosis and treatmentGlobally, 3.9 billion rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for malaria were sold by manufacturers in 2010–2022, with 82% of these sales being in sub-Saharan African countries. In the same period, NMPs distributed 2.9 billion RDTs – 90% in sub-Saharan Africa.Between 2000 and 2019, case incidence in the WHO African Region decreased from 370 to 226 per 1000 population at risk, but increased to 232 per 1000 population at risk in 2020, mainly because of disruptions to services during the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2022, case incidence declined to 223 per 1000 population at risk.Cabo Verde reported zero indigenous cases for 4 consecutive years, ending its malaria epidemic.Malaria deathsAbout 96% of malaria deaths globally were in 29 countries. Four countries accounted for just over half of all malaria deaths globally in 2022 – Nigeria (31%), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (12%), Niger (6%) and the United Republic of Tanzania (4%).Malaria deaths in the WHO African Region decreased from 808 000 in 2000 to 548 000 in 2017, before increasing to 604 000 in 2020. Estimated deaths decreased again to 580 000 in 2022. The malaria mortality rate decreased by 60% between 2000 and 2019, from 143 to 57 deaths per 100 000 population at risk, before rising to 61 in 2020 and decreasing again to 56 in 2022.Cabo Verde has reported zero malaria deaths since 2018.  Malaria cases and deaths avertedGlobally, an estimated 2.1 billion malaria cases and 11.7 million malaria deaths were averted in the period 2000–2022.Most of the cases and deaths averted were in the WHO African Region (cases 82%, deaths 94%), followed by the WHO South-East Asia Region (cases 10%, deaths 3%).Malaria Estimated Cases In the African Region, WHO 2023Estimated prevalence of exposure to malaria infection during pregnancy, overall and by subregion in 2022, in moderate to high transmission countries in the WHO African Region Sources: Imperial College and WHO estimate Estimated number of children with low birthweight (WMR 2023)    InterventionPregnant women attending antenatal care  at least once and receiving at least 3 doses of Intermittent Preventive Treatment of Malaria for Pregnant Women (IPTp3) (%)     in the African Region, WHO 2021Number of ITN delivered by manufacturers and distributed by NMPs, 2010-2023Indicators of population level access to ITNs, sub-Saharian Africa, 2000-2022 and b) indicators of population-level use of ITNs, sub-Saharan Africa, 2000-2022, Source; ITN coverage model by the Malaria Atlas Project. Indicators of population level access to ITNs, sub-Saharian Africa, 2000-2022 and b) indicators of population-level use of ITNs, sub-Saharan Africa, 2000-2022, Source; ITN coverage model by the Malaria Atlas Project. Percentage of pregnant women attending an ANC clinic at least once and receiving IPTp, by number of SP doses, sub-Saharan Africa, 2010–2022 Sources: NMP reports, CDC and WHO estimates  \n",

Improved water supply and sanitation, and better management of water resources, can boost countries’ economic growth and can contribute greatly to poverty reduction.\n",

      "The Millennium Development Goal (MDG 7) on drinking-water was met globally in 2010. The target was to halve the proportion of the world’s population without sustainable access to safe water. The 48 least developed countries did not meet the target, but substantial progress has been made with 42 per cent of the current population in these countries gaining access to improved drinking-water sources since 1990.\n",
      "Sharp geographic, sociocultural and economic inequalities persist, not only between rural and urban areas but also in towns and cities where people living in low-income, informal or illegal settlements usually have less access to improved sources of drinking-water than other residents.\n",

      "\n",
      "Contaminated water and poor sanitation are linked to transmission of diseases such as cholera, diarrhoea, dysentery, hepatitis A, typhoid and polio. Absent, inadequate, or inappropriately managed water and sanitation services expose individuals to preventable health risks. This is particularly the case in health care facilities where both patients and staff are placed at additional risk of infection and disease when water, sanitation and hygiene services are lacking. Globally, 15% of patients develop an infection during a hospital stay, with the proportion much greater in low-income countries.\n",
      "Inadequate management of urban, industrial and agricultural wastewater means the drinking-water of hundreds of millions of people is dangerously contaminated or chemically polluted.\n",
      "Some 842 000 people are estimated to die each year from diarrhoea as a result of unsafe drinking-water, sanitation and hand hygiene. But diarrhoea is largely preventable, and the deaths of 361 000 children aged under 5 each year could be avoided each year if these risk factors were addressed. Where water is not readily available, people may decide handwashing is not a priority, thereby adding to the likelihood of diarrhoea and other diseases.\n",
      "Diarrhoea is the most widely known disease linked to contaminated food and water but there are other hazards. Almost 240 million people are affected by schistosomiasis – an acute and chronic disease caused by parasitic worms contracted through exposure to infested water.\n",
      "In many parts of the world, insects that live or breed in water carry and transmit diseases such as dengue fever. Some of these insects, known as vectors, breed in clean, rather than dirty water, and household drinking-water containers can serve as breeding grounds. The simple intervention of covering water storage containers can reduce vector breeding and may also have a co-benefit of reducing faecal contamination of water at the household level.\n",

      "When water comes from improved and more accessible sources, people spend less time and effort in physically collecting it, meaning they can be productive in other ways. It can also result in greater personal safety by reducing the need to make long or risky journeys to collect water. Better water sources also mean less expenditure on health, as people are less likely to fall ill and incur medical costs, and are better able to remain economically productive.\n",
      "With children particularly at risk from water-related diseases, access to improved sources of water can result in better health and therefore better school attendance, with longer-term consequences for their lives.\n",

At least 1.8 billion people use a drinking-water source that is contaminated with faecal matter. A substantial proportion of water supplied through pipes is contaminated, especially where water supply is intermittent or treatment is inadequate. Even where the source is good, water can be contaminated while being transported or stored, especially in environments where sanitation is inadequate.\n",

By 2025, half of the world’s population will be living in water-stressed areas. Re-use of wastewater, to recover water, nutrients, or energy, is becoming an important strategy. Increasingly countries are using wastewater for irrigation – in developing countries this represents 7% of irrigated land. While this practice if done inappropriately poses health risks, safe management of wastewater can yield multiple benefits, including increased food production.\n",
      "Options for water sources used for drinking-water and irrigation will continue to evolve, with an increasing reliance on groundwater and alternative sources, including wastewater. Climate change will lead to greater fluctuations in harvested rainwater. Management of all water resources will need to be improved to ensure provision and quality.\n",

      "As the international authority on public health and water quality, WHO leads global efforts to prevent transmission of waterborne disease, advising governments on the development of health-based targets and regulations.\n",
      "WHO produces a series of water quality guidelines, including on drinking-water, safe use of wastewater, and safe recreational water environments. The water quality guidelines are based on managing risks, and since 2004 the Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality included the promotion of Water Safety Plans to identify and prevent risks before water is contaminated. In 2015, WHO introduced the concept of Sanitation Safety Plans to support implementation of the wastewater guidelines. WHO works on promoting effective risk assessment and management practices among all groups, including suppliers of drinking water, wastewater treatment companies, farmers, communities and individuals.\n",
      "Since 2014, WHO has been testing household water treatment products against WHO health-based performance criteria through the WHO International ‘Scheme’ to Evaluate Household Water Treatment Technologies. The aim of the Scheme is to ensure that products distributed protect users from the pathogens that cause diarrhoeal disease and to strengthen policy, regulatory, and monitoring mechanisms at the national level to support appropriate targeting and consistent and correct use of such products.\n",
      "WHO works closely with UNICEF in a number of areas concerning water and health. For example, the integrated global action plan to end preventable child deaths from pneumonia and diarrhoea by 2025 (GAPPD) sets out several prevention and treatment targets, including achieving universal access to drinking water in health care facilities and homes by 2030. The means of implementation for the work in health care facilities cuts across several health areas, including quality universal health coverage, and the two agencies have established a work plan to incrementally work towards universal access at the facility, national and global level.\n",

      "Abuja, 27 February, 2025 - The World Health Organization (WHO) has reaffirmed its commitment to supporting Nigeria's government in strengthening Primary Health Care (PHC) and addressing health system issues by implementing innovative initiatives. This commitment aligns with the country's goal to eliminate all types of polioviruses by the end of 2025.WHO Country Representative in Nigeria, Dr Walter Kazadi Mulombo, said at the recently concluded First Quarter Review Meeting of the Northern Traditional Leaders Committee (NTLC) on PHC Delivery in Abuja.Earlier in his opening remark, the Coordinating Minister of Health and Social Welfare, Professor Muhammad Pate, had appreciated the council's tenacity in mobilizing their communities and overseeing polio vaccination campaigns towards eradication of the disease in the country. An urgent clarion callProfessor Pate urged the traditional leaders not to rest on their oars. He emphasized the urgent need to eliminate the circulating variant poliovirus type 2 (cVPV2) transmission in the country by December 2025.Professor Pate called on the traditional leaders to double their efforts by leveraging their influence to strengthen community trust and participation in immunization efforts.\"This council has remained the most steadfast primary healthcare structure in Nigeria, Africa, and possibly the world. For 16 consecutive years, you have convened quarterly meetings without fail. Delivering his goodwill message, Dr Mulombo also set the tone with a call to action, lauding the Nigerian government's and traditional leaders' unwavering commitment and underscoring their critical role in championing the fight against polio in Nigeria. \"While 2024 has been a challenging year for Nigeria's polio program, we have the opportunity to turn things around, and now is the best time to act urgently and decisively to end cVPV2 in the country. WHO is committed to supporting Nigeria in addressing the challenges, even in the face of geopolitical complexities\", said Dr Mulombo.The Country Representative also pledged WHO's support in fast-tracking the accreditation of the Ibadan polio laboratory while announcing that the laboratory is fully accredited to conduct polio sequencing.The polio laboratory in Ibadan, established in 1993, is one of the iconic polio laboratories in Nigeria that can detect, identify, and promptly report wild polioviruses (WPV), cVPVD2, as well as other enteroviruses that may be present in clinical and environmental specimens.Tackling Challenges with Renewed CommitmentDespite the progress made, Nigeria is still reporting cases of cVPVD2. Dr Muyi Aina, Executive Director of the National Primary Healthcare Development Agency (NPHCDA),  pointed out some of the challenges deterring the nation from achieving its polio eradication goal said, \"For too long, we have struggled with issues like noncompliance, vaccine hesitancy, missed children, security concerns, inadequate routine immunization coverage, data falsification and malnutrition. We need to push beyond our limitations and ensure that no child is left unvaccinated. We need the support of the NTLC members, as community engagement is key to achieving success. We must rewrite the story this year,\" said Dr Muyi.Traditional Leaders Vow to Strengthen EffortsIn his remark, Alhaji Sama'ila Muhammad Mera, the Emir of Argungu, who double as the NTLC chair, expressed gratitude to the government and partners for their continued support. The Emir called on his fellow traditional leaders to collaborate with religious figures and community influencers to drive vaccination demand.Raising concerns over the suboptimal performance of routine immunization in the country's North Central and North West geopolitical regions in 2024, he said, \"The time has come for us to end polio once and for all. Every unvaccinated child is a risk to all children in our communities. We must strengthen newborn and defaulter tracking systems to ensure every child receives the necessary vaccines. We must play an active role in planning and supervising immunization sessions,\" the Emir urged.The Emir welcomed the strategic shifts introduced by the government, including increased accountability, localized advocacy, improved data integration, and synchronized campaign efforts. A Unified Effort to End PolioThe NTLC's quarterly meetings serve as a vital platform for reviewing progress and tackling challenges in polio eradication, routine immunization, maternal and child health, and primary healthcare service delivery.The latest gathering featured presentations on the state of Nigeria's polio program, updates on routine immunization, maternal and newborn health, and the introduction of the rubella vaccine. Participants also discussed previous meeting resolutions, with various partners delivering goodwill messages.\n",

      "Kampala/Uganda: The Uganda Ministry of Health (MOH), with support from the World Health Organization (WHO) and partners deployed the national Emergency Medical Team (nEMT) to the ongoing Sudan Virus Disease (SVD) response. On 30 January 2025, MOH declared an outbreak of SVD in the country after a 35-year-old Ugandan male who worked as a nurse in Mulago National Referral Hospital tested positive for the virus following his death on 29 January 2025. Before his diagnosis, he sought treatment at multiple health facilities, including Mulago Referral Hospital in Kampala, Saidina Abubakar Islamic Hospital in Matugga in Wakiso District, and Mbale Regional Referral Hospital in Mbale City.By 2 February 2025, Uganda had recorded a total of nine confirmed cases. This includes the index case and eight additional confirmed cases from three different districts. This brings the total to nine cases (one mortality and eight recoveries).  In response, the Ministry of Health swiftly deployed the national Emergency Medical Team to support case management. A total of 44 national Emergency Medical Team members of various cadres were deployed. A team of 26 was deployed to support the operationalization of Mulago National Referral Hospital, while 18 were deployed to Mbale district Ebola treatment unit. This marked the first time that the country has deployed the national EMT for an Ebola response. At Mulago hospital, the nEMT members were on ground within two hours of deployment, immediately  setting up the isolation unit and preparing to receive patients. Their support included providing direct clinical care according to national Ebola case management guidelines, strengthening referral systems to evacuate new cases from the community promptly, and building capacity of the local teams through training and mentorship. In Mbale, the team was deployed on Monday 3 February 2025 to strengthen the isolation unit set-up and support clinical care. The Mbale team consisted of 18 members including physicians, nurses, a logistician, Infection Prevention and Control officer, plus a safe and dignified burial team. “In previous outbreaks, we relied on mobilization of health workers across the country, working alongside surge teams from outside the country. However, this time, we had a fully trained, readily deployable trained team who were on-site within two hours of deployment and fully constituted within 12 hours. As a country, this is a proud moment for us,” said Dr Rony Bahatungire, Ag. Commissioner - Clinical Services and national EMT focal person. Beyond clinical care, the nEMT has played a critical role in providing mental health and psycho-social services to health workers, patients and their communities including affected schools. Mentorship and training were extended to existing health workers within the local systems, to ensure sustainable support to survivors’ resettlement.  Sudan Virus Disease outbreaks have reported a mortality rate between 41% to 70% in previous outbreaks. The last outbreak in the country recorded a mortality rate of 47%. However, the EVD mortality rate during this response has been 11.1%, and this was the index case. The response has recorded a 100% survival rate for all patients admitted to the isolation units. This is due to multiple reasons including the rapid deployment of an experienced EMT that has maintained the high standard of care.Since their deployment on 30 January 2025, the team has maintained 24-hour coverage, providing optimized clinical care. This included early supportive care across the spectrum from mild cases to provision of critical care. They have managed a total of eight confirmed cases and numerous suspects. To date, no mortality has been reported in either of the isolation units, despite managing some severe and critical cases including children. “Public health emergencies can quickly overwhelm the local health systems, necessitating additional support. Fortunately, the national EMTs understand the local context and are readily deployable to support affected communities,” said Dr Kasonde Mwinga, the WHO Representative to Uganda.Uganda currently has 149 nEMT members, ready to respond to public health emergencies.  The nEMT concept dates to December 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic. At the time, MOH, with support from WHO, hosted the first regional training for nEMT members to support the COVID-19 response. MOH continued to build the team through additional trainings and drills supported by WHO with funding from partners like the European Union Humanitarian Aid Agency (DG ECHO), the Robert Koch Institute and Malteser International among others. The nEMT has also previously deployed for Mpox and measles outbreaks within the country. In July 2024, Uganda’s Ministry of Health approved the nEMT roadmap to guide future emergency response efforts. This aligns with the WHO global EMT initiative, which aims to improve the speed and quality of emergency medical response while strengthening national health systems.“The work that we do is not only about responding to outbreaks. Preparedness is an important part of our work. The Uganda national EMTs program has shown the importance of preparedness and its impact on response.” Dr Michael Ryan, Deputy Director General and Head - World Health Emergencies, WHO Headquarters, Geneva.   \n",

      "Kinshasa – Health authorities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and experts from World Health Organization (WHO) are carrying out further investigations to determine the cause of another cluster of illness and community deaths in Equateur province. In recent months, disease surveillance has identified increases in illness and deaths three times in different areas of the country, and triggered follow-up investigations to confirm the cause and provide needed support.  Since the beginning of 2025, a series of illnesses and community deaths have affected Equateur province. The most recent cluster occurred in the Basankusu health zone, where last week 141 additional people fell ill, with no deaths reported. In the same health zone, 158 cases and 58 deaths were reported in the same health zone earlier in February. In January, Bolamba health zone reported 12 people who fell ill including 8 deaths. Increased disease surveillance has identified in total of 1096 sick people and 60 deaths in Basankusu and Bolomba fitting a broad case definition that includes fever, headache, chills, sweating, stiff neck, muscle aches, multiple joint pain and body aches, a runny or bleeding from nose, cough, vomiting and diarrhoea.  The Democratic Republic of the Congo is facing many concurrent crises and outbreaks, putting a further strain on the health sector and the population. In response to the latest cluster of illness, a national rapid response team from Kinshasa and Equateur including WHO health emergency experts was deployed to Basankusu and Bolomba health zones to investigate the situation and determine if there is an unusual pattern. The experts are stepping up disease surveillance, conducting interviews with community members to understand the background, and providing treatment for diseases such as malaria, typhoid fever and meningitis.  WHO has delivered emergency medical supplies, including testing kits, and developed detailed protocols to enhance disease investigation. Initial laboratory analysis has turned out negative for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus disease. Around half of the samples tested positive for malaria, which is common in the region. Further tests are to be carried out for meningitis. Food, water and environmental samples will also be analysed, to determine if there might be contamination. The various samples will be sent for further testing at the national reference laboratory in Kinshasa. Earlier samples turned out not to be viable and re-testing was undertaken.  Basankusu and Bolomba are about 180 kilometres apart and more than 300 kilometres from the provincial capital Mbandaka. The two localities are reachable by road or via the Congo River from Mbandaka. This remoteness limits access to health care, including testing and treatment. Poor road and telecommunication infrastructure are also major challenges. WHO is supporting the local health authorities reinforce investigation and response measures, with more than 80 community health workers trained to detect and report cases and deaths.   Further efforts are needed to reinforce testing, early case detection and reporting, for the current event but also for future incidents. WHO remains on the ground supporting health worker, collaborating closely with zonal, provincial and national health authorities to provide lifesaving medical supplies and to coordinate response to curb the spread of the illness and other outbreaks in the region. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "26 February 2025\n",
      "\n",
      "In the war-torn streets of Kabul, bombed-out buildings stood as stark reminders of a life disrupted. Families, including one young boy's, struggled to rebuild amidst the chaos. For this boy, survival was not the only battle; his greatest fight was for an education.School was a fragile promise. On some days, there were no classrooms—just open spaces where children sat on the dirt, balancing books on their knees. Other days, the threat of violence kept them at home. When they did manage to attend school, they faced a shortage of teachers and materials. Yet, they held onto hope. Hope that education could be their escape. Hope that someone, somewhere, believed in their potential.That belief came from the United Nations and international organizations. These entities stepped in, providing books, rebuilding classrooms, and most importantly, instilling the belief that these children's futures mattered. Thanks to their efforts, the boy completed high school and graduated from Kabul Medical University in Afghanistan.Decades later, this boy, Amran Mohammad Yosuf, found himself on the other side of the story-now working with the World Health Organization (WHO) as a Technical Officer in the Uganda Country Office. His work takes him across borders, from one emergency to another. It was in Kitgum, northern Uganda, that his past and present converged.While in Kitgum last year, Yosuf visited a school where children sat on the ground, just as he once had. There were no desks, no proper classrooms—only the children's unwavering determination to learn. The sight struck a deep chord within him. In their faces, he saw his younger self: a boy with dreams far bigger than his circumstances.This experience highlights a profound truth; experience shapes not only who we are but also how we serve others. His journey had come full circle. He was no longer just a doctor or a health professional; he was someone who had once sat in the same dust, felt the same hunger for opportunity, and known the impact of compassion from strangers.Empathy, he realized, is crucial in global health. Data and strategies are important, but they mean nothing if the human beings behind them are forgotten. He knew firsthand what it was like to be on the receiving end of international aid—not as a statistic, but as a child whose life was transformed because someone cared enough to act.This is why organizations like WHO and the UN must continue their work. They are not just responding to crises; they are shaping futures. Yosuf's life was living proof of that.But this story is not just about Yosuf. It is about every child in Kitgum, in Kabul, and in countless other places where potential waits to be nurtured. Their futures depend on whether the world chooses to invest in them or turn away.The global community cannot afford to turn away. Continued support for WHO, the UN, and other organizations fighting to give children a chance is essential. Every act of support—no matter how small—does not just change lives. It creates doctors, leaders, and changemakers who will one day stand where Yousef stands today.Because sometimes, the children invested in today will be the ones who shape the world tomorrow. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "26 February 2025\n",
      "\n",
      "Juba - The ongoing conflict in Sudan has forced more than 160,000 people to seek refuge in South Sudan since mid-December 2024, placing immense pressure on an already overstretched healthcare system. Renk County, particularly its border town and surrounding villages, has become the primary destination for these displaced individuals, exacerbating existing health challenges.Renk County Hospital remains a vital lifeline for trauma care. As violence intensifies near the Sudan-South Sudan border, the hospital is struggling to cope with a surge in casualties. In response, the World Health Organization (WHO), in partnership with humanitarian organizations, has established a temporary trauma center. This facility, equipped with 60 beds, a triage area, an operating theater, and a post-operative ward, has provided critical support. However, the overwhelming demand for surgical interventions—exceeding 300 cases of injuries from armed violence —continues to strain resources and health care personnel.“The number of patients seeking care in Renk Hospital is increasing daily. We are attending to over 250 outpatients and more than 100 inpatients each day, far exceeding our operational capacity,” said Dr. Ayuel Lual, Medical Director at Renk Hospital. “We are grateful for the timely support from our partners, particularly WHO, whose interventions have been instrumental in keeping the hospital functional.”The response to recent mass casualty incidents has been bolstered by the collaborative efforts of WHO, MSF-Belgium, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), and the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR). Their support has been crucial in delivering urgent medical and surgical care despite the challenging conditions.Beyond trauma care, the worsening humanitarian crisis has heightened the risk of disease outbreaks. The influx of displaced populations has led to deteriorating sanitation and overcrowding, fueling the spread of infectious diseases, including cholera. The already strained healthcare infrastructure now faces an increased demand for prevention, treatment, and disease surveillance.Dr. Humphrey Karamagi, WHO Representative for South Sudan, underscored the gravity of the situation: “The scale of displacement is staggering, and health needs have risen dramatically. WHO and partners are ramping up the response by delivering essential medical supplies and expanding health services to new border crossings experiencing a surge in arrivals.”Expanding emergency health servicesTo meet the escalating demand for emergency and surgical care, WHO has deployed additional makeshift tents, increasing bed capacity by 60. This expansion aims to ensure that more patients receive lifesaving treatment without delay.With funding from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the EU Civil Protection & Humanitarian Aid (ECHO), WHO has distributed 12.5 metric tons of emergency health kits. These kits include Interagency Emergency Health kits, kits for emergency surgery and trauma management, cholera kits, and other vital lifesaving medicines. This distribution has benefited around 123,000 individuals affected by conflict and the host community.Call for sustained humanitarian supportAs the crisis deepens, continued humanitarian assistance is critical. The collaborative efforts of WHO and its partners highlight the urgent need for sustained funding and resources to support the growing healthcare demands in Renk. Strengthened coordination and long-term investment in health services are essential to alleviating suffering and ensuring that both displaced populations and host communities receive the care they desperately need. \n",

      "27 February 2025\n",
      "\n",
      "Luanda – One morning in late January 2025, Julia Armando found her 68-year-old mother collapsed on the floor, suffering from severe diarrhoea and vomiting. “It’s a situation I’ve never seen before… it was a shock to see my mother lying on the floor without strength,” she says. Armando rushed her mother to the nearest cholera treatment centre, where she was treated and thankfully made a full recovery.After her firsthand experience of the severity of cholera as Angola battles an outbreak of the disease, Armando, from the north-western Bengo province and one of the most affected by the outbreak, has become an advocate in her community. She spreads awareness of cholera symptoms and the need to report to a health facility immediately if symptoms are detected. “We need to control this dangerous disease. We can’t live well while it persists,” she says.Julia’s experience has become more common in the three most affected provinces, namely Luanda, Bengo and Icolo e Bengo, since the cholera outbreak was confirmed in Angola on 7 January 2025.Given the increased risk associated with onset of the rainy season, the health authorities in Angola, with support from World Health Organization (WHO) and partners, are intensifying control measures to halt the spread of the disease and end the outbreak. This includes the deployment of 20 rapid response teams in three provinces, namely Luanda, Bengo and Icolo e Bengo, to conduct active case finding in communities and strengthen the community resilience.WHO has trained more than 120 health workers in active case finding and reporting, performing rapid infection surveys, processing data and mobilizing communities to adopt preventive measures. In Bengo province, the health authorities, with WHO’s support, have established 13 rapid response teams working daily in communities.“WHO is supporting the government in reinforcing response teams in the communities, ensuring timely identification of affected individuals, mobilizing the community, controlling infections, and protecting the Angolan population,” says Dr Lelo Zola, WHO Emergency Officer.In addition to active case finding, the Ministry of Health, with support from the WHO, UNICEF, the World Bank, and the International Committee of the Red Cross, conducted a reactive five-day vaccination campaign in January 2025, vaccinating more than 900 000 people. Thanks to strong community engagement and advocacy efforts, the campaign achieved a 99.5% vaccination coverage rate.“We are all committed to ending cholera and are grateful for WHO’s support. With active cholera case finding in the community, combined with community mobilization, use of safe water, good hygiene, adequate surveillance, prompt case management and vaccination, we expect to see a reduction in cases,” says Bengo provincial health director, Domingos Golão.Since the outbreak was confirmed, around 5000 suspected cases including 800 confirmed have been reported, with 180 deaths and a 3.6% case fatality rate (CFR). While WHO’s recommendation is that CFR should not exceed 1%, it has reduced from 9% at its peak in the second week of January 2025. As more cases are identified through active search and appropriately treated, fewer deaths are recorded.“We must all work together ‒ government, national and international organizations, and the private sector ‒ to ensure access to treated water, timely treatment, and preventive measures, especially in the most critical and hard-to-reach areas. It is our joint responsibility to prevent further loss of life from this preventable and treatable disease,” says Dr Zabulon Yoti, WHO Representative in Angola. \n",

      "Abuja, 27 February, 2025 - The World Health Organization (WHO) has reaffirmed its commitment to supporting Nigeria's government in strengthening Primary Health Care (PHC) and addressing health system issues by implementing innovative initiatives. This commitment aligns with the country's goal to eliminate all types of polioviruses by the end of 2025.WHO Country Representative in Nigeria, Dr Walter Kazadi Mulombo, said at the recently concluded First Quarter Review Meeting of the Northern Traditional Leaders Committee (NTLC) on PHC Delivery in Abuja.Earlier in his opening remark, the Coordinating Minister of Health and Social Welfare, Professor Muhammad Pate, had appreciated the council's tenacity in mobilizing their communities and overseeing polio vaccination campaigns towards eradication of the disease in the country. An urgent clarion callProfessor Pate urged the traditional leaders not to rest on their oars. He emphasized the urgent need to eliminate the circulating variant poliovirus type 2 (cVPV2) transmission in the country by December 2025.Professor Pate called on the traditional leaders to double their efforts by leveraging their influence to strengthen community trust and participation in immunization efforts.\"This council has remained the most steadfast primary healthcare structure in Nigeria, Africa, and possibly the world. For 16 consecutive years, you have convened quarterly meetings without fail. Delivering his goodwill message, Dr Mulombo also set the tone with a call to action, lauding the Nigerian government's and traditional leaders' unwavering commitment and underscoring their critical role in championing the fight against polio in Nigeria. \"While 2024 has been a challenging year for Nigeria's polio program, we have the opportunity to turn things around, and now is the best time to act urgently and decisively to end cVPV2 in the country. WHO is committed to supporting Nigeria in addressing the challenges, even in the face of geopolitical complexities\", said Dr Mulombo.The Country Representative also pledged WHO's support in fast-tracking the accreditation of the Ibadan polio laboratory while announcing that the laboratory is fully accredited to conduct polio sequencing.The polio laboratory in Ibadan, established in 1993, is one of the iconic polio laboratories in Nigeria that can detect, identify, and promptly report wild polioviruses (WPV), cVPVD2, as well as other enteroviruses that may be present in clinical and environmental specimens.Tackling Challenges with Renewed CommitmentDespite the progress made, Nigeria is still reporting cases of cVPVD2. Dr Muyi Aina, Executive Director of the National Primary Healthcare Development Agency (NPHCDA),  pointed out some of the challenges deterring the nation from achieving its polio eradication goal said, \"For too long, we have struggled with issues like noncompliance, vaccine hesitancy, missed children, security concerns, inadequate routine immunization coverage, data falsification and malnutrition. We need to push beyond our limitations and ensure that no child is left unvaccinated. We need the support of the NTLC members, as community engagement is key to achieving success. We must rewrite the story this year,\" said Dr Muyi.Traditional Leaders Vow to Strengthen EffortsIn his remark, Alhaji Sama'ila Muhammad Mera, the Emir of Argungu, who double as the NTLC chair, expressed gratitude to the government and partners for their continued support. The Emir called on his fellow traditional leaders to collaborate with religious figures and community influencers to drive vaccination demand.Raising concerns over the suboptimal performance of routine immunization in the country's North Central and North West geopolitical regions in 2024, he said, \"The time has come for us to end polio once and for all. Every unvaccinated child is a risk to all children in our communities. We must strengthen newborn and defaulter tracking systems to ensure every child receives the necessary vaccines. We must play an active role in planning and supervising immunization sessions,\" the Emir urged.The Emir welcomed the strategic shifts introduced by the government, including increased accountability, localized advocacy, improved data integration, and synchronized campaign efforts. A Unified Effort to End PolioThe NTLC's quarterly meetings serve as a vital platform for reviewing progress and tackling challenges in polio eradication, routine immunization, maternal and child health, and primary healthcare service delivery.The latest gathering featured presentations on the state of Nigeria's polio program, updates on routine immunization, maternal and newborn health, and the introduction of the rubella vaccine. Participants also discussed previous meeting resolutions, with various partners delivering goodwill messages.\n",

      "Kampala/Uganda: The Uganda Ministry of Health (MOH), with support from the World Health Organization (WHO) and partners deployed the national Emergency Medical Team (nEMT) to the ongoing Sudan Virus Disease (SVD) response. On 30 January 2025, MOH declared an outbreak of SVD in the country after a 35-year-old Ugandan male who worked as a nurse in Mulago National Referral Hospital tested positive for the virus following his death on 29 January 2025. Before his diagnosis, he sought treatment at multiple health facilities, including Mulago Referral Hospital in Kampala, Saidina Abubakar Islamic Hospital in Matugga in Wakiso District, and Mbale Regional Referral Hospital in Mbale City.By 2 February 2025, Uganda had recorded a total of nine confirmed cases. This includes the index case and eight additional confirmed cases from three different districts. This brings the total to nine cases (one mortality and eight recoveries).  In response, the Ministry of Health swiftly deployed the national Emergency Medical Team to support case management. A total of 44 national Emergency Medical Team members of various cadres were deployed. A team of 26 was deployed to support the operationalization of Mulago National Referral Hospital, while 18 were deployed to Mbale district Ebola treatment unit. This marked the first time that the country has deployed the national EMT for an Ebola response. At Mulago hospital, the nEMT members were on ground within two hours of deployment, immediately  setting up the isolation unit and preparing to receive patients. Their support included providing direct clinical care according to national Ebola case management guidelines, strengthening referral systems to evacuate new cases from the community promptly, and building capacity of the local teams through training and mentorship. In Mbale, the team was deployed on Monday 3 February 2025 to strengthen the isolation unit set-up and support clinical care. The Mbale team consisted of 18 members including physicians, nurses, a logistician, Infection Prevention and Control officer, plus a safe and dignified burial team. “In previous outbreaks, we relied on mobilization of health workers across the country, working alongside surge teams from outside the country. However, this time, we had a fully trained, readily deployable trained team who were on-site within two hours of deployment and fully constituted within 12 hours. As a country, this is a proud moment for us,” said Dr Rony Bahatungire, Ag. Commissioner - Clinical Services and national EMT focal person. Beyond clinical care, the nEMT has played a critical role in providing mental health and psycho-social services to health workers, patients and their communities including affected schools. Mentorship and training were extended to existing health workers within the local systems, to ensure sustainable support to survivors’ resettlement.  Sudan Virus Disease outbreaks have reported a mortality rate between 41% to 70% in previous outbreaks. The last outbreak in the country recorded a mortality rate of 47%. However, the EVD mortality rate during this response has been 11.1%, and this was the index case. The response has recorded a 100% survival rate for all patients admitted to the isolation units. This is due to multiple reasons including the rapid deployment of an experienced EMT that has maintained the high standard of care.Since their deployment on 30 January 2025, the team has maintained 24-hour coverage, providing optimized clinical care. This included early supportive care across the spectrum from mild cases to provision of critical care. They have managed a total of eight confirmed cases and numerous suspects. To date, no mortality has been reported in either of the isolation units, despite managing some severe and critical cases including children. “Public health emergencies can quickly overwhelm the local health systems, necessitating additional support. Fortunately, the national EMTs understand the local context and are readily deployable to support affected communities,” said Dr Kasonde Mwinga, the WHO Representative to Uganda.Uganda currently has 149 nEMT members, ready to respond to public health emergencies.  The nEMT concept dates to December 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic. At the time, MOH, with support from WHO, hosted the first regional training for nEMT members to support the COVID-19 response. MOH continued to build the team through additional trainings and drills supported by WHO with funding from partners like the European Union Humanitarian Aid Agency (DG ECHO), the Robert Koch Institute and Malteser International among others. The nEMT has also previously deployed for Mpox and measles outbreaks within the country. In July 2024, Uganda’s Ministry of Health approved the nEMT roadmap to guide future emergency response efforts. This aligns with the WHO global EMT initiative, which aims to improve the speed and quality of emergency medical response while strengthening national health systems.“The work that we do is not only about responding to outbreaks. Preparedness is an important part of our work. The Uganda national EMTs program has shown the importance of preparedness and its impact on response.” Dr Michael Ryan, Deputy Director General and Head - World Health Emergencies, WHO Headquarters, Geneva.   \n",

      "Lomé – Renforcer la préparation aux urgences de santé publique à travers une meilleure surveillance épidémiologique, des systèmes de laboratoires améliorés et le développement des ressources humaines en santé, c’est le but visé par le projet du Fonds de lutte contre les pandémies qui est mis en œuvre au Togo. Dans cet article, le Dr Amadou Baïlo Diallo, représentant par intérim de l’Organisation mondiale de la Santé (OMS) au Togo, revient sur cette initiative, soutenue par l’OMS,sous la direction du gouvernement et en partenariat avec la FAO et l’UNICEF, l’OIM et la Croix Rouge togolaise.Le Dr Diallo souligne l’exploit du Togo, qui fait partie des cinq pays africains sélectionnés parmi 179 candidatures mondiales pour bénéficier de ce fonds. Il met en avant l’importance de la collaboration multisectorielle, notamment grâce à l’approche « Une seule santé », pour répondre efficacement aux risques épidémiques et aux urgences de santé publique. En perspective, le Dr Diallo énonce les priorités et les enseignements tirés pour renforcer les capacités nationales de réponse aux crises sanitaires au Togo sur les trois prochaines années.  Pouvez-vous nous parler du projet Fonds de lutte contre les pandémies (Pandemic Fund) au Togo ?J'ai une bonne connaissance de l’initiative du Fonds de lutte contre les pandémies pour avoir coordonné au niveau du Bureau régional de l’OMS pour l’Afrique notamment au Hub de Dakar (Sénégal) l’élaboration des demandes de financement pour les pays de l’Afrique de l’Ouest et du Centre à soumettre au Fonds pandémique pour les rounds 1 et 2 respectivement en 2023 et 2024. Le projet de renforcement de la préparation et la réponse aux urgences sanitaires au Togo, financé par le Fonds pandémique est une innovation dans la mobilisation des ressources financières pour soutenir les pays à revenu intermédiaire dont le Togo dans la lutte contre les maladies à potentiel épidémique. Au Togo comme dans les autres pays soutenus par le Fonds pandémique, trois domaines d’intervention sont prioritaires. Il s’agit de la surveillance épidémiologique et l’alerte précoce, des ressources humaines et le système de laboratoire. Le Togo fait partie des cinq (05) pays africains dont la proposition a été retenue sur les 179 demandes soumises au Conseil de direction du Fonds. La mise en œuvre de ce projet au Togo est une concrétisation de l’opérationnalisation de la plateforme nationale « Une seule santé », « One Health » en anglais, plateforme multisectorielle dans laquelle travaillent ensemble les Ministère de la santé, de l’agriculture et de l’élevage, de l’environnement pour renforcer les capacités de préparation et de réponse du pays face aux urgences de santé publique.  Les partenaires de ce projet au Togo sont le gouvernement togolais, représenté par les Ministères respectivement en charge de la santé, de l’agriculture et de l’élevage, et de l’environnement, l’OMS, la FAO et l’UNICEF. Le projet de lutte contre les pandémies au Togo vise trois objectifs. Il s’agit de renforcer le système de détection, d’alerte précoce et de riposte contre les épidémies et pandémies. A cela s’ajoute l’amélioration de la fonctionnalité et de la qualité du réseau national de laboratoires pour le diagnostic des maladies à potentiel épidémique. Et enfin, le pays est appelé à renforcer les capacités en ressources humaines en santé humaine, animale et environnementale pour la préparation aux urgences.La mise en œuvre du projet est entamée depuis le mois d’octobre 2023 à travers l’allocation des ressources aux partenaires, la mise en place d’une équipe de coordination technique du projet qui réunit les experts des trois Ministères clés et les agences d’exécution, l’élaboration d’un plan de suivi et évaluation, l’élaboration et la mise en œuvre des plans d’action trimestriels. Le premier rapport technique annuel a été élaboré et soumis au Fonds pandémique au mois de juin 2024 avec un taux d’exécution financière de 33 %.  Pour les trois prochaines années, quelles améliorations voudriez-vous voir dans la prévention des pandémies, leurs préparations et la capacité de réponse nationale au Togo ?D’une manière générale, je suis persuadé qu’aux termes de ce projet au Togo, avec les efforts combinés en cours aussi bien au niveau des acteurs nationaux que des partenaires, les capacités essentielles du Règlement sanitaire international (RSI 2005) seraient renforcées dans les domaines de la prévention, la détection et la réponse face aux urgences de santé publique. De manière spécifique pour les trois prochaines années, nous espérons que les résultats probants seront obtenus à savoir : le renforcement des capacités de détection des épidémies à travers les activités de surveillance épidémiologique et d’alerte précoce et le renforcement des capacités du personnel de santé humaine, animale et environnementale pour une meilleure préparation et réponse aux urgences de santé publique. Autres résultats : le renforcement du système national de laboratoire pour une confirmation rapide des épidémies ainsi que le développement de l’approche multisectorielle pour la préparation et la réponse, sans oublier la réduction de la morbidité et la mortalité liées aux maladies à potentiel épidémique au Togo.   Quels sont les éléments nécessaires à la réussite d'un projet du Fonds pandémique au Togo ?Les facteurs de succès du projet de Fonds pandémique au Togo sont de trois niveaux. D’abord, c’est la volonté politique manifeste du gouvernement togolais à développer et mettre en œuvre une politique nationale de santé soutenue par l’élaboration et la mise en œuvre d’un Plan national de développement sanitaire (PNDS) lequel intègre la mobilisation des ressources additionnelles auprès des partenaires pour les programmes prioritaires dont la préparation et la réponse aux urgences de santé publique. Ensuite, vient l’adhésion du gouvernement togolais aux initiatives mondiales en faveur de la santé publique mondiale et le développement tels que le Règlement sanitaire international (RSI 2005), l’initiative « Une seule santé » ou « One Health », les objectifs de développement durable (ODD). Et enfin, nous saluons la disponibilité des partenaires techniques et financiers (PTF) à harmoniser leurs efforts pour travailler ensemble tout en s’alignant aux priorités du gouvernement togolais pour une meilleure efficacité de l’aide au développement. Dans le cas de ce projet, un partenariat fort est en train d’être concrétisé entre l’OMS, l’UNICEF et la FAO qui sont les agences d’exécution. L’OIM et la Croix rouge togolaise en sont des contractants avec l’OMS dans l’exécution des volets spécifiques du projet entrant dans leurs domaines de compétence.  Quel rôle joue l’augmentation des investissements dans le renforcement des capacités nationales en prévention des pandémies, leur préparation et la capacité de réponse au Togo ?L’obtention de ce financement du Fonds pandémique est un véritable succès pour le gouvernement togolais et de ses partenaires mais aussi une opportunité de renforcement des capacités nationales de préparation et de réponse aux urgences d’une part, une source additionnelle de ressources pour le renforcement du système national de santé du Togo d’autre part.  Quels sont les enseignements tirés des épidémies passées au Togo qui pourraient être appliqués dans la mise en œuvre du projet du Fonds de lutte contre la pandémie au Togo (en particulier dans les domaines de la surveillance, des laboratoire et du personnel de santé) ?Ils sont nombreux. On peut citer la mise en œuvre de la stratégie régionale de surveillance intégrée de la maladie et la riposte (SIMR), les plans de contingence de lutte contre les maladies à potentiel épidémique telles que la méningite, la fièvre jaune, la fièvre de la Lassa, la rougeole, le choléra et la pandémie de la Covid-19 ainsi que les leçons tirées par la documentation de la gestion de ces urgences à travers les revues- après actions (RAA).Nous pouvons également citer le renforcement régulier des capacités essentielles du (RSI 2005) et l’utilisation des résultats des différentes évaluations des risques y compris l’évaluation externe conjointe du RSI 2005 qui pourraient être bénéfiques aux trois domaines prioritaires du Fonds pandémique que sont la surveillance, le système de laboratoires et le personnel de santé. Votre mot de fin ?Je voudrais lancer un appel aux acteurs et aux partenaires du système de santé togolais de poursuivre leurs efforts communs pour le renforcement des capacités nationales de préparation et de réponse aux urgences de santé publique. Nous devons davantage travailler ensemble sur la préparation aux urgences car par expérience, je peux rassurer qu’une préparation aussi petite qu’elle soit est bénéfique pour une réponse efficace face à une urgence.En somme, le Fonds pandémique est une initiative de financement de la préparation aux épidémies/pandémies mis à la disposition des pays à revenu faible et intermédiaire dont la mise en œuvre contribuerait au renforcement des capacités essentielles du (RSI 2005). Le Togo et les partenaires techniques et financiers en santé ne ménageront aucun effort pour permettre au premier round de ce projet d’atteindre ses résultats tout en espérant que le deuxième sera obtenu aussitôt afin de soutenir les efforts du pays dans la gestion efficace de l’impact de la crise du Sahel central dans le développement socio-sanitaire de la région des Savanes. L’obtention des financements dans le cadre du 2è cycle de financement du Fonds pandémique (Pandemic Fund) permettrait également la prise en compte des déterminants environnementaux des épidémies et la lutte contre les changements climatiques.  A propos du Dr DialloLe Dr Amadou Baïlo Diallo est un médecin épidémiologiste qui a plus de 30 ans d'expérience. Le Dr Diallo possède une connaissance approfondie des pays en développement, en particulier de l'Afrique. Il travaille pour l'Organisation mondiale de la Santé (OMS) depuis 2004 et il occupe actuellement le poste de représentant par intérim de l'OMS au Togo. Avant de rejoindre l’OMS, le Dr Diallo a respectivement travaillé pour le Ministère guinéen de la santé publique, le centre national de lutte contre le paludisme de Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso) et le centre international de coopération en santé et développement (Canada). A ces titres, le Dr Diallo a contribué au développement des systèmes de santé dans les pays en développement, notamment dans la lutte contre les maladies tropicales, la gestion et l'évaluation des programmes de santé publique, la formation du personnel de santé et la lutte contre les pandémies/épidémies (COVID-19, Ebola, Marburg, choléra, fièvre de la Vallée du Rift etc.). Le Dr Diallo est expérimenté dans la fourniture de l’appui technique pour l'élaboration de politiques et de stratégies de lutte contre les maladies transmissibles, de programmes de formation, de dialogue politique et de plaidoyer, y compris la recherche sur les programmes prioritaires de santé publique avec plus de 150 missions de soutien technique et de développement de partenariats dans plus de 30 pays d'Afrique, d'Europe et des Amériques.\n",

      "There are 25.6 million people living with HIV in the African region.East and Southern Africa – 20.8 millionWest and Central Africa – 4.8 millionIn 2022, about 380,000 people died from AIDS related illness in 2022.760,000 newly infected with HIV in 2022HIV infection is often diagnosed through rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), which detect the presence or absence of HIV antibodies. Most often these tests provide same-day test results, which are essential for same-day diagnosis and early treatment and care.Key populations and their sexual partners accounted for over half of all new infections (an estimated 54%) for the first time in 2018.Key populations include: men who have sex with men, people who inject drugs, people in prisons and other closed settings, sex workers and their clients, and transgender people. They are at increased risk of HIV infection irrespective of epidemic type or local context.Key populations, their clients and sexual partners accounted for 64% of new HIV infections in West and Central Africa, and for 25% of new HIV infections in the East and Southern African subregion. Key populations and their partners accounted for around 95% of new HIV infections in eastern Europe and central Asia and in the Middle East and North Africa in 2018.Key populations often face legal and social barriers that increase their vulnerability to HIV and impede their access to prevention, testing and treatment programmes.There is no cure for HIV infection. However, effective antiretroviral (ARV) drugs can control the virus and help prevent transmission so that people with HIV and those at substantial risk, can enjoy healthy, long and productive lives.It is estimated that currently 79% of people with HIV know their status. In 2018, an estimated 23.3 million people living with HIV were receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) globally.Between 2000 and 2018, new HIV infections fell by 37%, and HIV-related deaths fell by 45% with 13.6 million lives saved due to ART in the same period. This achievement was the result of great efforts by national HIV programmes supported by civil society and a range of development partners.\n",

      "No effective cure for HIV exists at present but HIV can be suppressed by a combination of medicines called antiretroviral (ARV) therapy consisting of three or more ARV drugs. Antiretroviral therapy does not cure HIV infection but suppresses viral replication within a person's body and allows an individual's immune system to strengthen and regain the capacity to fight off infections.People with HIV can enjoy long, healthy lives by taking ARV treatment.In 2021, WHO released the Consolidated guidelines on HIV prevention, testing, treatment, service delivery and monitoring: Recommendations for a public health approach. These consolidated guidelines on preventing and treating HIV infection bring together a series of recommendations to promote the highest quality, person- centered delivery of care for people living with HIV and affected by HIVConsolidated guidelines on HIV prevention, testing, treatment, service delivery and monitoring: Recommendations for a public health approachHIV still causes too many avoidable deaths, but by providing the right health services in a timely manner, we can avoid the worst consequences of the virus. The recommendations in these guidelines aim to reduce the number of people dying from HIV and, when fully implemented, will help us to reach our goals of reducing global HIV deaths to less than 200 000 by 2030. For most people living with HIV, it is a chronic, lifelong condition. Evidence and lived experience have shown that with the right support, people are able to manage their own health according to what works best in their lives. The service delivery approaches put forward in these guidelines aim to promote self-management for the majority of people living with or affected by HIV. This includes an expanded range of options for diagnosing, preventing, and treating HIV that are delivered and monitored in the community.Treatment and care in children and adolescentsIn the African region, an estimated 1.3 million children aged 0-14 were living with HIV at the end of 2022, and 109 000 children were newly infected. An estimated 69 000 children died of AIDS-related illnesses. To reduce HIV-related mortality and morbidity among this highly vulnerable population, early testing and treatment is essential. Without access to testing and treatment, 50% of children with HIV will die by the age of 2, and 80% will not live to their fifth birthday.WHO recommends that infants born to mothers living with HIV are tested for HIV, at birth, six weeks, during breastfeeding, and when breastfeeding ends given the continued risk of transmission during this period. Older children, especially offspring and siblings of persons infected with HIV, should also be tested. HIV-positive children should be started on antiretroviral drugs (ARV) immediately. Once treatment begins, children must take their medicine regularly to stay healthy into adolescence and adulthood. Failure to suppress the HIV virus remains a serious problem among children, aggravated by a lack of child-friendly formulations of the newest and most effective ARVs designed for adults.Compared to other populations, adolescents face additional barriers in accessing testing and treatment, including health services that are not adapted to their needs and policies that require parental consent for services. HIV-positive adolescents also are less likely than adults to adhere to their treatment regularly, resulting in lower rates of viral suppression and lower declines in mortality.Addressing the distinct and diverse needs of adolescents living with HIV to improve their HIV-related outcomes requires a comprehensive and integrated approach that leverages on global commitments and approaches to adolescent health, including the Global Strategy for Women, Children, and Adolescents’ Health (2016–2030) and the Global Accelerated Action for the Health of Adolescents (AA-HA!).WHO recommends the implementation of adolescent-friendly health services in HIV services to ensure engagement and improved outcomes. Involving and engaging in their own care across the treatment cascade and through the cycle of planning, implementing, monitoring and evaluating programs is key. Peer-driven, adolescent-friendly services, integrated with other services including psychosocial interventions, are effective ways to improve health outcomes for adolescents.AIDS-free framework to accelerate paediatric and adolescent HIV treatmentHIV Drug ResistanceTens of millions of HIV/AIDS patients have had their lives saved thanks to the extraordinary rise in the use of antiretroviral medication (ART) during the last ten years. Of the estimated 25.6 million people living with HIV in the African region, 20.8 million were on antiretroviral therapy (ART) as of the end of 2022. HIV drug resistance has emerged in tandem with the growing usage of HIV medications; in recent years, the prevalence of this resistance has been progressively rising. Changes in the genetic makeup of HIV impact the medications' capacity to prevent the virus from replicating, leading to HIV drug resistance. Due to the advent of newer kinds of antiretrovirals, all currently available medications have the potential to become partially or completely inactive.Drug-resistant virus strains have the potential to render all antiretroviral medications, including those from more recent classes, partially or completely inert. HIV drug resistance has the potential to compromise antiretroviral medication effectiveness if it is not addressed, leading to a rise in HIV infections as well as higher rates of morbidity and mortality related to HIV.Guidelines on the public health response to pretreatment HIV drug resistanceWHO releases HIV drug resistance report 2021 •    WHO urges action against HIV drug resistance threatPrevention of HIV drug resistanceWHO recommends assessing whether antiretroviral therapy (ART) programmes are delivering services at the quality required, to minimize the emergence of HIV drug resistance. This assessment is achieved with a set of standard quality-of-care indicators known as “early warning indicators” of HIV drug resistance. The early warning indicators use standardized definitions, which have evolved over time as programmes mature and public health actions are refined. The most up-to-date set of early warning indicators for HIV drug resistance are included in the WHO “Consolidated HIV Strategic Information Guidelines” and the HIV Drug Resistance Strategy, 2021 update.Total attrition from ARTPeople living with HIV who have suppressed viral loadViral load testing coverage Timely second viral load testARV medicine stock-outART adherence proxy (ARV refills)Timely switch to second-line ARTConsolidated guidelines on person-centred HIV strategic information: strengthening routine data for impactHIV drug resistance strategy, 2021 update  Policy brief Policy brief on integrating and strengthening monitoring of differentiated ART service deliveryPolicy brief on digital health dataEnhancing the monitoring of HIV testing and treatmentLaboratory network for HIVDRThe WHO HIV drug resistance laboratory network supports HIV drug resistance surveys by providing accurate and timely genotyping results that meet WHO specifications.Its objectives are to ensure:the proper collection, handling, shipment and storage of specimens; andthe availability of quality-assured HIV genotyping laboratory services producing comparable and reliable results at the national, regional and global level.The national HIV drug resistance working groups that coordinate WHO-recommended surveys must use a WHO-designated genotyping laboratory to provide quality-assured testing services for drug resistance surveys.To be designated as a laboratory for WHO surveys, several mandatory criteria must be met including a site inspection and annual external proficiency testing. The roles and responsibilities of network laboratories, recommended testing, internal and external quality assurance procedures, and assay validation recommendations are summarized in the WHO/HIVResNet HIV drug resistance laboratory operational framework.Minimum criteria for external quality assurance proficiency tests for use by laboratories designated by WHO for HIV drug resistance surveillanceTarget product profile for HIV drug resistance tests in low- and middle-income countries: AfricaWHO manual for HIV drug resistance testing using dried blood spot specimensWHO HIVResNet HIV drug resistance laboratory operational framework HIV drug resistance surveillanceGlobal and national policy decisions on antiretroviral therapy and HIV service delivery need to be informed by reliable national data on HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) prevalence and trends. HIV treatment and pre-exposure prophylaxis scale-up should be accompanied by measures to monitor the quality of antiretroviral drug delivery and surveillance of HIVDR.Quality data should be obtained from periodic nationally representative HIVDR surveys among different populations.Laboratory-based survey of acquired HIV drug resistance using remnant viral load specimensClinical-based survey of acquired HIV drug resistanceSentinel surveys of acquired HIV resistance to dolutegravir among people receiving dolutegravir-containing antiretroviral therapySurveillance of pretreatment HIV drug resistance- populations initiating first-line ARTPretreatment HIV drug resistance is detected among people initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) with or without prior antiretroviral drug exposure. It can result from transmitted or acquired HIV drug resistance, or both. Surveillance of the pre-treatment HIV drug resistance survey in populations initiating first-line ART is relevant to inform the choice of nationally recommended first-line ART regimens, and also regimens used for pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis.Surveillance of HIV drug resistance in adults initiating antiretroviral therapy- pre – treatment HIV drug resistanceSurveillance of pretreatment HIV drug resistance- treatment -naïve infants newly diagnosed with HIVThe surveillance of pretreatment HIV drug resistance among treatment-naive infants newly diagnosed with HIV is particularly relevant in settings where many infants acquire HIV infection. Surveillance provides critical information to support optimal choice of first- and second-line antiretroviral therapy regimens.The purpose of this surveillance is to assess the prevalence of HIV drug resistance among treatment-naive infants younger than 18 months (regardless of prevention of mother-to-child transmission exposure), who have been newly diagnosed with HIV using early infant diagnosis over a 12-month period.Surveillance of HIV drug resistance in children newly diagnosed with HIV by early infant diagnosis Surveillance of HIV drug resistance- PrEP users diagnosed with HIVWHO recommends pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) as an additional prevention option for HIV-negative individuals at substantial risk of HIV infection, as part of combination prevention approaches. HIV drug resistance was rarely reported among PrEP users diagnosed with HIV in randomized controlled trials or open-label studies.However, PrEP-selected HIV drug resistance could potentially negatively impact the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy (ART) options among PrEP users who acquire HIV. This is because there is a potential for overlapping resistance profiles between antiretroviral drugs used for both PrEP and first-line ART.Therefore, WHO recommends that PrEP scale-up be accompanied by surveillance of HIV drug resistance, as resistance may compromise the effectiveness of first-line ART among PrEP users who acquire HIV.HIV drug resistance surveillance in countries scaling up pre-exposure prophylaxis \n",

      "The symptoms of HIV vary depending on the stage of infection. Though people living with HIV tend to be most infectious in the first few months, many are unaware of their status until later stages. In the first few weeks after initial infection, individuals may experience no symptoms or an influenza-like illness including fever, headache, rash, or sore throat.As the infection progressively weakens the immune system, an individual can develop other signs and symptoms, such as swollen lymph nodes, weight loss, fever, diarrhoea and cough. Without treatment, they could also develop severe illnesses such as tuberculosis, cryptococcal meningitis, severe bacterial infections and cancers such as lymphomas and Kaposi's sarcoma, among others.Tuberculosis (TB) remains the leading cause of death among people living with HIV, accounting for around one in three AIDS-related deaths.\n",

It is important that these tests be used in combination and in a specific order that has been validated and is based on HIV prevalence of the population being tested.Serological tests, such as rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) or enzyme immunoassays (EIAs), detect antibodies produced by an individual as part of their immune system to fight off foreign pathogens, rather than direct detection of HIV itself.Most individuals develop antibodies to HIV within 28 days of infection and therefore antibodies may not be detectable early, during the so-called “window period”. This early period of infection represents the time of greatest infectivity; however, HIV transmission can occur during all stages of the infection.It is best practice to also retest all people initially diagnosed as HIV-positive before they enrol in care and/or treatment to rule out any potential testing or reporting error. Notably, once a person diagnosed with HIV has started treatment, they should not be retested.Testing and diagnosis of HIV-exposed infants has been a challenge because babies carry their biological mothers’ antibodies and it can take months for these to disappear. For infants and children less than 18 months of age, serological testing is not sufficient to identify HIV infection: virologic testing must be provided (at 6 weeks of age, or at birth) to detect the presence of the virus in infants born to mothers living with HIV.\n",

It is important that these tests be used in combination and in a specific order as in the approved national algorithm.HIV testing should be voluntary – a person has the right to refuse to be tested. Mandatory or coerced testing by a health care provider, authority, or by a partner or family member is not acceptable as it undermines good public health practice and infringes on human rights.Serological tests, such as rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) or enzyme immunoassays (EIAs), detect antibodies produced by an individual as part of their immune system to fight off foreign pathogens, rather than direct detection of HIV itself.Most individuals develop antibodies to HIV within 28 days of infection and therefore antibodies may not be detectable early, during the so-called “window period”.

For infants and children less than 18 months of age, serological testing is not sufficient to identify HIV infection: virologic testing must be provided (at 6 weeks of age, or at birth) to detect the presence of the virus in infants born to mothers living with HIV.HIV self-testing – is an approach where a person collects his or her own specimen (oral fluid or blood) and then performs an HIV test and interprets the result, often in a private setting, either alone or with someone he or she trusts.Consolidated guidelines on HIV prevention, testing, treatment, service delivery and monitoring: Recommendations for a public health approachLaboratory and point-of-care diagnostic testing for sexually transmitted infections, including HIVPolicy briefsWHO encourages countries to adapt HIV testing strategies in response to changing epidemicWHO recommends HIV self-testing evidence update and considerations for successConsolidated guidelines on HIV testing services for a changing epidemicWhat works for generating demand for HIV testing servicesDual HIV/Syphilis rapid diagnostic tests can be used as the first test in antenatal careWHO recommends social network-based HIV testing approaches for key populations as part of partner services packageWHO recommends countries move away from the western blotting and line immunoassays in HIV testing strategies and algorithms ToolkitTool to optimize HIV testing algorithms\n",

It is fatal if undetected or untreated and is the leading cause of death among people with HIV, responsible for more than one out of three HIV-associated deaths.Early detection of TB and prompt linkage to TB treatment and ART can prevent these deaths. TB screening should be offered routinely at HIV care services and routine HIV testing should be offered to all patients with presumptive and diagnosed TB. Individuals who are diagnosed with HIV and active TB should urgently start effective TB treatment (including for multidrug-resistant TB) and ART. TB preventive therapy should be offered to all people with HIV who do not have active TB.\n",

      "Voluntary medical male circumcision for HIV preventionReaching the 2030 HIV incidence goals in high-burden settings, particularly in Eastern and Southern Africa, and then keeping HIV incidence at low levels, will require the right combination of effective prevention interventions at high coverage levels.In 2007, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS and WHO recommended voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) to reduce the risk of men acquiring HIV infection during heterosexual exposure. The recommendation was based on strong evidence from randomized controlled trials showing an approximately 60% lower risk.Since 2007, more than 27 million VMMC procedures have been performed in the 15 priority countries in Eastern and Southern Africa, where about half of all new HIV infections occurred. In the past 10 years, other evidence-based HIV prevention options have also been scaled up, including oral pre-exposure prophylaxis and HIV antiretroviral therapy (with its secondary HIV prevention effect), along with already known interventions, such as condom use and post-exposure prophylaxis.In the ongoing effort to end the AIDS epidemic, a re-examination of the evidence shows that VMMC remains an important intervention, alongside other effective behavioural and biomedical HIV prevention interventions. VMMC should be supported as a key HIV prevention option, within combination prevention for adolescents 15 years and older and adult men in settings with generalized HIV epidemics.Preventing HIV through safe voluntary medical male circumcision for adolescent boys and men in generalized HIV epidemics: recommendations and key considerations.Assessing and enhancing sustainable voluntary medical male circumcision services for HIV prevention in East and Southern Africa: a landscape report of voluntary medical male circumcision priority countries \n",

Oral PrEP is highly effective at preventing HIV when used as directed. In 2021, WHO recommended that the dapivirine ring may be offered as an additional prevention choice for women at substantial risk of HIV and, in 2022, that long-acting injectable cabotegravir (CAB-LA) may be offered as an additional prevention choice for people at substantial risk of HIV.

      "              \n",
      "\n",
      "In the African region, a number of women and girls living with HIV become pregnant each year. In the absence of intervention, the rate of transmission of HIV from a mother living with HIV to her child during pregnancy, labour, delivery or breastfeeding ranges from 15% to 45%. As such, identification of HIV infection should be immediately followed by an offer of linkage to lifelong treatment and care, including support to remain in care and virally suppressed and an offer of partner services. Elimination of MTCT of HIV is strongly supported by global commitments and the promotion of integration of prevention of MTCT interventions into maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health services, as well as strengthened health systems. In addition, improved access to sexual and reproductive health services – including preventing unintended pregnancies and screening and treatment for sexually transmitted infections in women and girls living with HIV – is being actively promoted.The integration of interventions has led to the triple elimination initiative, which not only promotes person-centered care, but also reduces incidence, morbidity and mortality. The initiative also strengthens disease monitoring using strategic information for response planning. Essential triple EMTCT services include:Testing for HIV, syphilis and HBV in antenatal care clinics.Prompt and efficacious interventions to treat women who test positive, and to prevent transmission of the infection(s) to their children.Counselling for women and their partners to reduce transmission risk and ensure appropriate treatment.Appropriately attended, safe delivery.Appropriate follow-up of exposed infants, including HBV vaccine birth dose.Optimal infant feeding; andLifelong treatment and care for mothers living with HIV, or eligible for treatment for HBV or syphilis.WHO continues to work in this area, supporting countries to improve and better monitor interventions towards ending the AIDS epidemic as a public health threat by 2030.Validation of elimination of mother-to -child transmission of HIV, syphilis and hepatitis BThe global and regional community has committed itself to the elimination of mother-to-child transmission (EMTCT) of HIV, syphilis, and hepatitis B virus (HBV) as a public health priority. The Triple EMTCT initiative focuses on a harmonized approach to improving health outcomes for mothers and children.The term validation is used to attest that a country has successfully met the criteria for EMTCT of HIV, syphilis, and HBV. WHO develops and regularly updates guidance on the criteria and processes for validation of EMTCT of HIV, syphilis and HBV. Since 2015, Member States have been able to apply for validation for achieving the reduction of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) to a level where it is no longer a public health threat or problem. In 2017, the Path to Elimination was introduced to recognize countries with high prevalence of maternal HIV, syphilis or HBV in their efforts to reduce MTCT.Achieving validation of EMTCT is a tremendous national accomplishment, requiring country-led accountability, rigorous data analysis, intensive programme assessment and multilevel collaboration. Maintaining validation is equally important and requires sustained, broad programme efforts to prevent new infections in infants, children and adults. Through the validation process, WHO and partners continue to provide country support for strengthening health system capacity and comprehensive person-centered, integrated services that respect and protect the human rights of women living with any of the conditions, and to ensure that these women are meaningfully involved in health programme planning and service delivery.Global guidance on criteria and processes for validation: elimination of mother -to-child transmission of HIV, syphilis and hepatitis B.Governance for the validation of elimination of mother to child transmission of HIV, syphilis and hepatitis B virus: an overview of validation structures and responsibilities at national, regional and global levels\n",

      "Alcohol is a psychoactive substance with dependence-producing properties that has been widely used in many cultures for centuries. The harmful use of alcohol causes a large disease, social and economic burden in societies. Environmental factors such as economic development, culture, availability of alcohol and the level and effectiveness of alcohol policies are relevant factors in explaining differences and historical trends in alcohol consumption and related harm.Alcohol-related harm is determined by the volume of alcohol consumed, the pattern of drinking, and, on rare occasions, the quality of alcohol consumed. The harmful use of alcohol is a component cause of more than 200 disease and injury conditions in individuals, most notably alcohol dependence, liver cirrhosis, cancers and injuries. The latest causal relationships established are those between alcohol consumption and incidence of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS.A wide range of effective global, regional and national policies and interventions are in place to reduce the harmful use of alcohol, with a promising trend over the past few decades.Alcohol consumption:Worldwide consumption in 2010 was equal to 6.2 litres of pure alcohol consumed per person aged 15 years or older, which translates into 13.5 grams of pure alcohol per day.A quarter of this consumption (24.8%) was unrecorded, i.e., homemade alcohol, illegally produced or sold outside normal government controls. Of total recorded alcohol consumed worldwide, 50.1% was consumed in the form of spirits.Worldwide 61.7% of the population aged 15 years or older (15+) had not drunk alcohol in the past 12 months. In all WHO regions, females are more often lifetime abstainers than males. There is a considerable variation in prevalence of abstention across WHO regions.Worldwide about 16.0% of drinkers aged 15 years or older engage in heavy episodic drinking.In general, the greater the economic wealth of a country, the more alcohol is consumed and the smaller the number of abstainers. High-income countries have the highest alcohol per capita consumption (APC) and the highest prevalence of heavy episodic drinking among drinkers.Health consequencesIn 2012, about 3.3 million net deaths, or 5.9% of all global deaths, were attributable to alcohol consumption.There are significant sex differences in the proportion of global deaths attributable to alcohol, for example, in 2012 7.6% of deaths among males and 4% of deaths among females were attributable to alcohol.In 2012 139 million net DALYs (disability-adjusted life years), or 5.1% of the global burden of disease and injury, were attributable to alcohol consumption.There is also wide geographical variation in the proportion of alcohol-attributable deaths and DALYs, with the highest alcohol-attributable fractions reported in the WHO European Region.Policies and interventionsAlcohol policies are developed with the aim of reducing harmful use of alcohol and the alcohol-attributable health and social burden in a population and in society. Such policies can be formulated at the global, regional, multinational, national and subnational level.Delegations from all 193 Member States of WHO reached consensus at the World Health Assembly in 2010 on a WHO Global stratgy to reduce the harmful use of alcohol.Many WHO Member States have demonstrated increased leadership and commitment to reducing harmful use of alcohol over the past years.A significantly higher percentage of the reporting countries indicated having written national alcohol policies and imposing stricter blood alcohol concentration limits in 2012 than in 2008.\n",

Globally, cannabis is the most commonly used (129-190 million people), followed by amphetamine type stimulants, then cocaine and opioids.The use of psychoactive substances causes significant health and social problems for the people who use them, and also for others in their families and communities. WHO estimated that 0.7% of the global burden of disease in 2004 was due to cocaine and opioid use, with the social cost of illicit substance use being in the region of 2% of GDP in those countries which have measured it.\n",

The economic costs are also significant.  Between 1965 and 1990, countries in which a large proportion of the population lived in regions with malaria experienced an average growth in per-capita GDP of 0.4% per year, whereas average growth in other countries was 2.3% per year.\n",

      "\n",
      "RationaleThe WHO Global technical strategy for malaria 2016–2030, provides a technical framework for all malaria-endemic countries. It is intended to guide and support regional and country programmes as they work towards malaria control and elimination. The strategy sets ambitious but achievable global targets, including:reducing malaria mortality rates by at least 90% by 2030reducing malaria case incidence by at least 90% by 2030eliminating malaria in at least 35 countries by 2030preventing a resurgence of malaria in all countries that are malaria-free.How far is the WHO African Region to achieve the above targets?   Key messagesAnalysis of the trends shows that, in 2022, the WHO African Region was off track for both the malaria morbidity and mortality GTS milestones.In 2022, an estimated 580 479 people lost their lives due to malaria in the WHO African Region, which represented 95.4% of total deaths globally, including 78.1% of deaths in children under five compared with 90.7% in 2000.In 2022, an estimated 233 million cases of malaria in the WHO African Region, which represented 93.6% of total cases globallyBetween 2019 and 2022, there were substantial increases in estimated case numbers in Nigeria (5.3 million), Ethiopia (2.4 million), Madagascar (1.5 million), Uganda (1.3 million), the United Republic of Tanzania (1.3 million), Mali (1.1 million) and Mozambique (1 million). Over the same period, Rwanda saw a decrease of more than 3.8 million cases.Cabo Verde was certified malaria-free.Reduction of malaria mortality rates The WHO African Region, with an estimated 233 million cases in 2022, accounted for about 94% of cases globally.Twenty-nine countries accounted for 95% of malaria cases globally. Four countries – Nigeria (27%), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (12%), Uganda (5%) and Mozambique (4%) – accounted for almost half of all cases globally.Burden of malaria in pregnancyIn 2022, in 33 moderate and high transmission countries in the WHO African Region, there were an estimated 35.4 million pregnancies, of which 12.7 million (36%) were exposed to malaria infection during pregnancy.By WHO subregion, prevalence of exposure to malaria during pregnancy in 2022 was highest in west Africa (39.3%) and central Africa (40.1%), and lower in the east and southern Africa subregion (27.0%).Malaria cases and deaths avertedGlobally, an estimated 2.1 billion malaria cases and 11.7 million malaria deaths were averted in the period 2000–2022.Most of the cases and deaths averted were in the WHO African Region (cases 82%, deaths 94%), followed by the WHO South-East Asia Region (cases 10%, deaths 3%).Burden of malaria in pregnancy In 2022, in 33 moderate and high transmission countries in the WHO African Region, there were an estimated 35.4 million pregnancies, of which 12.7 million (36%) were exposed to malaria infection during pregnancy.By WHO subregion, prevalence of exposure to malaria during pregnancy in 2022 was highest in west Africa (39.3%) and central Africa (40.1%), and lower in the east and southern Africa subregion (27.0%).It is estimated that, without a pregnancy-specific intervention, malaria infection during pregnancy in these 33 countries would have resulted in 914 000 neonates with low birthweight, compared with about 393 000 neonates with low birthweight estimated at the current intermittent preventive treatment during pregnancy (IPTp) coverage levels in the three subregions.Malaria EliminationOver time, the elimination of malaria has gained momentum in numerous countries as they approach the milestone of zero indigenous malaria cases and as more countries are certified malaria free.Despite the setbacks, several countries and one territory saw notable reductions in indigenous transmission: Botswana (43.5%), the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (9.3%), Ecuador (38.0%), Eswatini (57.6%), French Guiana (71.6%), Mexico (32.6%) and South Africa (31.3%).Investments in malaria programmes and researchThe GTS sets out estimates of the funding required to achieve milestones for 2025 and 2030. Total annual resources needed were estimated at US$ 6.8 billion in 2020, rising to US$ 9.3 billion in 2025 and US$ 10.3 billion by 2030. An additional US$ 0.85 billion is estimated to be required annually for global malaria research and development (R&D) during the period 2021–2030.Governments of malaria endemic countries contributed more than a third of total funding in 2022, with investments of over US$ 1.5 billion, of which nearly US$ 0.4 billion was spent on malaria case management in the public sector and over US$ 1.1 billion on other malaria control activities. This was a substantial increase of over US$ 0.4 billion since 2021, largely stemming from an influx of domestic spending in the WHO African Region.Distribution and coverage of malaria preventionBy 2022, 70% of households in sub-Saharan Africa had at least one ITN, increasing from about 5% in 2000. The percentage of households owning at least one ITN for every two people increased from 1% in 2000 to 40% in 2022. In the same period, the percentage of the population with access to an ITN within their household increased from 3% to 56%.Distribution and coverage of malaria diagnosis and treatmentGlobally, 3.9 billion rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for malaria were sold by manufacturers in 2010–2022, with 82% of these sales being in sub-Saharan African countries. In the same period, NMPs distributed 2.9 billion RDTs – 90% in sub-Saharan Africa.Between 2000 and 2019, case incidence in the WHO African Region decreased from 370 to 226 per 1000 population at risk, but increased to 232 per 1000 population at risk in 2020, mainly because of disruptions to services during the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2022, case incidence declined to 223 per 1000 population at risk.Cabo Verde reported zero indigenous cases for 4 consecutive years, ending its malaria epidemic.Malaria deathsAbout 96% of malaria deaths globally were in 29 countries. Four countries accounted for just over half of all malaria deaths globally in 2022 – Nigeria (31%), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (12%), Niger (6%) and the United Republic of Tanzania (4%).Malaria deaths in the WHO African Region decreased from 808 000 in 2000 to 548 000 in 2017, before increasing to 604 000 in 2020. Estimated deaths decreased again to 580 000 in 2022. The malaria mortality rate decreased by 60% between 2000 and 2019, from 143 to 57 deaths per 100 000 population at risk, before rising to 61 in 2020 and decreasing again to 56 in 2022.Cabo Verde has reported zero malaria deaths since 2018.  Malaria cases and deaths avertedGlobally, an estimated 2.1 billion malaria cases and 11.7 million malaria deaths were averted in the period 2000–2022.Most of the cases and deaths averted were in the WHO African Region (cases 82%, deaths 94%), followed by the WHO South-East Asia Region (cases 10%, deaths 3%).Malaria Estimated Cases In the African Region, WHO 2023Estimated prevalence of exposure to malaria infection during pregnancy, overall and by subregion in 2022, in moderate to high transmission countries in the WHO African Region Sources: Imperial College and WHO estimate Estimated number of children with low birthweight (WMR 2023)    InterventionPregnant women attending antenatal care  at least once and receiving at least 3 doses of Intermittent Preventive Treatment of Malaria for Pregnant Women (IPTp3) (%)     in the African Region, WHO 2021Number of ITN delivered by manufacturers and distributed by NMPs, 2010-2023Indicators of population level access to ITNs, sub-Saharian Africa, 2000-2022 and b) indicators of population-level use of ITNs, sub-Saharan Africa, 2000-2022, Source; ITN coverage model by the Malaria Atlas Project. Indicators of population level access to ITNs, sub-Saharian Africa, 2000-2022 and b) indicators of population-level use of ITNs, sub-Saharan Africa, 2000-2022, Source; ITN coverage model by the Malaria Atlas Project. Percentage of pregnant women attending an ANC clinic at least once and receiving IPTp, by number of SP doses, sub-Saharan Africa, 2010–2022 Sources: NMP reports, CDC and WHO estimates  \n",

      "Safe and readily available water is important for public health, whether it is used for drinking, domestic use, food production or recreational purposes. Improved water supply and sanitation, and better management of water resources, can boost countries’ economic growth and can contribute greatly to poverty reduction.\n",
      "In 2010, the UN General Assembly explicitly recognised the human right to water and sanitation. Everyone has the right to sufficient, continuous, safe, acceptable, physically accessible and affordable water for personal and domestic use.\n",

      "The Millennium Development Goal (MDG 7) on drinking-water was met globally in 2010. The target was to halve the proportion of the world’s population without sustainable access to safe water. The 48 least developed countries did not meet the target, but substantial progress has been made with 42 per cent of the current population in these countries gaining access to improved drinking-water sources since 1990.\n",
      "Sharp geographic, sociocultural and economic inequalities persist, not only between rural and urban areas but also in towns and cities where people living in low-income, informal or illegal settlements usually have less access to improved sources of drinking-water than other residents.\n",

      "\n",
      "Contaminated water and poor sanitation are linked to transmission of diseases such as cholera, diarrhoea, dysentery, hepatitis A, typhoid and polio. Absent, inadequate, or inappropriately managed water and sanitation services expose individuals to preventable health risks. This is particularly the case in health care facilities where both patients and staff are placed at additional risk of infection and disease when water, sanitation and hygiene services are lacking. Globally, 15% of patients develop an infection during a hospital stay, with the proportion much greater in low-income countries.\n",
      "Inadequate management of urban, industrial and agricultural wastewater means the drinking-water of hundreds of millions of people is dangerously contaminated or chemically polluted.\n",
      "Some 842 000 people are estimated to die each year from diarrhoea as a result of unsafe drinking-water, sanitation and hand hygiene. But diarrhoea is largely preventable, and the deaths of 361 000 children aged under 5 each year could be avoided each year if these risk factors were addressed. Where water is not readily available, people may decide handwashing is not a priority, thereby adding to the likelihood of diarrhoea and other diseases.\n",
      "Diarrhoea is the most widely known disease linked to contaminated food and water but there are other hazards. Almost 240 million people are affected by schistosomiasis – an acute and chronic disease caused by parasitic worms contracted through exposure to infested water.\n",
      "In many parts of the world, insects that live or breed in water carry and transmit diseases such as dengue fever. Some of these insects, known as vectors, breed in clean, rather than dirty water, and household drinking-water containers can serve as breeding grounds. The simple intervention of covering water storage containers can reduce vector breeding and may also have a co-benefit of reducing faecal contamination of water at the household level.\n",

      "When water comes from improved and more accessible sources, people spend less time and effort in physically collecting it, meaning they can be productive in other ways. It can also result in greater personal safety by reducing the need to make long or risky journeys to collect water. Better water sources also mean less expenditure on health, as people are less likely to fall ill and incur medical costs, and are better able to remain economically productive.\n",
      "With children particularly at risk from water-related diseases, access to improved sources of water can result in better health and therefore better school attendance, with longer-term consequences for their lives.\n",

At least 1.8 billion people use a drinking-water source that is contaminated with faecal matter. A substantial proportion of water supplied through pipes is contaminated, especially where water supply is intermittent or treatment is inadequate. Even where the source is good, water can be contaminated while being transported or stored, especially in environments where sanitation is inadequate.\n",

By 2025, half of the world’s population will be living in water-stressed areas. Re-use of wastewater, to recover water, nutrients, or energy, is becoming an important strategy. Increasingly countries are using wastewater for irrigation – in developing countries this represents 7% of irrigated land. While this practice if done inappropriately poses health risks, safe management of wastewater can yield multiple benefits, including increased food production.\n",
      "Options for water sources used for drinking-water and irrigation will continue to evolve, with an increasing reliance on groundwater and alternative sources, including wastewater. Climate change will lead to greater fluctuations in harvested rainwater. Management of all water resources will need to be improved to ensure provision and quality.\n",

      "As the international authority on public health and water quality, WHO leads global efforts to prevent transmission of waterborne disease, advising governments on the development of health-based targets and regulations.\n",
      "WHO produces a series of water quality guidelines, including on drinking-water, safe use of wastewater, and safe recreational water environments. The water quality guidelines are based on managing risks, and since 2004 the Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality included the promotion of Water Safety Plans to identify and prevent risks before water is contaminated. In 2015, WHO introduced the concept of Sanitation Safety Plans to support implementation of the wastewater guidelines. WHO works on promoting effective risk assessment and management practices among all groups, including suppliers of drinking water, wastewater treatment companies, farmers, communities and individuals.\n",
      "Since 2014, WHO has been testing household water treatment products against WHO health-based performance criteria through the WHO International ‘Scheme’ to Evaluate Household Water Treatment Technologies. The aim of the Scheme is to ensure that products distributed protect users from the pathogens that cause diarrhoeal disease and to strengthen policy, regulatory, and monitoring mechanisms at the national level to support appropriate targeting and consistent and correct use of such products.\n",
      "WHO works closely with UNICEF in a number of areas concerning water and health. For example, the integrated global action plan to end preventable child deaths from pneumonia and diarrhoea by 2025 (GAPPD) sets out several prevention and treatment targets, including achieving universal access to drinking water in health care facilities and homes by 2030. The means of implementation for the work in health care facilities cuts across several health areas, including quality universal health coverage, and the two agencies have established a work plan to incrementally work towards universal access at the facility, national and global level.\n",

      "Abuja, 27 February, 2025 - The World Health Organization (WHO) has reaffirmed its commitment to supporting Nigeria's government in strengthening Primary Health Care (PHC) and addressing health system issues by implementing innovative initiatives. This commitment aligns with the country's goal to eliminate all types of polioviruses by the end of 2025.WHO Country Representative in Nigeria, Dr Walter Kazadi Mulombo, said at the recently concluded First Quarter Review Meeting of the Northern Traditional Leaders Committee (NTLC) on PHC Delivery in Abuja.Earlier in his opening remark, the Coordinating Minister of Health and Social Welfare, Professor Muhammad Pate, had appreciated the council's tenacity in mobilizing their communities and overseeing polio vaccination campaigns towards eradication of the disease in the country. An urgent clarion callProfessor Pate urged the traditional leaders not to rest on their oars. He emphasized the urgent need to eliminate the circulating variant poliovirus type 2 (cVPV2) transmission in the country by December 2025.Professor Pate called on the traditional leaders to double their efforts by leveraging their influence to strengthen community trust and participation in immunization efforts.\"This council has remained the most steadfast primary healthcare structure in Nigeria, Africa, and possibly the world. For 16 consecutive years, you have convened quarterly meetings without fail. Delivering his goodwill message, Dr Mulombo also set the tone with a call to action, lauding the Nigerian government's and traditional leaders' unwavering commitment and underscoring their critical role in championing the fight against polio in Nigeria. \"While 2024 has been a challenging year for Nigeria's polio program, we have the opportunity to turn things around, and now is the best time to act urgently and decisively to end cVPV2 in the country. WHO is committed to supporting Nigeria in addressing the challenges, even in the face of geopolitical complexities\", said Dr Mulombo.The Country Representative also pledged WHO's support in fast-tracking the accreditation of the Ibadan polio laboratory while announcing that the laboratory is fully accredited to conduct polio sequencing.The polio laboratory in Ibadan, established in 1993, is one of the iconic polio laboratories in Nigeria that can detect, identify, and promptly report wild polioviruses (WPV), cVPVD2, as well as other enteroviruses that may be present in clinical and environmental specimens.Tackling Challenges with Renewed CommitmentDespite the progress made, Nigeria is still reporting cases of cVPVD2. Dr Muyi Aina, Executive Director of the National Primary Healthcare Development Agency (NPHCDA),  pointed out some of the challenges deterring the nation from achieving its polio eradication goal said, \"For too long, we have struggled with issues like noncompliance, vaccine hesitancy, missed children, security concerns, inadequate routine immunization coverage, data falsification and malnutrition. We need to push beyond our limitations and ensure that no child is left unvaccinated. We need the support of the NTLC members, as community engagement is key to achieving success. We must rewrite the story this year,\" said Dr Muyi.Traditional Leaders Vow to Strengthen EffortsIn his remark, Alhaji Sama'ila Muhammad Mera, the Emir of Argungu, who double as the NTLC chair, expressed gratitude to the government and partners for their continued support. The Emir called on his fellow traditional leaders to collaborate with religious figures and community influencers to drive vaccination demand.Raising concerns over the suboptimal performance of routine immunization in the country's North Central and North West geopolitical regions in 2024, he said, \"The time has come for us to end polio once and for all. Every unvaccinated child is a risk to all children in our communities. We must strengthen newborn and defaulter tracking systems to ensure every child receives the necessary vaccines. We must play an active role in planning and supervising immunization sessions,\" the Emir urged.The Emir welcomed the strategic shifts introduced by the government, including increased accountability, localized advocacy, improved data integration, and synchronized campaign efforts. A Unified Effort to End PolioThe NTLC's quarterly meetings serve as a vital platform for reviewing progress and tackling challenges in polio eradication, routine immunization, maternal and child health, and primary healthcare service delivery.The latest gathering featured presentations on the state of Nigeria's polio program, updates on routine immunization, maternal and newborn health, and the introduction of the rubella vaccine. Participants also discussed previous meeting resolutions, with various partners delivering goodwill messages.\n",

      "Kampala/Uganda: The Uganda Ministry of Health (MOH), with support from the World Health Organization (WHO) and partners deployed the national Emergency Medical Team (nEMT) to the ongoing Sudan Virus Disease (SVD) response. On 30 January 2025, MOH declared an outbreak of SVD in the country after a 35-year-old Ugandan male who worked as a nurse in Mulago National Referral Hospital tested positive for the virus following his death on 29 January 2025. Before his diagnosis, he sought treatment at multiple health facilities, including Mulago Referral Hospital in Kampala, Saidina Abubakar Islamic Hospital in Matugga in Wakiso District, and Mbale Regional Referral Hospital in Mbale City.By 2 February 2025, Uganda had recorded a total of nine confirmed cases. This includes the index case and eight additional confirmed cases from three different districts. This brings the total to nine cases (one mortality and eight recoveries).  In response, the Ministry of Health swiftly deployed the national Emergency Medical Team to support case management. A total of 44 national Emergency Medical Team members of various cadres were deployed. A team of 26 was deployed to support the operationalization of Mulago National Referral Hospital, while 18 were deployed to Mbale district Ebola treatment unit. This marked the first time that the country has deployed the national EMT for an Ebola response. At Mulago hospital, the nEMT members were on ground within two hours of deployment, immediately  setting up the isolation unit and preparing to receive patients. Their support included providing direct clinical care according to national Ebola case management guidelines, strengthening referral systems to evacuate new cases from the community promptly, and building capacity of the local teams through training and mentorship. In Mbale, the team was deployed on Monday 3 February 2025 to strengthen the isolation unit set-up and support clinical care. The Mbale team consisted of 18 members including physicians, nurses, a logistician, Infection Prevention and Control officer, plus a safe and dignified burial team. “In previous outbreaks, we relied on mobilization of health workers across the country, working alongside surge teams from outside the country. However, this time, we had a fully trained, readily deployable trained team who were on-site within two hours of deployment and fully constituted within 12 hours. As a country, this is a proud moment for us,” said Dr Rony Bahatungire, Ag. Commissioner - Clinical Services and national EMT focal person. Beyond clinical care, the nEMT has played a critical role in providing mental health and psycho-social services to health workers, patients and their communities including affected schools. Mentorship and training were extended to existing health workers within the local systems, to ensure sustainable support to survivors’ resettlement.  Sudan Virus Disease outbreaks have reported a mortality rate between 41% to 70% in previous outbreaks. The last outbreak in the country recorded a mortality rate of 47%. However, the EVD mortality rate during this response has been 11.1%, and this was the index case. The response has recorded a 100% survival rate for all patients admitted to the isolation units. This is due to multiple reasons including the rapid deployment of an experienced EMT that has maintained the high standard of care.Since their deployment on 30 January 2025, the team has maintained 24-hour coverage, providing optimized clinical care. This included early supportive care across the spectrum from mild cases to provision of critical care. They have managed a total of eight confirmed cases and numerous suspects. To date, no mortality has been reported in either of the isolation units, despite managing some severe and critical cases including children. “Public health emergencies can quickly overwhelm the local health systems, necessitating additional support. Fortunately, the national EMTs understand the local context and are readily deployable to support affected communities,” said Dr Kasonde Mwinga, the WHO Representative to Uganda.Uganda currently has 149 nEMT members, ready to respond to public health emergencies.  The nEMT concept dates to December 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic. At the time, MOH, with support from WHO, hosted the first regional training for nEMT members to support the COVID-19 response. MOH continued to build the team through additional trainings and drills supported by WHO with funding from partners like the European Union Humanitarian Aid Agency (DG ECHO), the Robert Koch Institute and Malteser International among others. The nEMT has also previously deployed for Mpox and measles outbreaks within the country. In July 2024, Uganda’s Ministry of Health approved the nEMT roadmap to guide future emergency response efforts. This aligns with the WHO global EMT initiative, which aims to improve the speed and quality of emergency medical response while strengthening national health systems.“The work that we do is not only about responding to outbreaks. Preparedness is an important part of our work. The Uganda national EMTs program has shown the importance of preparedness and its impact on response.” Dr Michael Ryan, Deputy Director General and Head - World Health Emergencies, WHO Headquarters, Geneva.   \n",

      "Kinshasa – Health authorities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and experts from World Health Organization (WHO) are carrying out further investigations to determine the cause of another cluster of illness and community deaths in Equateur province. In recent months, disease surveillance has identified increases in illness and deaths three times in different areas of the country, and triggered follow-up investigations to confirm the cause and provide needed support.  Since the beginning of 2025, a series of illnesses and community deaths have affected Equateur province. The most recent cluster occurred in the Basankusu health zone, where last week 141 additional people fell ill, with no deaths reported. In the same health zone, 158 cases and 58 deaths were reported in the same health zone earlier in February. In January, Bolamba health zone reported 12 people who fell ill including 8 deaths. Increased disease surveillance has identified in total of 1096 sick people and 60 deaths in Basankusu and Bolomba fitting a broad case definition that includes fever, headache, chills, sweating, stiff neck, muscle aches, multiple joint pain and body aches, a runny or bleeding from nose, cough, vomiting and diarrhoea.  The Democratic Republic of the Congo is facing many concurrent crises and outbreaks, putting a further strain on the health sector and the population. In response to the latest cluster of illness, a national rapid response team from Kinshasa and Equateur including WHO health emergency experts was deployed to Basankusu and Bolomba health zones to investigate the situation and determine if there is an unusual pattern. The experts are stepping up disease surveillance, conducting interviews with community members to understand the background, and providing treatment for diseases such as malaria, typhoid fever and meningitis.  WHO has delivered emergency medical supplies, including testing kits, and developed detailed protocols to enhance disease investigation. Initial laboratory analysis has turned out negative for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus disease. Around half of the samples tested positive for malaria, which is common in the region. Further tests are to be carried out for meningitis. Food, water and environmental samples will also be analysed, to determine if there might be contamination. The various samples will be sent for further testing at the national reference laboratory in Kinshasa. Earlier samples turned out not to be viable and re-testing was undertaken.  Basankusu and Bolomba are about 180 kilometres apart and more than 300 kilometres from the provincial capital Mbandaka. The two localities are reachable by road or via the Congo River from Mbandaka. This remoteness limits access to health care, including testing and treatment. Poor road and telecommunication infrastructure are also major challenges. WHO is supporting the local health authorities reinforce investigation and response measures, with more than 80 community health workers trained to detect and report cases and deaths.   Further efforts are needed to reinforce testing, early case detection and reporting, for the current event but also for future incidents. WHO remains on the ground supporting health worker, collaborating closely with zonal, provincial and national health authorities to provide lifesaving medical supplies and to coordinate response to curb the spread of the illness and other outbreaks in the region. \n",

      "\n",
      "26 February 2025\n",
      "\n",
      "In the war-torn streets of Kabul, bombed-out buildings stood as stark reminders of a life disrupted. Families, including one young boy's, struggled to rebuild amidst the chaos. For this boy, survival was not the only battle; his greatest fight was for an education.School was a fragile promise. On some days, there were no classrooms—just open spaces where children sat on the dirt, balancing books on their knees. Other days, the threat of violence kept them at home. When they did manage to attend school, they faced a shortage of teachers and materials. Yet, they held onto hope. Hope that education could be their escape. Hope that someone, somewhere, believed in their potential.That belief came from the United Nations and international organizations. These entities stepped in, providing books, rebuilding classrooms, and most importantly, instilling the belief that these children's futures mattered. Thanks to their efforts, the boy completed high school and graduated from Kabul Medical University in Afghanistan.Decades later, this boy, Amran Mohammad Yosuf, found himself on the other side of the story-now working with the World Health Organization (WHO) as a Technical Officer in the Uganda Country Office. His work takes him across borders, from one emergency to another. It was in Kitgum, northern Uganda, that his past and present converged.While in Kitgum last year, Yosuf visited a school where children sat on the ground, just as he once had. There were no desks, no proper classrooms—only the children's unwavering determination to learn. The sight struck a deep chord within him. In their faces, he saw his younger self: a boy with dreams far bigger than his circumstances.This experience highlights a profound truth; experience shapes not only who we are but also how we serve others. His journey had come full circle. He was no longer just a doctor or a health professional; he was someone who had once sat in the same dust, felt the same hunger for opportunity, and known the impact of compassion from strangers.Empathy, he realized, is crucial in global health. Data and strategies are important, but they mean nothing if the human beings behind them are forgotten. He knew firsthand what it was like to be on the receiving end of international aid—not as a statistic, but as a child whose life was transformed because someone cared enough to act.This is why organizations like WHO and the UN must continue their work. They are not just responding to crises; they are shaping futures. Yosuf's life was living proof of that.But this story is not just about Yosuf. It is about every child in Kitgum, in Kabul, and in countless other places where potential waits to be nurtured. Their futures depend on whether the world chooses to invest in them or turn away.The global community cannot afford to turn away. Continued support for WHO, the UN, and other organizations fighting to give children a chance is essential. Every act of support—no matter how small—does not just change lives. It creates doctors, leaders, and changemakers who will one day stand where Yousef stands today.Because sometimes, the children invested in today will be the ones who shape the world tomorrow. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "26 February 2025\n",
      "\n",
      "Juba - The ongoing conflict in Sudan has forced more than 160,000 people to seek refuge in South Sudan since mid-December 2024, placing immense pressure on an already overstretched healthcare system. Renk County, particularly its border town and surrounding villages, has become the primary destination for these displaced individuals, exacerbating existing health challenges.Renk County Hospital remains a vital lifeline for trauma care. As violence intensifies near the Sudan-South Sudan border, the hospital is struggling to cope with a surge in casualties. In response, the World Health Organization (WHO), in partnership with humanitarian organizations, has established a temporary trauma center. This facility, equipped with 60 beds, a triage area, an operating theater, and a post-operative ward, has provided critical support. However, the overwhelming demand for surgical interventions—exceeding 300 cases of injuries from armed violence —continues to strain resources and health care personnel.“The number of patients seeking care in Renk Hospital is increasing daily. We are attending to over 250 outpatients and more than 100 inpatients each day, far exceeding our operational capacity,” said Dr. Ayuel Lual, Medical Director at Renk Hospital. “We are grateful for the timely support from our partners, particularly WHO, whose interventions have been instrumental in keeping the hospital functional.”The response to recent mass casualty incidents has been bolstered by the collaborative efforts of WHO, MSF-Belgium, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), and the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR). Their support has been crucial in delivering urgent medical and surgical care despite the challenging conditions.Beyond trauma care, the worsening humanitarian crisis has heightened the risk of disease outbreaks. The influx of displaced populations has led to deteriorating sanitation and overcrowding, fueling the spread of infectious diseases, including cholera. The already strained healthcare infrastructure now faces an increased demand for prevention, treatment, and disease surveillance.Dr. Humphrey Karamagi, WHO Representative for South Sudan, underscored the gravity of the situation: “The scale of displacement is staggering, and health needs have risen dramatically. WHO and partners are ramping up the response by delivering essential medical supplies and expanding health services to new border crossings experiencing a surge in arrivals.”Expanding emergency health servicesTo meet the escalating demand for emergency and surgical care, WHO has deployed additional makeshift tents, increasing bed capacity by 60. This expansion aims to ensure that more patients receive lifesaving treatment without delay.With funding from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the EU Civil Protection & Humanitarian Aid (ECHO), WHO has distributed 12.5 metric tons of emergency health kits. These kits include Interagency Emergency Health kits, kits for emergency surgery and trauma management, cholera kits, and other vital lifesaving medicines. This distribution has benefited around 123,000 individuals affected by conflict and the host community.Call for sustained humanitarian supportAs the crisis deepens, continued humanitarian assistance is critical. The collaborative efforts of WHO and its partners highlight the urgent need for sustained funding and resources to support the growing healthcare demands in Renk. Strengthened coordination and long-term investment in health services are essential to alleviating suffering and ensuring that both displaced populations and host communities receive the care they desperately need. \n",

      "27 February 2025\n",

      "Kinshasa – Health authorities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and experts from World Health Organization (WHO) are carrying out further investigations to determine the cause of another cluster of illness and community deaths in Equateur province. In recent months, disease surveillance has identified increases in illness and deaths three times in different areas of the country, and triggered follow-up investigations to confirm the cause and provide needed support.  Since the beginning of 2025, a series of illnesses and community deaths have affected Equateur province. The most recent cluster occurred in the Basankusu health zone, where last week 141 additional people fell ill, with no deaths reported. In the same health zone, 158 cases and 58 deaths were reported in the same health zone earlier in February. In January, Bolamba health zone reported 12 people who fell ill including 8 deaths. Increased disease surveillance has identified in total of 1096 sick people and 60 deaths in Basankusu and Bolomba fitting a broad case definition that includes fever, headache, chills, sweating, stiff neck, muscle aches, multiple joint pain and body aches, a runny or bleeding from nose, cough, vomiting and diarrhoea.  The Democratic Republic of the Congo is facing many concurrent crises and outbreaks, putting a further strain on the health sector and the population. In response to the latest cluster of illness, a national rapid response team from Kinshasa and Equateur including WHO health emergency experts was deployed to Basankusu and Bolomba health zones to investigate the situation and determine if there is an unusual pattern. The experts are stepping up disease surveillance, conducting interviews with community members to understand the background, and providing treatment for diseases such as malaria, typhoid fever and meningitis.  WHO has delivered emergency medical supplies, including testing kits, and developed detailed protocols to enhance disease investigation. Initial laboratory analysis has turned out negative for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus disease. Around half of the samples tested positive for malaria, which is common in the region. Further tests are to be carried out for meningitis. Food, water and environmental samples will also be analysed, to determine if there might be contamination. The various samples will be sent for further testing at the national reference laboratory in Kinshasa. Earlier samples turned out not to be viable and re-testing was undertaken.  Basankusu and Bolomba are about 180 kilometres apart and more than 300 kilometres from the provincial capital Mbandaka. The two localities are reachable by road or via the Congo River from Mbandaka. This remoteness limits access to health care, including testing and treatment. Poor road and telecommunication infrastructure are also major challenges. WHO is supporting the local health authorities reinforce investigation and response measures, with more than 80 community health workers trained to detect and report cases and deaths.   Further efforts are needed to reinforce testing, early case detection and reporting, for the current event but also for future incidents. WHO remains on the ground supporting health worker, collaborating closely with zonal, provincial and national health authorities to provide lifesaving medical supplies and to coordinate response to curb the spread of the illness and other outbreaks in the region. \n",

      "Luanda – One morning in late January 2025, Julia Armando found her 68-year-old mother collapsed on the floor, suffering from severe diarrhoea and vomiting. “It’s a situation I’ve never seen before… it was a shock to see my mother lying on the floor without strength,” she says. Armando rushed her mother to the nearest cholera treatment centre, where she was treated and thankfully made a full recovery.After her firsthand experience of the severity of cholera as Angola battles an outbreak of the disease, Armando, from the north-western Bengo province and one of the most affected by the outbreak, has become an advocate in her community. She spreads awareness of cholera symptoms and the need to report to a health facility immediately if symptoms are detected. “We need to control this dangerous disease. We can’t live well while it persists,” she says.Julia’s experience has become more common in the three most affected provinces, namely Luanda, Bengo and Icolo e Bengo, since the cholera outbreak was confirmed in Angola on 7 January 2025.Given the increased risk associated with onset of the rainy season, the health authorities in Angola, with support from World Health Organization (WHO) and partners, are intensifying control measures to halt the spread of the disease and end the outbreak. This includes the deployment of 20 rapid response teams in three provinces, namely Luanda, Bengo and Icolo e Bengo, to conduct active case finding in communities and strengthen the community resilience.WHO has trained more than 120 health workers in active case finding and reporting, performing rapid infection surveys, processing data and mobilizing communities to adopt preventive measures. In Bengo province, the health authorities, with WHO’s support, have established 13 rapid response teams working daily in communities.“WHO is supporting the government in reinforcing response teams in the communities, ensuring timely identification of affected individuals, mobilizing the community, controlling infections, and protecting the Angolan population,” says Dr Lelo Zola, WHO Emergency Officer.In addition to active case finding, the Ministry of Health, with support from the WHO, UNICEF, the World Bank, and the International Committee of the Red Cross, conducted a reactive five-day vaccination campaign in January 2025, vaccinating more than 900 000 people. Thanks to strong community engagement and advocacy efforts, the campaign achieved a 99.5% vaccination coverage rate.“We are all committed to ending cholera and are grateful for WHO’s support. With active cholera case finding in the community, combined with community mobilization, use of safe water, good hygiene, adequate surveillance, prompt case management and vaccination, we expect to see a reduction in cases,” says Bengo provincial health director, Domingos Golão.Since the outbreak was confirmed, around 5000 suspected cases including 800 confirmed have been reported, with 180 deaths and a 3.6% case fatality rate (CFR). While WHO’s recommendation is that CFR should not exceed 1%, it has reduced from 9% at its peak in the second week of January 2025. As more cases are identified through active search and appropriately treated, fewer deaths are recorded.“We must all work together ‒ government, national and international organizations, and the private sector ‒ to ensure access to treated water, timely treatment, and preventive measures, especially in the most critical and hard-to-reach areas. It is our joint responsibility to prevent further loss of life from this preventable and treatable disease,” says Dr Zabulon Yoti, WHO Representative in Angola. \n",

      "Abuja, 27 February, 2025 - The World Health Organization (WHO) has reaffirmed its commitment to supporting Nigeria's government in strengthening Primary Health Care (PHC) and addressing health system issues by implementing innovative initiatives. This commitment aligns with the country's goal to eliminate all types of polioviruses by the end of 2025.WHO Country Representative in Nigeria, Dr Walter Kazadi Mulombo, said at the recently concluded First Quarter Review Meeting of the Northern Traditional Leaders Committee (NTLC) on PHC Delivery in Abuja.Earlier in his opening remark, the Coordinating Minister of Health and Social Welfare, Professor Muhammad Pate, had appreciated the council's tenacity in mobilizing their communities and overseeing polio vaccination campaigns towards eradication of the disease in the country. An urgent clarion callProfessor Pate urged the traditional leaders not to rest on their oars. He emphasized the urgent need to eliminate the circulating variant poliovirus type 2 (cVPV2) transmission in the country by December 2025.Professor Pate called on the traditional leaders to double their efforts by leveraging their influence to strengthen community trust and participation in immunization efforts.\"This council has remained the most steadfast primary healthcare structure in Nigeria, Africa, and possibly the world. For 16 consecutive years, you have convened quarterly meetings without fail. Delivering his goodwill message, Dr Mulombo also set the tone with a call to action, lauding the Nigerian government's and traditional leaders' unwavering commitment and underscoring their critical role in championing the fight against polio in Nigeria. \"While 2024 has been a challenging year for Nigeria's polio program, we have the opportunity to turn things around, and now is the best time to act urgently and decisively to end cVPV2 in the country. WHO is committed to supporting Nigeria in addressing the challenges, even in the face of geopolitical complexities\", said Dr Mulombo.The Country Representative also pledged WHO's support in fast-tracking the accreditation of the Ibadan polio laboratory while announcing that the laboratory is fully accredited to conduct polio sequencing.The polio laboratory in Ibadan, established in 1993, is one of the iconic polio laboratories in Nigeria that can detect, identify, and promptly report wild polioviruses (WPV), cVPVD2, as well as other enteroviruses that may be present in clinical and environmental specimens.Tackling Challenges with Renewed CommitmentDespite the progress made, Nigeria is still reporting cases of cVPVD2. Dr Muyi Aina, Executive Director of the National Primary Healthcare Development Agency (NPHCDA),  pointed out some of the challenges deterring the nation from achieving its polio eradication goal said, \"For too long, we have struggled with issues like noncompliance, vaccine hesitancy, missed children, security concerns, inadequate routine immunization coverage, data falsification and malnutrition. We need to push beyond our limitations and ensure that no child is left unvaccinated. We need the support of the NTLC members, as community engagement is key to achieving success. We must rewrite the story this year,\" said Dr Muyi.Traditional Leaders Vow to Strengthen EffortsIn his remark, Alhaji Sama'ila Muhammad Mera, the Emir of Argungu, who double as the NTLC chair, expressed gratitude to the government and partners for their continued support. The Emir called on his fellow traditional leaders to collaborate with religious figures and community influencers to drive vaccination demand.Raising concerns over the suboptimal performance of routine immunization in the country's North Central and North West geopolitical regions in 2024, he said, \"The time has come for us to end polio once and for all. Every unvaccinated child is a risk to all children in our communities. We must strengthen newborn and defaulter tracking systems to ensure every child receives the necessary vaccines. We must play an active role in planning and supervising immunization sessions,\" the Emir urged.The Emir welcomed the strategic shifts introduced by the government, including increased accountability, localized advocacy, improved data integration, and synchronized campaign efforts. A Unified Effort to End PolioThe NTLC's quarterly meetings serve as a vital platform for reviewing progress and tackling challenges in polio eradication, routine immunization, maternal and child health, and primary healthcare service delivery.The latest gathering featured presentations on the state of Nigeria's polio program, updates on routine immunization, maternal and newborn health, and the introduction of the rubella vaccine. Participants also discussed previous meeting resolutions, with various partners delivering goodwill messages.\n",

      "27 February 2025\n",
      "\n",
      "Kampala/Uganda: The Uganda Ministry of Health (MOH), with support from the World Health Organization (WHO) and partners deployed the national Emergency Medical Team (nEMT) to the ongoing Sudan Virus Disease (SVD) response. On 30 January 2025, MOH declared an outbreak of SVD in the country after a 35-year-old Ugandan male who worked as a nurse in Mulago National Referral Hospital tested positive for the virus following his death on 29 January 2025. Before his diagnosis, he sought treatment at multiple health facilities, including Mulago Referral Hospital in Kampala, Saidina Abubakar Islamic Hospital in Matugga in Wakiso District, and Mbale Regional Referral Hospital in Mbale City.By 2 February 2025, Uganda had recorded a total of nine confirmed cases. This includes the index case and eight additional confirmed cases from three different districts. This brings the total to nine cases (one mortality and eight recoveries).  In response, the Ministry of Health swiftly deployed the national Emergency Medical Team to support case management. A total of 44 national Emergency Medical Team members of various cadres were deployed. A team of 26 was deployed to support the operationalization of Mulago National Referral Hospital, while 18 were deployed to Mbale district Ebola treatment unit. This marked the first time that the country has deployed the national EMT for an Ebola response. At Mulago hospital, the nEMT members were on ground within two hours of deployment, immediately  setting up the isolation unit and preparing to receive patients. Their support included providing direct clinical care according to national Ebola case management guidelines, strengthening referral systems to evacuate new cases from the community promptly, and building capacity of the local teams through training and mentorship. In Mbale, the team was deployed on Monday 3 February 2025 to strengthen the isolation unit set-up and support clinical care. The Mbale team consisted of 18 members including physicians, nurses, a logistician, Infection Prevention and Control officer, plus a safe and dignified burial team. “In previous outbreaks, we relied on mobilization of health workers across the country, working alongside surge teams from outside the country. However, this time, we had a fully trained, readily deployable trained team who were on-site within two hours of deployment and fully constituted within 12 hours. As a country, this is a proud moment for us,” said Dr Rony Bahatungire, Ag. Commissioner - Clinical Services and national EMT focal person. Beyond clinical care, the nEMT has played a critical role in providing mental health and psycho-social services to health workers, patients and their communities including affected schools. Mentorship and training were extended to existing health workers within the local systems, to ensure sustainable support to survivors’ resettlement.  Sudan Virus Disease outbreaks have reported a mortality rate between 41% to 70% in previous outbreaks. The last outbreak in the country recorded a mortality rate of 47%. However, the EVD mortality rate during this response has been 11.1%, and this was the index case. The response has recorded a 100% survival rate for all patients admitted to the isolation units. This is due to multiple reasons including the rapid deployment of an experienced EMT that has maintained the high standard of care.Since their deployment on 30 January 2025, the team has maintained 24-hour coverage, providing optimized clinical care. This included early supportive care across the spectrum from mild cases to provision of critical care. They have managed a total of eight confirmed cases and numerous suspects. To date, no mortality has been reported in either of the isolation units, despite managing some severe and critical cases including children. “Public health emergencies can quickly overwhelm the local health systems, necessitating additional support. Fortunately, the national EMTs understand the local context and are readily deployable to support affected communities,” said Dr Kasonde Mwinga, the WHO Representative to Uganda.Uganda currently has 149 nEMT members, ready to respond to public health emergencies.  The nEMT concept dates to December 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic. At the time, MOH, with support from WHO, hosted the first regional training for nEMT members to support the COVID-19 response. MOH continued to build the team through additional trainings and drills supported by WHO with funding from partners like the European Union Humanitarian Aid Agency (DG ECHO), the Robert Koch Institute and Malteser International among others. The nEMT has also previously deployed for Mpox and measles outbreaks within the country. In July 2024, Uganda’s Ministry of Health approved the nEMT roadmap to guide future emergency response efforts. This aligns with the WHO global EMT initiative, which aims to improve the speed and quality of emergency medical response while strengthening national health systems.“The work that we do is not only about responding to outbreaks. Preparedness is an important part of our work. The Uganda national EMTs program has shown the importance of preparedness and its impact on response.” Dr Michael Ryan, Deputy Director General and Head - World Health Emergencies, WHO Headquarters, Geneva.   \n",

      "Lomé – Renforcer la préparation aux urgences de santé publique à travers une meilleure surveillance épidémiologique, des systèmes de laboratoires améliorés et le développement des ressources humaines en santé, c’est le but visé par le projet du Fonds de lutte contre les pandémies qui est mis en œuvre au Togo. Dans cet article, le Dr Amadou Baïlo Diallo, représentant par intérim de l’Organisation mondiale de la Santé (OMS) au Togo, revient sur cette initiative, soutenue par l’OMS,sous la direction du gouvernement et en partenariat avec la FAO et l’UNICEF, l’OIM et la Croix Rouge togolaise.Le Dr Diallo souligne l’exploit du Togo, qui fait partie des cinq pays africains sélectionnés parmi 179 candidatures mondiales pour bénéficier de ce fonds. Il met en avant l’importance de la collaboration multisectorielle, notamment grâce à l’approche « Une seule santé », pour répondre efficacement aux risques épidémiques et aux urgences de santé publique. En perspective, le Dr Diallo énonce les priorités et les enseignements tirés pour renforcer les capacités nationales de réponse aux crises sanitaires au Togo sur les trois prochaines années.  Pouvez-vous nous parler du projet Fonds de lutte contre les pandémies (Pandemic Fund) au Togo ?J'ai une bonne connaissance de l’initiative du Fonds de lutte contre les pandémies pour avoir coordonné au niveau du Bureau régional de l’OMS pour l’Afrique notamment au Hub de Dakar (Sénégal) l’élaboration des demandes de financement pour les pays de l’Afrique de l’Ouest et du Centre à soumettre au Fonds pandémique pour les rounds 1 et 2 respectivement en 2023 et 2024. Le projet de renforcement de la préparation et la réponse aux urgences sanitaires au Togo, financé par le Fonds pandémique est une innovation dans la mobilisation des ressources financières pour soutenir les pays à revenu intermédiaire dont le Togo dans la lutte contre les maladies à potentiel épidémique. Au Togo comme dans les autres pays soutenus par le Fonds pandémique, trois domaines d’intervention sont prioritaires. Il s’agit de la surveillance épidémiologique et l’alerte précoce, des ressources humaines et le système de laboratoire. Le Togo fait partie des cinq (05) pays africains dont la proposition a été retenue sur les 179 demandes soumises au Conseil de direction du Fonds. La mise en œuvre de ce projet au Togo est une concrétisation de l’opérationnalisation de la plateforme nationale « Une seule santé », « One Health » en anglais, plateforme multisectorielle dans laquelle travaillent ensemble les Ministère de la santé, de l’agriculture et de l’élevage, de l’environnement pour renforcer les capacités de préparation et de réponse du pays face aux urgences de santé publique.  Les partenaires de ce projet au Togo sont le gouvernement togolais, représenté par les Ministères respectivement en charge de la santé, de l’agriculture et de l’élevage, et de l’environnement, l’OMS, la FAO et l’UNICEF. Le projet de lutte contre les pandémies au Togo vise trois objectifs. Il s’agit de renforcer le système de détection, d’alerte précoce et de riposte contre les épidémies et pandémies. A cela s’ajoute l’amélioration de la fonctionnalité et de la qualité du réseau national de laboratoires pour le diagnostic des maladies à potentiel épidémique. Et enfin, le pays est appelé à renforcer les capacités en ressources humaines en santé humaine, animale et environnementale pour la préparation aux urgences.La mise en œuvre du projet est entamée depuis le mois d’octobre 2023 à travers l’allocation des ressources aux partenaires, la mise en place d’une équipe de coordination technique du projet qui réunit les experts des trois Ministères clés et les agences d’exécution, l’élaboration d’un plan de suivi et évaluation, l’élaboration et la mise en œuvre des plans d’action trimestriels. Le premier rapport technique annuel a été élaboré et soumis au Fonds pandémique au mois de juin 2024 avec un taux d’exécution financière de 33 %.  Pour les trois prochaines années, quelles améliorations voudriez-vous voir dans la prévention des pandémies, leurs préparations et la capacité de réponse nationale au Togo ?D’une manière générale, je suis persuadé qu’aux termes de ce projet au Togo, avec les efforts combinés en cours aussi bien au niveau des acteurs nationaux que des partenaires, les capacités essentielles du Règlement sanitaire international (RSI 2005) seraient renforcées dans les domaines de la prévention, la détection et la réponse face aux urgences de santé publique. De manière spécifique pour les trois prochaines années, nous espérons que les résultats probants seront obtenus à savoir : le renforcement des capacités de détection des épidémies à travers les activités de surveillance épidémiologique et d’alerte précoce et le renforcement des capacités du personnel de santé humaine, animale et environnementale pour une meilleure préparation et réponse aux urgences de santé publique. Autres résultats : le renforcement du système national de laboratoire pour une confirmation rapide des épidémies ainsi que le développement de l’approche multisectorielle pour la préparation et la réponse, sans oublier la réduction de la morbidité et la mortalité liées aux maladies à potentiel épidémique au Togo.   Quels sont les éléments nécessaires à la réussite d'un projet du Fonds pandémique au Togo ?Les facteurs de succès du projet de Fonds pandémique au Togo sont de trois niveaux. D’abord, c’est la volonté politique manifeste du gouvernement togolais à développer et mettre en œuvre une politique nationale de santé soutenue par l’élaboration et la mise en œuvre d’un Plan national de développement sanitaire (PNDS) lequel intègre la mobilisation des ressources additionnelles auprès des partenaires pour les programmes prioritaires dont la préparation et la réponse aux urgences de santé publique. Ensuite, vient l’adhésion du gouvernement togolais aux initiatives mondiales en faveur de la santé publique mondiale et le développement tels que le Règlement sanitaire international (RSI 2005), l’initiative « Une seule santé » ou « One Health », les objectifs de développement durable (ODD). Et enfin, nous saluons la disponibilité des partenaires techniques et financiers (PTF) à harmoniser leurs efforts pour travailler ensemble tout en s’alignant aux priorités du gouvernement togolais pour une meilleure efficacité de l’aide au développement. Dans le cas de ce projet, un partenariat fort est en train d’être concrétisé entre l’OMS, l’UNICEF et la FAO qui sont les agences d’exécution. L’OIM et la Croix rouge togolaise en sont des contractants avec l’OMS dans l’exécution des volets spécifiques du projet entrant dans leurs domaines de compétence.  Quel rôle joue l’augmentation des investissements dans le renforcement des capacités nationales en prévention des pandémies, leur préparation et la capacité de réponse au Togo ?L’obtention de ce financement du Fonds pandémique est un véritable succès pour le gouvernement togolais et de ses partenaires mais aussi une opportunité de renforcement des capacités nationales de préparation et de réponse aux urgences d’une part, une source additionnelle de ressources pour le renforcement du système national de santé du Togo d’autre part.  Quels sont les enseignements tirés des épidémies passées au Togo qui pourraient être appliqués dans la mise en œuvre du projet du Fonds de lutte contre la pandémie au Togo (en particulier dans les domaines de la surveillance, des laboratoire et du personnel de santé) ?Ils sont nombreux. On peut citer la mise en œuvre de la stratégie régionale de surveillance intégrée de la maladie et la riposte (SIMR), les plans de contingence de lutte contre les maladies à potentiel épidémique telles que la méningite, la fièvre jaune, la fièvre de la Lassa, la rougeole, le choléra et la pandémie de la Covid-19 ainsi que les leçons tirées par la documentation de la gestion de ces urgences à travers les revues- après actions (RAA).Nous pouvons également citer le renforcement régulier des capacités essentielles du (RSI 2005) et l’utilisation des résultats des différentes évaluations des risques y compris l’évaluation externe conjointe du RSI 2005 qui pourraient être bénéfiques aux trois domaines prioritaires du Fonds pandémique que sont la surveillance, le système de laboratoires et le personnel de santé. Votre mot de fin ?Je voudrais lancer un appel aux acteurs et aux partenaires du système de santé togolais de poursuivre leurs efforts communs pour le renforcement des capacités nationales de préparation et de réponse aux urgences de santé publique. Nous devons davantage travailler ensemble sur la préparation aux urgences car par expérience, je peux rassurer qu’une préparation aussi petite qu’elle soit est bénéfique pour une réponse efficace face à une urgence.En somme, le Fonds pandémique est une initiative de financement de la préparation aux épidémies/pandémies mis à la disposition des pays à revenu faible et intermédiaire dont la mise en œuvre contribuerait au renforcement des capacités essentielles du (RSI 2005). Le Togo et les partenaires techniques et financiers en santé ne ménageront aucun effort pour permettre au premier round de ce projet d’atteindre ses résultats tout en espérant que le deuxième sera obtenu aussitôt afin de soutenir les efforts du pays dans la gestion efficace de l’impact de la crise du Sahel central dans le développement socio-sanitaire de la région des Savanes. L’obtention des financements dans le cadre du 2è cycle de financement du Fonds pandémique (Pandemic Fund) permettrait également la prise en compte des déterminants environnementaux des épidémies et la lutte contre les changements climatiques.  A propos du Dr DialloLe Dr Amadou Baïlo Diallo est un médecin épidémiologiste qui a plus de 30 ans d'expérience. Le Dr Diallo possède une connaissance approfondie des pays en développement, en particulier de l'Afrique. Il travaille pour l'Organisation mondiale de la Santé (OMS) depuis 2004 et il occupe actuellement le poste de représentant par intérim de l'OMS au Togo. Avant de rejoindre l’OMS, le Dr Diallo a respectivement travaillé pour le Ministère guinéen de la santé publique, le centre national de lutte contre le paludisme de Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso) et le centre international de coopération en santé et développement (Canada). A ces titres, le Dr Diallo a contribué au développement des systèmes de santé dans les pays en développement, notamment dans la lutte contre les maladies tropicales, la gestion et l'évaluation des programmes de santé publique, la formation du personnel de santé et la lutte contre les pandémies/épidémies (COVID-19, Ebola, Marburg, choléra, fièvre de la Vallée du Rift etc.). Le Dr Diallo est expérimenté dans la fourniture de l’appui technique pour l'élaboration de politiques et de stratégies de lutte contre les maladies transmissibles, de programmes de formation, de dialogue politique et de plaidoyer, y compris la recherche sur les programmes prioritaires de santé publique avec plus de 150 missions de soutien technique et de développement de partenariats dans plus de 30 pays d'Afrique, d'Europe et des Amériques.\n",

      "Estimated 1.2 million adolescents died in 2015, over 3000 every day, mostly from preventable or treatable causes.\n",
      "Road traffic injuries were the leading cause of death in 2015. Other major causes of adolescent deaths include lower respiratory infections, suicide, diarrhoeal diseases, and drowning.\n",
      "Globally, there are 44 births per 1000 to girls aged 15 to 19 per year.\n",
      "Half of all mental health disorders in adulthood start by age 14, but most cases are undetected and untreated.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Around 1.2 billion people, or 1 in 6 of the world’s population, are adolescents aged 10 to 19.\n",
      "Most are healthy, but there is still substantial premature death, illness, and injury among adolescents. Illnesses can hinder their ability to grow and develop to their full potential. Alcohol or tobacco use, lack of physical activity, unprotected sex and/or exposure to violence can jeopardize not only their current health, but also their health as adults, and even the health of their future children.\n",
      "Promoting healthy behaviours during adolescence, and taking steps to better protect young people from health risks are critical for the prevention of health problems in adulthood, and for countries’ future health and ability to develop and thrive.\n",

      "              \n",
      "\n",
      "Main health issues include:Early pregnancy and childbirthThe leading cause of death for 15– 19-year-old girls globally is complications from pregnancy and childbirth.Some 11% of all births worldwide are to girls aged 15–19 years, and the vast majority of these births are in low- and middle-income countries. The UN Population Division puts the global adolescent birth rate in 2015 at 44 births per 1000 girls this age – country rates range from 1 to over 200 births per 1000 girls (1). This indicates a marked decrease since 1990. This decrease is reflected in a similar decline in maternal mortality rates among 15–19 year olds.One of the specific targets of the health Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 3) is that by 2030, the world should ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health-care services, including for family planning, information and education, and the integration of reproductive health into national strategies and programmes. To support this, a proposed indicator for the Global strategy for women’s, children’s and adolescents’ health is the adolescent birth rate.Better access to contraceptive information and services can reduce the number of girls becoming pregnant and giving birth at too young an age. Laws that specify a minimum age of marriage at 18 and which are enforced can help.Girls who do become pregnant need access to quality antenatal care. Where permitted by law, adolescents who opt to terminate their pregnancies should have access to safe abortion.HIVMore than 2 million adolescents are living with HIV. Although the overall number of HIV-related deaths is down 30% since the peak in 2006 estimates suggest that HIV deaths among adolescents are rising. This increase, which has been predominantly in the WHO African Region, may reflect the fact that although more children with HIV survive into adolescence, they do not all then get the care and support they need to remain in good health and prevent transmission. In sub-Saharan Africa only 10% of young men and 15% of young women aged 15 to 24 are aware of their HIV status.One of the specific targets of the health Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 3) is that by 2030 there should be an end to the epidemics of AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and neglected tropical diseases, hepatitis, water-borne diseases and other communicable diseases. Given the high prevalence of HIV in many countries, to achieve this, adolescents will need to be central to control efforts.Young people need to know how to protect themselves and must have the means to do so. This includes being able to obtain condoms to prevent sexual transmission of the virus and clean needles and syringes for those who inject drugs. Better access to HIV testing and counselling, and stronger subsequent links to HIV treatment services for those who test HIV positive, are also needed.Other infectious diseasesThanks to improved childhood vaccination, adolescent deaths and disability from measles have fallen markedly – for example, by 90% in the African Region between 2000 and 2012. Diarrhoea and lower respiratory tract infections are estimated to be among the top 5 causes of death for 10–19 year olds. These two diseases, together with meningitis, are the top three causes of adolescent death in African low and middle-income countries (LMICs).Mental healthDepression is the third leading cause of illness and disability among adolescents, and suicide is the third leading cause of death in older adolescents (15–19 years). Violence, poverty, humiliation and feeling devalued can increase the risk of developing mental health problems.Building life skills in children and adolescents and providing them with psychosocial support in schools and other community settings can help promote good mental health. Programmes to help strengthen the ties between adolescents and their families are also important. If problems arise, they should be detected and managed by competent and caring health workers.ViolenceViolence is a leading cause of death in older adolescent males. Interpersonal violence represents 43% of all adolescent male deaths in LMICs in the WHO Americas Region. Globally, 1 in 10 girls under the age of 20 years report experiencing sexual violence.Promoting nurturing relationships between parents and children early in life, providing training in life skills, and reducing access to alcohol and firearms can help to prevent injuries and deaths due to violence. Effective and empathetic care for adolescent survivors of violence and ongoing support can help deal with the physical and psychological consequences.Alcohol and drugsHarmful drinking among adolescents is a major concern in many countries. It reduces self-control and increases risky behaviours, such as unsafe sex or dangerous driving. It is a primary cause of injuries (including those due to road traffic accidents), violence (especially by a partner) and premature deaths. It can also lead to health problems in later life and affect life expectancy. Setting a minimum age for buying and consuming alcohol and regulating how alcoholic drinks are targeted at the younger market are among the strategies for reducing harmful drinking.Drug use among 15–19 year olds is also an important global concern. Drug control may focus on reducing drug demand, drug supply, or both, and successful programmes usually include structural, community, and individual-level interventions.InjuriesUnintentional injuries are the leading cause of death and disability among adolescents. In 2015, over 115 000 adolescents died as a result of road traffic accidents. Young drivers need advice on driving safely, while laws that prohibit driving under the influence of alcohol and drugs need to be strictly enforced. Blood alcohol levels need to be set lower for teenage drivers. Graduated licences for novice drivers with zero-tolerance for drink-driving are recommended.Drowning is also a major cause of death among adolescents – 57 000 adolescents, two-thirds of them boys, are estimated to have drowned in 2015, and teaching children and adolescents to swim is an essential intervention to prevent these deaths.Malnutrition and obesityMany boys and girls in developing countries enter adolescence undernourished, making them more vulnerable to disease and early death. At the other end of the spectrum, the number of adolescents who are overweight or obese is increasing in low, middle and high-income countries.Exercise and nutritionIron deficiency anaemia is the leading cause of years lost to death and disability in 2015. Iron and folic acid supplements are a solution that also helps to promote health before adolescents become parents. Regular deworming in areas where intestinal helminths such as hookworm are common is recommended to prevent micronutrient (including iron) deficiencies.Developing healthy eating and exercise habits in adolescence are foundations for good health in adulthood. Reducing the marketing of foods high in saturated fats, trans-fatty acids, free sugars, or salt and providing access to healthy foods and opportunities to engage in physical activity are important for all but especially children and adolescents. Yet available survey data indicate that fewer than 1 in every 4 adolescents meets the recommended guidelines for physical activity: 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity daily.Tobacco useThe vast majority of people using tobacco today began doing so when they were adolescents. Prohibiting the sale of tobacco products to minors and increasing the price of tobacco products through higher taxes, banning tobacco advertising and ensuring smoke-free environments are crucial. Globally, at least 1 in 10 adolescents aged 13 to 15 years uses tobacco, although there are areas where this figure is much higher. Cigarette smoking seems to be decreasing among younger adolescents in some high-income countries.Rights of adolescentsThe rights of children (people under 18 years of age) to survive, grow and develop are enshrined in international legal documents. In 2013, the Committee on the Rights of the Child (CRC), which oversees the child rights convention, published guidelines on the right of children and adolescents to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health, and a General Comment on realizing the rights of children during adolescence was published in 2016. It highlights states’ obligations to recognise the special health and development needs and rights of adolescents and young people.The Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) also sets out the rights of women and girls to health and adequate health care.\n",

      "In May 2017, WHO published a major report: Global Accelerated Action for the Health of Adolescents (AA-HA!): Guidance to support country implementation. The AA-HA! Guidance has drawn on inputs received during extensive consultations with Member States, United Nations agencies, adolescents and young people, civil society and other partners. It aims to assist governments in deciding what they plan to do and how they plan to do it as they respond to the health needs of adolescents in their countries. This reference document targets national-level policy-makers and programme managers to assist them in planning, implementing , monitoring and evaluation of adolescent health programmes.Overall, WHO carries out a range of functions to improve the health of young people, including:production of evidence-based guidelines to support health services and other sectors;making recommendations to governments on adolescent health and the provision of high quality, age-appropriate health services for adolescents;documenting progress in adolescent health and development; andraising awareness of health issues for young people among the general public and other interested stakeholders.\n",

      "Key factsAbout 16 million girls aged 15 to 19 and some 1 million girls under 15 give birth every year—most in low- and middle-income countries.Complications during pregnancy and childbirth are the second cause of death for 15-19 year-old girls globally.Every year, some 3 million girls aged 15 to 19 undergo unsafe abortions.Babies born to adolescent mothers face a substantially higher risk of dying than those born to women aged 20 to 24.Health EffectsAdolescent pregnancies are a global problem that occurs in high, middle, and low income countries. Around the world, adolescent pregnancies are more likely to occur in marginalized communities, commonly driven by poverty and lack of education and employment opportunities (2).For some adolescents, pregnancy and childbirth are planned and wanted. In some contexts, girls may face social pressure to marry and, once married, to have children. Each year, about 15 million girls are married before the age of 18 years, and 90% of births to girls aged 15 to 19 years occur within marriage (2), (10).For many adolescents, pregnancy and childbirth are neither planned nor wanted. Twenty-three million girls aged 15 to 19 years in developing regions have an unmet need for modern contraception (1). As a result, half of pregnancies among girls aged 15 to 19 years in developing regions are estimated to be unintended (1).Adolescents face barriers to accessing contraception including restrictive laws and policies regarding provision of contraceptive based on age or marital status, health worker bias and/or lack of willingness to acknowledge adolescents’ sexual health needs, and adolescents’ own inability to access contraceptives because of knowledge, transportation, and financial constraints. Additionally, adolescents face barriers that prevent use and/or consistent and correct use of contraception, even when adolescents are able to obtain contraceptives: pressure to have children; stigma surrounding non-marital sexual activity and/or contraceptive use; fear of side effects; lack of knowledge on correct use; and factors contributing to discontinuation (for example, hesitation to go back and seek contraceptives because of negative first experiences with health workers and health systems, changing reproductive needs, changing reproductive intentions).In some situations, adolescent girls may be unable to refuse unwanted sex or resist coerced sex, which tends to be unprotected. Sexual violence is widespread and particularly affects adolescent girls: about 20% of girls around the world experience sexual abuse as children and adolescents (11). Inequitable gender norms and social norms that condone violence against women put girls at greater risk of unintended pregnancy.WHO responseWHO published guidelines in 2011 with the UN Population Fund (UNFPA) on preventing early pregnancies and reducing poor reproductive outcomes. These made recommendations for action that countries could take, with 6 main objectives:reducing marriage before the age of 18;creating understanding and support to reduce pregnancy before the age of 20;increasing the use of contraception by adolescents at risk of unintended pregnancy;reducing coerced sex among adolescents;reducing unsafe abortion among adolescents;increasing use of skilled antenatal, childbirth and postnatal care among adolescents.WHO is also involved in a variety of joint efforts with related agencies and programmes, such as the “H4+” initiative that includes UNAIDS, UNFPA, UNICEF, UN Women and the World Bank. The H4+ aims to to accelerate progress towards achieving Millennium Development Goals 4 (reducing child mortality) and 5 (improving maternal health) by 2015. It tackles the root causes of maternal, newborn and child mortality and morbidity—among them gender inequality, child marriage and limited access to education for girls. H4+ aligns closely with national health plans and provides some financial and technical support to governments.\n",

      "Globally, falls are a major public health problem. An estimated 424 000 fatal falls occur each year, making it the second leading cause of unintentional injury death, after road traffic injuries. Over 80% of fall-related fatalities occur in low- and middle-income countries, with regions of the Western Pacific and South East Asia accounting for more than two thirds of these deaths. In all regions of the world, death rates are highest among adults over the age of 60 years.Though not fatal, approximately 37.3 million falls are severe enough to require medical attention occur each year. Such falls are responsible for over 17 million DALYs (disability-adjusted life years) lost2. The largest morbidity occurs in people aged 65 years or older, young adults aged 15–29 years and children aged 15 years or younger.While nearly 40% of the total DALYs lost due to falls worldwide occurs in children, this measurement may not accurately reflect the impact of fall-related disabilities for older individuals who have fewer life years to lose. In addition, those individuals who fall and suffer a disability, particularly older people, are at a major risk for subsequent long-term care and institutionalization.The financial costs from fall-related injuries are substantial. For people aged 65 years or older, the average health system cost per fall injury in the Republic of Finland and Australia are US$ 3611 and US$ 1049 respectively. Evidence from Canada suggests the implementation of effective prevention strategies with a subsequent 20% reduction in the incidence of falls among children under 10 could create a net savings of over US$ 120 million each year.\n",

For example, in the United States of America, 20–30% of older people who fall suffer moderate to severe injuries such as bruises, hip fractures, or head traumas. This risk level may be in part due to physical, sensory, and cognitive changes associated with ageing, in combination with environments that are not adapted for an aging population.Another high risk group is children. Childhood falls occur largely as a result of their evolving developmental stages, innate curiosity of their surroundings, and increasing levels of independence that coincide with more challenging behaviors commonly referred to as ‘risk taking’. While inadequate adult supervision is a commonly cited risk factor, the circumstances are often complex, interacting with poverty, sole parenthood, and particularly hazardous environments.\n",

Older women and younger children are especially prone to falls and increased injury severity. Worldwide, males consistently sustain higher death rates and DALYs lost. Possible explanations of the greater burden seen among males may include higher levels of risk-taking behaviours and hazards within occupations.Other risk factors include:occupations at elevated heights or other hazardous working conditions;alcohol or substance use;socioeconomic factors including poverty, overcrowded housing, sole parenthood, young maternal age;underlying medical conditions, such as neurological, cardiac or other disabling conditions;side effects of medication, physical inactivity and loss of balance, particularly among older people;poor mobility, cognition, and vision, particularly among those living in an institution, such as a nursing home or chronic care facility;unsafe environments, particularly for those with poor balance and limited vision.\n",

They should prioritize research and public health initiatives to further define the burden, explore variable risk factors and utilize effective prevention strategies. They should support policies that create safer environments and reduce risk factors. They should promote engineering to remove the potential for falls, the training of health care providers on evidence-based prevention strategies; and the education of individuals and communities to build risk awareness.Effective fall prevention programmes aim to reduce the number of people who fall, the rate of falls and the severity of injury should a fall occur. For older individuals, fall prevention programmes can include a number of components to identify and modify risk, such as:screening within living environments for risks for falls;clinical interventions to identify risk factors, such as medication review and modification, treatment of low blood pressure, Vitamin D and calcium supplementation, treatment of correctable visual impairment;home assessment and environmental modification for those with known risk factors or a history of falling;prescription of appropriate assistive devices to address physical and sensory impairments;muscle strengthening and balance retraining prescribed by a trained health professional;community-based group programmes which may incorporate fall prevention education and Tai Chi-type exercises or dynamic balance and strength training;use of hip protectors for those at risk of a hip fracture due to a fall.For children, effective interventions include multifaceted community programmes; engineering modifications of nursery furniture, playground equipment, and other products; and legislation for the use of window guards. Other promising prevention strategies include: use of guard rails/gates, home visitation programmes, mass public education campaigns, and training of individuals and communities in appropriate acute pediatric medical care should a fall occur.1Within the WHO Global Burden of Disease database, fall-related deaths and non-fatal injuries exclude falls due to assault and self-harm; falls from animals, burning buildings, transport vehicles; and falls into fire, water and machinery.2The disability-adjusted life year (DALY) extends the concept of potential years of life lost due to premature death to include equivalent years of “healthy” life lost by virtue of being in states of poor health or disability.\n",

Among these 3.8 million deaths:27% are due to pneumonia18% from stroke27% from ischaemic heart disease20% from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)8% from lung cancer.PneumoniaExposure to household air pollution almost doubles the risk for childhood pneumonia and is responsible for  45% of all pneumonia deaths in children less than 5 years old.   Household air pollution is also risk for acute lower respiratory infections (pneumonia) in adults, and contributes to 28% of all adult deaths to pneumonia.Chronic obstructive pulmonary diseaseOne in four or 25% of premature deaths from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adults in low- and middle-income countries are due to exposure to household air pollution. Women exposed to high levels of indoor smoke are more than two times as likely to suffer from COPD than women who use cleaner fuels and technologies. Among men (who already have a heightened risk of COPD due to their higher rates of smoking), exposure to household air pollution nearly doubles that risk.Stroke12% of all premature deaths due to stroke can be attributed to the daily exposure to household air pollution arising from cooking with solid fuels and kerosene.Ischaemic heart diseaseApproximately 11% of all deaths due to ischaemic heart disease, accounting for over a million premature deaths annually, can be attributed to exposure to household air pollution.Lung cancerApproximately 17% of premature lung cancer deaths in adults are attributable to exposure to carcinogens from household air pollution caused by cooking with kerosene or solid fuels like wood, charcoal or coal. The risk for women is higher, due to their role in food preparation.Other health impacts and risksMore generally, small particulate matter and other pollutants in indoor smoke inflame the airways and lungs, impairing immune response and reducing the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood.There is also evidence of links between household air pollution and low birth weight, tuberculosis, cataract, nasopharyngeal and laryngeal cancers.Mortality from ischaemic heart disease and stroke are also affected by risk factors such as high blood pressure, unhealthy diet, lack of physical activity and smoking. Some other risks for childhood pneumonia include suboptimal breastfeeding, underweight and second-hand smoke. For lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, active smoking and second-hand tobacco smoke are also main risk factors.\n",

In less secure environments, women and children are at risk of injury and violence during fuel gathering.Black carbon (sooty particles) and methane emitted by inefficient stove combustion are powerful climate change pollutants.The lack of access to electricity for at least 1.2 billion people (many of whom then use kerosene lamps for lighting) exposes households to very high levels of fine particulate matter, as well introduces other health risks, e.g. burns, injuries and poisonings from fuel ingestion, constraining other opportunities for health and development, e.g. studying or engaging in small crafts and trades, which require adequate lighting.\n",

WHO is building capacity at the country and regional level to address household air pollution through direct consultations and workshops on household energy and health. This is further complemented by the ongoing development of the Clean Household Energy Solutions Toolkit (CHEST) to support the implementation of  WHO Guidelines for indoor air quality: household fuel combustion. CHEST is a suite of tools and information resources that help countries identify stakeholders working on household energy and/or public health to design, implement and monitor policies addressing household energy.Guidelines for indoor air quality: household fuel combustionTo ensure healthy air in and around the home, WHO’s Guidelines for indoor air quality:  household fuel combustion provide health-based recommendations on the types of fuels and technologies to protect health as well as strategies for the effective dissemination and adoption of such home energy technologies. These build upon existing WHO outdoor air quality guidelines and WHO guidance on levels of specific indoor pollutants.Household energy databaseThe WHO Household energy database is used to monitor global progress in the transition to cleaner fuels and stove combinations in households. It also supports assessments of disease burden from the household air pollution generated from the use of polluting fuel and technologies. Currently the database includes housing data from more than 1100 surveys, representing 157 countries. It has been expanded to include information on household fuels and technologies used for heating and lighting.As the custodial agency for Sustainable Development Goal Indicator 3.9.1 (mortality rate from the joint effects of household and ambient air pollution) and 7.1.2 (population with primary reliance on clean fuels and technologies), WHO uses the Household energy database to derive estimates for tracking progress towards achieving universal clean energy access and related health impacts.Research and programme evaluationWHO is working with countries, researchers and other partners to harmonize methods of evaluation across settings so that health impacts are assessed consistently and rigorously and incorporate economic assessment of health benefits.Leadership and advocacy in the health, energy and climate communityHealth sectorIn May 2015, the World Health Assembly unanimously adopted a resolution on air pollution and health, calling for the integration of health concerns into national, regional and local air pollution-related policies.  The following year, the World Health Assembly adopted a “Roadmap for Enhanced Action,” calling for increased cross-sector cooperation to address the health risks of air pollution.Building on this mandate, WHO is working to integrate guidance and resources for supporting clean household energy into global health initiatives and decision-support tools, such as the Global Action Plan for Pneumonia and Diarrheal Disease (GAPPD), or Global Strategy for Women and Children’s Health, as well as into other aspects of WHO's own health policy guidance. WHO emphasizes the compelling health arguments for cleaner household energy in a range of global forums addressing maternal and child health issues related to pneumonia as well as forums concerned with noncommunicable diseases. This advocacy can help increase awareness of the importance of providing and scaling up of cleaner household energy as a core preventive public health measure.Health and climate changeWHO is a partner of the Climate and Clean Air Coalition to Reduce Short-Lived Climate Pollutants (CCAC). As a member of the CCAC’s health task force, WHO is providing technical support for harnessing health benefits from actions to reduce short-lived climate pollutants, and working to scale up health sector engagement to address such pollutants and improve air quality.Health, energy and sustainable developmentReductions in air pollution-related disease burden (both for household and outdoor) will be used to monitor the progress towards attaining the Sustainable Development Goal on Health (SDG 3).Ensuring universal access to clean fuel and technologies is a target of the Sustainable Development Goal on energy (SDG 7). Achieving this goal could prevent millions of deaths and improve the health and well-being of the billions of people relying on polluting technologies and fuels for cooking, heating and lighting.To better assess the health risks of household energy use, as well as differentiated gender impacts from household energy practices, WHO is leading an effort with countries and surveying agencies (e.g. USAID’s DHS, UNICEF’S MICS, World Bank’s LSMS) to enhance, harmonize and pilot questions for national censuses and surveys. The effort will ensure that surveys better capture information on all the fuels and technologies used in the home for cooking, heating and lighting, as well as other impacts like time lost to fuel collection disaggregated by sex.WHO also supports international initiatives to improve air pollution and related health impacts such as the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves and the Climate Clean Air Coalition.\n",

The effort will also survey to better capture information on all the fuels and technologies used in the home for cooking, heating and lighting, as well as other impacts like time lost to fuel collection.WHO also contributes to the development and updating of the global tracking framework used to measure progress toward the UN Secretary-General’s Sustainable Energy for All initiative target of universal access to clean energy by 2030.WHO also supports international initiatives to improve air pollution and related health impacts such as the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves and the Climate Clean Air Coalition.\n",

      "BackgroundOutdoor air pollution is a major environmental health problem affecting everyone in developed and developing countries alike.WHO estimates that in 2012, some 72% of outdoor air pollution-related premature deaths were due to ischaemic heart disease and strokes, while 14% of deaths were due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or acute lower respiratory infections, and 14% of deaths were due to lung cancer.Some deaths may be attributed to more than one risk factor at the same time. For example, both smoking and ambient air pollution affect lung cancer. Some lung cancer deaths could have been averted by improving ambient air quality, or by reducing tobacco smoking.A 2013 assessment by WHO’s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) concluded that outdoor air pollution is carcinogenic to humans, with the particulate matter component of air pollution most closely associated with increased cancer incidence, especially cancer of the lung. An association also has been observed between outdoor air pollution and increase in cancer of the urinary tract/bladder.Ambient (outdoor air pollution) in both cities and rural areas was estimated to cause 3 million premature deaths worldwide per year in 2012; this mortality is due to exposure to small particulate matter of 10 microns or less in diameter (PM10), which cause cardiovascular and respiratory disease, and cancers.People living in low- and middle-income countries disproportionately experience the burden of outdoor air pollution with 87% (of the 3 million premature deaths) occurring in low- and middle-income countries, and the greatest burden in the WHO Western Pacific and South-East Asia regions. The latest burden estimates reflect the very significant role air pollution plays in cardiovascular illness and premature deaths – much more so than was previously understood by scientists.Most sources of outdoor air pollution are well beyond the control of individuals and demand action by cities, as well as national and international policymakers in sector like transport, energy waste management, buildings and agriculture.There are many examples of successful policies in transport, urban planning, power generation and industry that reduce air pollution:for industry: clean technologies that reduce industrial smokestack emissions; improved management of urban and agricultural waste, including capture of methane gas emitted from waste sites as an alternative to incineration (for use as biogas);for transport: shifting to clean modes of power generation; prioritizing rapid urban transit, walking and cycling networks in cities as well as rail interurban freight and passenger travel; shifting to cleaner heavy duty diesel vehicles and low-emissions vehicles and fuels, including fuels with reduced sulfur content;for urban planning: improving the energy efficiency of buildings and making cities more compact, and thus energy efficient;for power generation: increased use of low-emissions fuels and renewable combustion-free power sources (like solar, wind or hydropower); co-generation of heat and power; and distributed energy generation (e.g. mini-grids and rooftop solar power generation);for municipal and agricultural waste management: strategies for waste reduction, waste separation, recycling and reuse or waste reprocessing; as well as improved methods of biological waste management such as anaerobic waste digestion to produce biogas, are feasible, low cost alternatives to the open incineration of solid waste. Where incineration is unavoidable, then combustion technologies with strict emission controls are critical.In addition to outdoor air pollution, indoor smoke is a serious health risk for some 3 billion people who cook and heat their homes with biomass fuels and coal. Some 4.3 million premature deaths were attributable to household air pollution in 2012. Almost all of that burden was in low-middle-income countries as well.The 2005 \"WHO Air quality guidelines\" offer global guidance on thresholds and limits for key air pollutants that pose health risks. The Guidelines indicate that by reducing particulate matter (PM10) pollution from 70 to 20 micrograms per cubic metre (μg/m), we can cut air pollution-related deaths by around 15%.The Guidelines apply worldwide and are based on expert evaluation of current scientific evidence for:particulate matter (PM)ozone (O3)nitrogen dioxide (NO2) andsulfur dioxide (SO2), in all WHO regions.Particulate matterDefinition and principal sourcesPM affects more people than any other pollutant. The major components of PM are sulfate, nitrates, ammonia, sodium chloride, black carbon, mineral dust and water. It consists of a complex mixture of solid and liquid particles of organic and inorganic substances suspended in the air. The most health-damaging particles are those with a diameter of 10 microns or less, (≤ PM10), which can penetrate and lodge deep inside the lungs. Chronic exposure to particles contributes to the risk of developing cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, as well as of lung cancer.Air quality measurements are typically reported in terms of daily or annual mean concentrations of PM10 particles per cubic meter of air volume (m3). Routine air quality measurements typically describe such PM concentrations in terms of micrograms per cubic meter (μg/m3). When sufficiently sensitive measurement tools are available, concentrations of fine particles (PM2.5 or smaller), are also reported.\n",

      "There is a close, quantitative relationship between exposure to high concentrations of small particulates (PM10 and PM2.5) and increased mortality or morbidity, both daily and over time. Conversely, when concentrations of small and fine particulates are reduced, related mortality will also go down – presuming other factors remain the same. This allows policymakers to project the population health improvements that could be expected if particulate air pollution is reduced.Small particulate pollution have health impacts even at very low concentrations – indeed no threshold has been identified below which no damage to health is observed. Therefore, the WHO 2005 guideline limits aimed to achieve the lowest concentrations of PM possible.\n",

Progress towards the guideline values, however, should be the ultimate objective.The effects of PM on health occur at levels of exposure currently being experienced by many people both in urban and rural areas and in developed and developing countries – although exposures in many fast-developing cities today are often far higher than in developed cities of comparable size.\"WHO Air Quality Guidelines\" estimate that reducing annual average particulate matter (PM10) concentrations from levels of 70 μg/m3, common in many developing cities, to the WHO guideline level of 20 μg/m3, could reduce air pollution-related deaths by around 15%. However, even in the European Union, where PM concentrations in many cities do comply with Guideline levels, it is estimated that average life expectancy is 8.6 months lower than it would otherwise be, due to PM exposures from human sources.In developing countries, indoor exposure to pollutants from the household combustion of solid fuels on open fires or traditional stoves increases the risk of acute lower respiratory infections and associated mortality among young children; indoor air pollution from solid fuel use is also a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer among adults.There are serious risks to health not only from exposure to PM, but also from exposure to ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2). As with PM, concentrations are often highest largely in the urban areas of low- and middle-income countries. Ozone is a major factor in asthma morbidity and mortality, while nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide also can play a role in asthma, bronchial symptoms, lung inflammation and reduced lung function.\n",

It is formed by the reaction with sunlight (photochemical reaction) of pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) from vehicle and industry emissions and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by vehicles, solvents and industry. As a result, the highest levels of ozone pollution occur during periods of sunny weather.Health effectsExcessive ozone in the air can have a marked effect on human health. It can cause breathing problems, trigger asthma, reduce lung function and cause lung diseases. In Europe it is currently one of the air pollutants of most concern. Several European studies have reported that the daily mortality rises by 0.3% and that for heart diseases by 0.4%, per 10 µg/m3 increase in ozone exposure.\n",

Studies indicate that a proportion of people with asthma experience changes in pulmonary function and respiratory symptoms after periods of exposure to SO2 as short as 10 minutes.The (2005) revision of the 24-hour guideline for SO2 concentrations from 125 to 20 μg/m3 was based on the following considerations.Health effects are now known to be associated with much lower levels of SO2than previously believed.A greater degree of protection is needed.Although the causality of the effects of low concentrations of SO2 is still uncertain, reducing SO2 concentrations is likely to decrease exposure to co-pollutants.Definition and principal sourcesSO2 is a colourless gas with a sharp odour. It is produced from the burning of fossil fuels (coal and oil) and the smelting of mineral ores that contain sulfur. The main anthropogenic source of SO2 is the burning of sulfur-containing fossil fuels for domestic heating, power generation and motor vehicles.Health effectsSO2 can affect the respiratory system and the functions of the lungs, and causes irritation of the eyes. Inflammation of the respiratory tract causes coughing, mucus secretion, aggravation of asthma and chronic bronchitis and makes people more prone to infections of the respiratory tract. Hospital admissions for cardiac disease and mortality increase on days with higher SO2 levels. When SO2 combines with water, it forms sulfuric acid; this is the main component of acid rain which is a cause of deforestation.\n",

      "Alcohol is a psychoactive substance with dependence-producing properties that has been widely used in many cultures for centuries. The harmful use of alcohol causes a large disease, social and economic burden in societies.Alcohol impacts people and societies in many ways and it is determined by the volume of alcohol consumed, the pattern of drinking, and, on rare occasions, the quality of alcohol consumed. In 2012, about 3.3 million deaths, or 5.9 % of all global deaths, were attributable to alcohol consumption.The harmful use of alcohol can also result in harm to other people, such as family members, friends, co-workers and strangers. Moreover, the harmful use of alcohol results in a significant health, social and economic burden on society at large.Alcohol consumption is a causal factor in more than 200 disease and injury conditions. Drinking alcohol is associated with a risk of developing health problems such as mental and behavioural disorders, including alcohol dependence, major noncommunicable diseases such as liver cirrhosis, some cancers and cardiovascular diseases, as well as injuries resulting from violence and road clashes and collisions.A significant proportion of the disease burden attributable to alcohol consumption arises from unintentional and intentional injuries, including those due to road traffic crashes, violence, and suicides, and fatal alcohol-related injuries tend to occur in relatively younger age groups.The latest causal relationships are those between harmful drinking and incidence of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis as well as the course of HIV/AIDS.

      "\n",
      "A variety of factors have been identified at the individual and the societal level, which affect the levels and patterns of alcohol consumption and the magnitude of alcohol-related problems in populations.Environmental factors include economic development, culture, availability of alcohol, and the comprehensiveness and levels of implementation and enforcement of alcohol policies. For a given level or pattern of drinking, vulnerabilities within a society are likely to have similar differential effects as those between societies. Although there is no single risk factor that is dominant, the more vulnerabilities a person has, the more likely the person is to develop alcohol-related problems as a result of alcohol consumption.Conceptual causal model of alcohol consumption and health outcomesThe impact of alcohol consumption on chronic and acute health outcomes in populations is largely determined by 2 separate but related dimensions of drinking:the total volume of alcohol consumed, andthe pattern of drinking.The context of drinking plays an important role in occurrence of alcohol-related harm, particularly associated with health effects of alcohol intoxication, and, on rare occasions, also the quality of alcohol consumed. Alcohol consumption can have an impact not only on the incidence of diseases, injuries and other health conditions, but also on the course of disorders and their outcomes in individuals.There are gender differences in alcohol-related mortality, morbidity, as well as levels and patterns of alcohol consumption. The percentage of alcohol-attributable deaths among men amount to 7.6 % of all global deaths compared to 4.0 % of all deaths among women. Total alcohol per capita consumption in 2010 among male and female drinkers worldwide was on average 21.2 litres for males and 8.9 litres of pure alcohol for females.\n",

The resolution urges countries to strengthen national responses to public health problems caused by the harmful use of alcohol.The global strategy to reduce the harmful use of alcohol represents a collective commitment by WHO Member States to reduce the global burden of disease caused by harmful use of alcohol. The strategy includes evidence-based policies and interventions that can protect health and save lives if adopted, implemented and enforced. The strategy also contains a set of principles to guide the development and implementation of policies; it sets priority areas for global action, recommends target areas for national action and gives a strong mandate to WHO to strengthen action at all levels.The policy options and interventions available for national action can be grouped into 10 recommended target areas, which are mutually supportive and complementary. The 10 areas are:leadership, awareness and commitmenthealth services’ responsecommunity actiondrink–driving policies and countermeasuresavailability of alcoholmarketing of alcoholic beveragespricing policiesreducing the negative consequences of drinking and alcohol intoxicationreducing the public health impact of illicit alcohol and informally produced alcoholmonitoring and surveillance.The Global Information System on Alcohol and Health (GISAH) has been developed by WHO to dynamically present data on levels and patterns of alcohol consumption, alcohol-attributable health and social consequences and policy responses at all levels.Successful implementation of the strategy will require action by countries, effective global governance and appropriate engagement of all relevant stakeholders. By effectively working together, the negative health and social consequences of alcohol can be reduced.FootnotesBased on the Global status report on alcohol and health 2014.The Global strategy refers only to public-health effects of alcohol consumption, without prejudice to religious beliefs and cultural norms in any way. The concept of “harmful use of alcohol” in this context is different from “harmful use of alcohol” as a diagnostic category in the ICD-10 Classification of Mental and Behavioural Disorders (WHO, 1992).The disability-adjusted life year (DALY) extends the concept of potential years of life lost due to premature death to include equivalent years of \"healthy\" life lost by virtue of being in states of poor health or disability.\n",

      "Resistance in bacteriaAntibiotic resistance is present in every country.Patients with infections caused by drug-resistant bacteria are at increased risk of worse clinical outcomes and death, and consume more health-care resources than patients infected with non-resistant strains of the same bacteria.Resistance in Klebsiella pneumoniae – common intestinal bacteria that can cause life-threatening infections – to a last resort treatment (carbapenem antibiotics) has spread to all regions of the world. K. pneumoniae is a major cause of hospital-acquired infections such as pneumonia, bloodstream infections, and infections in newborns and intensive-care unit patients. In some countries, because of resistance, carbapenem antibiotics do not work in more than half of people treated for K. pneumoniae infections.Resistance in E. coli to one of the most widely used medicines for the treatment of urinary tract infections (fluoroquinolone antibiotics) is very widespread. There are countries in many parts of the world where this treatment is now ineffective in more than half of patients.Treatment failure to the last resort of medicine for gonorrhoea (third generation cephalosporin antibiotics) has been confirmed in at least 10 countries (Australia, Austria, Canada, France, Japan, Norway, Slovenia, South Africa, Sweden and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland).WHO recently updated the treatment guidelines for gonorrhoea to address emerging resistance. The new WHO guidelines do not recommend quinolones (a class of antibiotic) for the treatment of gonorrhoea due to widespread high levels of resistance. In addition, treatment guidelines for chlamydial infections and syphilis were also updated.Resistance to first-line drugs to treat infections caused by Staphlylococcus aureus—a common cause of severe infections in health facilities and the community—is widespread. People with MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) are estimated to be 64% more likely to die than people with a non-resistant form of the infection.Colistin is the last resort treatment for life-threatening infections caused by Enterobacteriaceae which are resistant to carbapenems.

The proportion is higher among people previously treated for TB, at 20%.Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB), a form of tuberculosis that is resistant to at least 4 of the core anti-TB drugs, has been identified in 105 countries. An estimated 9.7% of people with MDR-TB have XDR-TB.\n",

      "As of July 2016, resistance to the first-line treatment for P. falciparum malaria (artemisinin-based combination therapies, also known as ACTs) has been confirmed in 5 countries of the Greater Mekong subregion (Cambodia, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Thailand and Viet Nam). In most places, patients with artemisinin-resistant infections recover fully after treatment, provided that they are treated with an ACT containing an effective partner drug. However, along the Cambodia-Thailand border, P. falciparum has become resistant to almost all available antimalarial medicines, making treatment more challenging and requiring close monitoring. There is a real risk that multidrug resistance will soon emerge in other parts of the subregion as well.The spread of resistant strains to other parts of the world could pose a major public health challenge and jeopardize important recent gains in malaria control.A \"WHO Strategy for Malaria Elimination in the Greater Mekong subregion (2015-2030)\" was endorsed by all 5 countries, as well as China.\n",

      "In 2010, an estimated 7% of people starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) in developing countries had drug-resistant HIV. In developed countries, the same figure was 10–20%. Some countries have recently reported levels at or above 15% amongst those starting HIV treatment, and up to 40% among people re-starting treatment. This requires urgent attention.Increasing levels of resistance have important economic implications as second and third-line regimens are 3 times and 18 times more expensive, respectively, than first-line drugs.Since September 2015, WHO has recommended that everyone living with HIV start on antiretroviral treatment . Greater use of ART is expected to further increase ART resistance in all regions of the world. To maximize the long-term effectiveness of first-line ART regimens, and to ensure that people are taking the most effective regimen, it is essential to continue monitoring resistance and to minimize its further emergence and spread. In consultation with countries, partners and stakeholders, WHO is currently developing a new \"Global Action Plan for HIV Drug Resistance (2017-2021)\".\n",

      "IntroductionAntibiotics are medicines used to prevent and treat bacterial infections. Antibiotic resistance occurs when bacteria change in response to the use of these medicines.Bacteria, not humans or animals, become antibiotic-resistant. These bacteria may infect humans and animals, and the infections they cause are harder to treat than those caused by non-resistant bacteria.Antibiotic resistance leads to higher medical costs, prolonged hospital stays, and increased mortality.The world urgently needs to change the way it prescribes and uses antibiotics. Even if new medicines are developed, without behaviour change, antibiotic resistance will remain a major threat. Behaviour changes must also include actions to reduce the spread of infections through vaccination, hand washing, practising safer sex, and good food hygiene.\n",

A growing list of infections – such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, blood poisoning and gonorrhoea – are becoming harder, and sometimes impossible, to treat as antibiotics become less effective.Where antibiotics can be bought for human or animal use without a prescription, the emergence and spread of resistance is made worse. Similarly, in countries without standard treatment guidelines, antibiotics are often over-prescribed by health workers and veterinarians and over-used by the public.Without urgent action, we are heading for a post-antibiotic era, in which common infections and minor injuries can once again kill.\n",

      "Brazzaville, 8 June 2015 - Blood safety experts have agreed to develop robust blood transfusion services (BTS) in Ebola affected and unaffected countries to enhance preparedness for future outbreaks of infections with epidemic potential. Strengthening BTS would also have a direct benefit for tackling regional public health priorities including maternal and child mortality.During a meeting held at the WHO Regional Office for Africa in Brazzaville (Congo) from 2 to 4 June 2015, experts consolidated plans to strengthen BTS in Ebola affected and unaffected countries, and adopted a series of recommendations. These include the validation of plans to strengthen national BTS and their integration into their health systems recovery plans, the funding of BTS plans by governments and partners, the review of strategic plans for blood safety and the establishment of a regional blood safety network.\"We must strengthen our blood safety services, develop human resources capacities and reinforce logistics. If the ministries of health and the governments are fully committed to supporting our plans we will go far,\" said Mrs. Lwopu M. Bruce, Programme Manager of the National Blood Transfusion Service of Liberia. The World Health Organization and its partners will provide support to countries at various levels, including resource mobilization for the implementation of National BTS plans, advocacy for integrating blood safety in the national health development plans, and strengthening the legal and regulatory framework for blood safety.Speaking on behalf of the Director, Health Systems and Services Cluster at the WHO Regional Office for Africa, Dr Ossy Kasilo, Coordinator, Health Technologies Programme, urged countries \"to validate blood safety plans, and advocate vigorously and rapidly for their integration into their health system recovery plans. The national BTS have a crucial role to play in the response to the epidemic as long as cases of Ebola virus disease are still occurring.\"\"Liberia is now free of Ebola and both Guinea and Sierra Leone are making progress towards making zero cases. This is the time to redouble efforts to ensure that this outbreak is brought to an end. The goal of achieving zero cases in the last countries affected by the epidemic and the establishment of robust preparedness plans in these countries and in those that are not affected by Ebola must be a top priority for all countries\", said Dr Kasilo.The Brazzaville meeting also stressed the need for BTS to ensure that their voices are heard in the setting of the national health agenda, and to continue enrolment into the ongoing studies on the use of convalescent blood (CB) and convalescent plasma (CP) for transfusions of Ebola patients.The meeting was attended by BTS Programme Managers in countries affected by Ebola and those that share land borders with them (Côte d'Ivoire, Gambia, Guinea Bissau, Mali and Senegal), those with experience in the fight against the epidemic (Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria) and national health authorities of these countries.The health partners present at the meeting were among others: African Union, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation-Unites States, UNFPA, Safe Blood for Africa, CDC Atlanta, and Clinical Research and Management-United States.Clinical trials of the CB and CP in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone are also supported by the following partners: Institute of Tropical Medicine Antwerp-Belgium, Pasteur Institute-France, Etablissement Français du Sang-France, University of Liverpool, Oxford University, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine-United Kingdom, Clinical Research Management-United States, and Doctors without Borders._____________________________________For additional information, please contact:Technical contacts:Dr Ossy M.J.

In this regard:125 countries have national guidelines on the appropriate clinical use of blood.Transfusion committees are present in 67% of the hospitals performing transfusions in high-income countries and in 34% of the hospitals in middle- and low- income countries.Clinical audits are conducted in 54% of hospitals performing transfusion in high-income countries and in 42% of hospitals in the middle- and low- income countries.Systems for reporting adverse transfusion events are present in 92% of hospitals performing transfusion in high-income countries and 40% in middle- and low- income countries.72% of high-income countries have a national haemovigilance system, compared to only 28% of middle- and low-income countries.\n",

In the low-income countries, up to 65% of transfusions are for children under the age of 5 years.In high-income countries, transfusion is most commonly used for supportive care in cardiovascular surgery, transplant surgery, massive trauma, and therapy for solid and haematological malignancies. In low- and middle-income countries it is used more often to manage pregnancy-related complications and severe childhood anaemia.\n",

      "The risk of transmission of serious infections, including HIV and hepatitis, through unsafe blood and chronic blood shortages brought global attention to the importance of blood safety and availability. With the goal of ensuring universal access to safe blood and blood products, WHO has been at the forefront to improve blood safety and availability, and recommends the following integrated strategy for blood safety and availability:Establishment of a national blood system with well-organized and coordinated blood transfusion services, effective evidence-based and ethical national blood policies, and legislation and regulation, that can provide sufficient and timely supplies of safe blood and blood products to meet the transfusion needs of all patients.Collection of blood, plasma and other blood components from low-risk, regular, voluntary unpaid donors through the strengthening of donation systems, and effective donor management, including care and counselling.Quality-assured screening of all donated blood for transfusion-transmissible infections (TTIs), including HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C and syphilis, confirmatory testing of the results of all donors screen-reactive for infection markers, blood grouping and compatibility testing, and systems for processing blood into blood products (blood components for transfusion and plasma derived-medicinal products), as appropriate, to meet health care needs.Rational use of blood and blood products to reduce unnecessary transfusions and minimize the risks associated with transfusion, the use of alternatives to transfusion, where possible, and safe and good clinical transfusion practices, including patient blood management.Step-wise implementation of effective quality systems, including quality management, standards, good manufacturing practices, documentation, training of all staff, and quality assessmentThrough its Blood and Transfusion Safety programme, WHO supports countries in developing national blood systems to ensure timely access to safe and sufficient supplies of blood and blood products and good transfusion practices to meet the patients’ needs. The programme provides policy guidance and technical assistance to countries for ensuring universal access to safe blood and blood products and work towards self-sufficiency in safe blood and blood products based on voluntary unpaid blood donation to achieve universal health coverage.\n",

The disease may progress with no pain or fever. Without treatment or sometimes during antibiotics treatment, the nodule, plaque or oedema will ulcerate within 4 weeks. Bone is occasionally affected, causing deformities.The disease has been classified into three categories of severity: Category I, single small lesion (32%) less than 5 cm on diameter; Category II, non-ulcerative and ulcerative plaque and oedematous forms between 5-15 cm (35%); and Category III lesions more than 15 cm in diameter including, disseminated and mixed forms such as, osteomyelitis and joint involvement, lesions at critical sites (head, breast, genitalia), (33%).Lesions frequently occur in the limbs: 35% on the upper limbs, 55% on the lower limbs, and 10% on the other parts of the body. Health workers should be careful in the diagnosis of Buruli ulcer in patients with lower leg lesions to avoid confusion with other causes of ulceration such as diabetes, arterial and venous insufficiency lesion. \n",

      "Differential diagnoses of Buruli ulcer include tropical phagedenic ulcers, chronic lower leg ulcers due to arterial and venous insufficiency (often in elderly populations), diabetic ulcers, cutaneous leishmaniasis, extensive ulcerative yaws and ulcers caused by Haemophilus ducreyi.Early nodular and papular lesions may be confused with insect bite, boils, lipomas, ganglions, lymph node tuberculosis, onchocerciasis nodules or deep fungal subcutaneous infections. Cellulitis may look like oedema caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans infection but in the case of cellulitis, there is pain and fever. Four standard laboratory methods can be used to confirm Buruli ulcer: IS2404 polymerase chain reaction (PCR), direct microscopy, histopathology and culture. The bacterium grows best at temperatures between 29–33 °C (Mycobacterium tuberculosis grows at 37 °C) and needs a low (2.5%) oxygen concentration.In 2019, WHO established the Buruli ulcer Laboratory Network for Africa to help strengthen PCR confirmation in 9 endemic countries in Africa. Thirteen laboratories participate in this network, supported by the American Leprosy Missions, Anesvad, Raoul Follereau Foundation and coordinated by the Pasteur Center of Cameroon.In 2021, WHO completed an online consultation for a draft document on Target Product Profiles to develop rapid test for the diagnosis of Buruli ulcer. With the availability of simple oral treatment for Buruli ulcer, a rapid test to allow early confirmation of diagnosis can facilitate the timely treatment of the disease. The current turnaround time of a PCR test is too long to guide early treatment decisions.\n",

      "Treatment consists of a combination of antibiotics and complementary treatments.

Interventions such as wound and lymphoedema management and surgery (mainly debridement and skin grafting) are used to speed up healing, thereby shortening the duration of hospitalization. Physiotherapy is needed in severe cases to prevent disability. Those left with disability require long-term rehabilitation. These same interventions are applicable to other neglected tropical diseases, such as leprosy and lymphatic filariasis.The WHO has developed a treatment guidance for health workers.HIV infection complicates the management of the patient, making clinical progression more aggressive and resulting in poor treatment outcomes.

      "Approximately 70% of deaths from cancer occur in low- and middle-income countries.\n",
      "Around one third of deaths from cancer are due to the 5 leading behavioral and dietary risks: high body mass index, low fruit and vegetable intake, lack of physical activity, tobacco use, and alcohol use.\n",

      "Late-stage presentation and inaccessible diagnosis and treatment are common. In 2015, only 35% of low-income countries reported having pathology services generally available in the public sector. More than 90% of high-income countries reported treatment services are available compared to less than 30% of low-income countries.\n",

      "\n",
      "Cancer arises from the transformation of normal cells into tumour cells in a multistage process that generally progresses from a pre-cancerous lesion to a malignant tumour. These changes are the result of the interaction between a person's genetic factors and 3 categories of external agents, including:physical carcinogens, such as ultraviolet and ionizing radiation;chemical carcinogens, such as asbestos, components of tobacco smoke, aflatoxin (a food contaminant), and arsenic (a drinking water contaminant); andbiological carcinogens, such as infections from certain viruses, bacteria, or parasites.WHO, through its cancer research agency, International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), maintains a classification of cancer-causing agents.Ageing is another fundamental factor for the development of cancer. The incidence of cancer rises dramatically with age, most likely due to a build-up of risks for specific cancers that increase with age. The overall risk accumulation is combined with the tendency for cellular repair mechanisms to be less effective as a person grows older.\n",

Approximately 15% of cancers diagnosed in 2012 were attributed to carcinogenic infections, including Helicobacter pylori, Human papillomavirus (HPV), Hepatitis B virus, Hepatitis C virus, and Epstein-Barr virus3.Hepatitis B and C virus and some types of HPV increase the risk for liver and cervical cancer, respectively.

      "Cancer mortality can be reduced if cases are detected and treated early. There are 2 components of early detection:Early diagnosisWhen identified early, cancer is more likely to respond to effective treatment and can result in a greater probability of surviving, less morbidity, and less expensive treatment. Significant improvements can be made in the lives of cancer patients by detecting cancer early and avoiding delays in care.Early diagnosis consists of 3 steps that must be integrated and provided in a timely manner:awareness and accessing careclinical evaluation, diagnosis and stagingaccess to treatment.Early diagnosis is relevant in all settings and the majority of cancers. In absence of early diagnosis, patients are diagnosed at late stages when curative treatment may no longer be an option. Programmes can be designed to reduce delays in, and barriers to, care, allowing patients to access treatment in a timely manner.ScreeningScreening aims to identify individuals with abnormalities suggestive of a specific cancer or pre-cancer who have not developed any symptoms and refer them promptly for diagnosis and treatment.Screening programmes can be effective for select cancer types when appropriate tests are used, implemented effectively, linked to other steps in the screening process and when quality is assured. In general, a screening programme is a far more complex public health intervention compared to early diagnosis.Examples of screening methods are:visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) for cervical cancer in low-income settings;HPV testing for cervical cancer;PAP cytology test for cervical cancer in middle- and high-income settings; andmammography screening for breast cancer in settings with strong or relatively strong health systems.\n",

      "\n",
      "Cervical cancer is caused by the sexually transmitted human papillomavirus (HPV), which is the most common viral infection of the reproductive tract. It affects younger age groups as a result of early sexual activity, multiple sexual partners, and exposure to other sexually transmitted infections such as HIV.There are more than 100 types of HPV, of which at least 13 are cancer-causing. Two types of HPV cause 70% of all cervical cancer. Most sexually active men and women will be infected at some point in their lives with HPV – some may be repeatedly infected.The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates HPV infections cause approximately 68 000 cases of cervical cancer each year in Africa. However, these figures most likely represent a conservative estimate due to the health challenges in health information systems and cancer registries in the Region.Cervical cancer is a preventable disease. Yet it is the most common cause of cancer in the African Region where it accounts for 22% of all female cancers and 12% of all newly diagnosed cancer in both men and women every year. In Africa, 34 out of every 100 000 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer and 23 out of every 100 000 women die from cervical cancer every year.This figure compares with 7 out of every 100 000 women being diagnosed with cervical cancer and 3 out of every 100 000 women dying of the disease every year in North America. In Africa, most of these women are diagnosed at advanced stage of cancer which is associated with poor outcomes.There is a safe and very effective vaccine that protects against HPV and it has the potential to prevent one third of all cases of cervical cancer. Two HPV vaccines are certified safe by WHO and are intended for use in girls between age 9 and 13 years. The vaccine produces the highest immune response at this age and it is important to receive the vaccine before exposure to HPV.Routine cervical cancer screening and early treatment can prevent up to 80% of cervical cancers if abnormali-ties of the cervix are identified at stages when they can be easily treated. WHO recommends screening for all women aged 30–49 years to identify precancerous lesions, which are usually asymptomatic. HPV vaccination is vital but does not replace the necessity of cervical cancer screening and early treatment in women.It is very important that all women in the target age group are screened, irrespective of their HPV vaccination status, and treated if precancerous lesion is identified. The vast difference in cervical cancer incidence in developing versus developed countries is a reflection of the absence of national cervical cancer screening and treatment programmes in majority of developing countries.In many parts of Africa, cervical cancers are not identified or treated until advanced stages due to insufficient access to reproductive health care services, effective screening and early treatment.Approximately one third of all cancers can be prevented. This highlights the importance of legislative and regulatory measures, as well as health promotion interventions that advocate for HPV vaccination, improved access to physical activity and healthy diet, and against tobacco and the harmful use of alcohol.“Cervical cancer is a preventable disease and affects far too many women in the African Region. There is an urgent need to integrate cancer control programmes into existing primary sexual and reproductive health care services, strengthen multisectoral collaboration, and improve public health awareness in order to tackle this devastating disease,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa.Strategies to address cervical cancer and achieve treatment for all need to deal with health inequities that arise from the societal conditions in which women are born, grow, live and work to mitigate barriers to childhood development, education, employment, housing and environment. They also need to address cultural and socioeconomic factors that negatively affect cancer screening, early detection and care.In order to reduce the cervical cancer burden in the African Region, WHO will continue to support Ministries of Health to implement priority cancer prevention and control interventions that cuts across the continuum of prevention, early detection, diagnosis, treatment and palliative care services.Together, we can fight women’s cancer through public-private partnerships\n",

      "An estimated 17.7 million people died from CVDs in 2015, representing 31% of all global deaths. Of these deaths, an estimated 7.4 million were due to coronary heart disease and 6.7 million were due to stroke .\n",
      "Over three quarters of CVD deaths take place in low- and middle-income countries.\n",

      "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a group of disorders of the heart and blood vessels and they include:coronary heart disease – disease of the blood vessels supplying the heart muscle;cerebrovascular disease – disease of the blood vessels supplying the brain;peripheral arterial disease – disease of blood vessels supplying the arms and legs;rheumatic heart disease – damage to the heart muscle and heart valves from rheumatic fever, caused by streptococcal bacteria;congenital heart disease – malformations of heart structure existing at birth;deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism – blood clots in the leg veins, which can dislodge and move to the heart and lungs.Heart attacks and strokes are usually acute events and are mainly caused by a blockage that prevents blood from flowing to the heart or brain. The most common reason for this is a build-up of fatty deposits on the inner walls of the blood vessels that supply the heart or brain. Strokes can also be caused by bleeding from a blood vessel in the brain or from blood clots. The cause of heart attacks and strokes are usually the presence of a combination of risk factors, such as tobacco use, unhealthy diet and obesity, physical inactivity and harmful use of alcohol, hypertension, diabetes and hyperlipidaemia.\n",

      "The most important behavioural risk factors of heart disease and stroke are unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, tobacco use and harmful use of alcohol. The effects of behavioural risk factors may show up in individuals as raised blood pressure, raised blood glucose, raised blood lipids, and overweight and obesity. These “intermediate risks factors” can be measured in primary care facilities and indicate an increased risk of developing a heart attack, stroke, heart failure and other complications.Cessation of tobacco use, reduction of salt in the diet, consuming fruits and vegetables, regular physical activity and avoiding harmful use of alcohol have been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. In addition, drug treatment of diabetes, hypertension and high blood lipids may be necessary to reduce cardiovascular risk and prevent heart attacks and strokes. Health policies that create conducive environments for making healthy choices affordable and available are essential for motivating people to adopt and sustain healthy behaviour.There are also a number of underlying determinants of CVDs or \"the causes of the causes\". These are a reflection of the major forces driving social, economic and cultural change – globalization, urbanization and population ageing. Other determinants of CVDs include poverty, stress and hereditary factors.\n",

As a result, many people in low- and middle-income countries are detected late in the course of the disease and die younger from CVDs and other noncommunicable diseases, often in their most productive years.The poorest people in low- and middle-income countries are affected most. At the household level, sufficient evidence is emerging to prove that CVDs and other noncommunicable diseases contribute to poverty due to catastrophic health spending and high out-of-pocket expenditure.At macro-economic level, CVDs place a heavy burden on the economies of low- and middle-income countries.\n",

      "“Best buys” or very cost effective interventions that are feasible to be implemented even in low-resource settings have been identified by WHO for prevention and control of cardiovascular diseases. They include two types of interventions: population-wide and individual, which are recommended to be used in combination to reduce the greatest cardiovascular disease burden.Examples of population-wide interventions that can be implemented to reduce CVDs include:comprehensive tobacco control policiestaxation to reduce the intake of foods that are high in fat, sugar and saltbuilding walking and cycle paths to increase physical activitystrategies to reduce harmful use of alcoholproviding healthy school meals to children.At the individual level, for prevention of first heart attacks and strokes, individual health-care interventions need to be targeted to those at high total cardiovascular risk or those with single risk factor levels above traditional thresholds, such as hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. The former approach is more cost-effective than the latter and has the potential to substantially reduce cardiovascular events. This approach is feasible in primary care in low-resource settings, including by non-physician health workers.For secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease in those with established disease, including diabetes, treatment with the following medications are necessary:aspirinbeta-blockersangiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitorsstatins.The benefits of these interventions are largely independent, but when used together with smoking cessation, nearly 75% of recurrent vascular events may be prevented. Currently there are major gaps in the implementation of these interventions particularly at the primary health care level.In addition costly surgical operations are sometimes required to treat CVDs. They include:coronary artery bypassballoon angioplasty (where a small balloon-like device is threaded through an artery to open the blockage)valve repair and replacementheart transplantationartificial heart operationsMedical devices are required to treat some CVDs. Such devices include pacemakers, prosthetic valves, and patches for closing holes in the heart.\n",

      "Under the leadership of the WHO, all Member States ( 194 countries) agreed in 2013 on global mechanisms to reduce the avoidable NCD burden including a \"Global action plan for the prevention and control of NCDs 2013-2020\". This plan aims to reduce the number of premature deaths from NCDs by 25% by 2025 through nine voluntary global targets. Two of the global targets directly focus on preventing and controlling CVDs.Global action plan for the prevention and control of NCDs 2013-2020The sixth target in the Global NCD action plan calls for 25% reduction in the global prevalence of raised blood pressure. Raised blood pressure is the leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The global prevalence of raised blood pressure (defined as systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure more than or equal to 140/90 mmHg) in adults aged 18 years and over was around 24.1% in men and 20.1% in women in 2015. The number of adults with raised blood pressure increased from 594 million in 1975 to 1.13 billion in 2015, with the increase largely in low- and middle-income countries.Reducing the incidence of hypertension by implementing population-wide policies to reduce behavioural risk factors, including harmful use of alcohol, physical inactivity, overweight, obesity and high salt intake, is essential to attaining this target. A total-risk approach needs to be adopted for early detection and cost-effective management of hypertension in order to prevent heart attacks, strokes and other complications.The eighth target in the Global NCD action plan states at least 50% of eligible people should receive drug therapy and counselling (including glycaemic control) to prevent heart attacks and strokes. Prevention of heart attacks and strokes through a total cardiovascular risk approach is more cost-effective than treatment decisions based on individual risk factor thresholds only and should be part of the basic benefits package for pursuing universal health coverage. Achieving this target will require strengthening key health system components, including health-care financing to ensure access to basic health technologies and essential NCD medicines.In 2015, countries will begin to set national targets and measure progress on the 2010 baselines reported in the \"Global status report on noncommunicable diseases 2014\". The UN General Assembly will convene a third high-level meeting on NCDs in 2018 to take stock of national progress in attaining the voluntary global targets by 2025.\n",

The joint pain is often very debilitating, but usually lasts for a few days or may be prolonged to weeks. Hence the virus can cause acute, subacute or chronic disease.Most patients recover fully, but in some cases joint pain may persist for several months, or even years. Occasional cases of eye, neurological and heart complications have been reported, as well as gastrointestinal complaints. Serious complications are not common, but in older people, the disease can contribute to the cause of death.

These mosquitoes can be found biting throughout daylight hours, though there may be peaks of activity in the early morning and late afternoon. Both species are found biting outdoors, but Ae. aegypti will also readily feed indoors.After the bite of an infected mosquito, onset of illness occurs usually between 4 and 8 days but can range from 2 to 12 days.\n",

Samples collected during the first week after the onset of symptoms should be tested by both serological and virological methods (RT-PCR).The virus may be isolated from the blood during the first few days of infection. Various reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR) methods are available but are of variable sensitivity. Some are suited to clinical diagnosis. RT–PCR products from clinical samples may also be used for genotyping of the virus, allowing comparisons with virus samples from various geographical sources.\n",

      "The proximity of mosquito vector breeding sites to human habitation is a significant risk factor for chikungunya as well as for other diseases that these species transmit. Prevention and control relies heavily on reducing the number of natural and artificial water-filled container habitats that support breeding of the mosquitoes. This requires mobilization of affected communities. During outbreaks, insecticides may be sprayed to kill flying mosquitoes, applied to surfaces in and around containers where the mosquitoes land, and used to treat water in containers to kill the immature larvae.For protection during outbreaks of chikungunya, clothing which minimizes skin exposure to the day-biting vectors is advised. Repellents can be applied to exposed skin or to clothing in strict accordance with product label instructions. Repellents should contain DEET (N, N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide), IR3535 (3-[N-acetyl-N-butyl]-aminopropionic acid ethyl ester) or icaridin (1-piperidinecarboxylic acid, 2-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-methylpropylester). For those who sleep during the daytime, particularly young children, or sick or older people, insecticide-treated mosquito nets afford good protection. Mosquito coils or other insecticide vaporizers may also reduce indoor biting.Basic precautions should be taken by people travelling to risk areas and these include use of repellents, wearing long sleeves and pants and ensuring rooms are fitted with screens to prevent mosquitoes from entering.\n",

      "Chikungunya occurs in Africa, Asia and the Indian subcontinent. Human infections in Africa have been at relatively low levels for a number of years, but in 1999–2000 there was a large outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and in 2007 there was an outbreak in Gabon.Starting in February 2005, a major outbreak of chikungunya occurred in islands of the Indian Ocean. A large number of imported cases in Europe were associated with this outbreak, mostly in 2006 when the Indian Ocean epidemic was at its peak. A large outbreak of chikungunya in India occurred in 2006 and 2007. Several other countries in South-East Asia were also affected. Since 2005, India, Indonesia, Maldives, Myanmar and Thailand have reported over 1.9 million cases. In 2007 transmission was reported for the first time in Europe, in a localized outbreak in north-eastern Italy. There were 197 cases recorded during this outbreak and it confirmed that mosquito-borne outbreaks by Ae. Albopictus are plausible in Europe.In December 2013, France reported 2 laboratory-confirmed autochthonous cases in the French part of the Caribbean island of St Martin. Since then, local transmission has been confirmed in over 43 countries and territories in the WHO Region of the Americas. This is the first documented outbreak of chikungunya with autochthonous transmission in the Americas. As of April 2015, over 1 379 788 suspected cases of Chikungunya have been recorded in the Caribbean islands, Latin American countries, and the United States of America. 191 deaths have also been attributed to this disease during the same period. Canada, Mexico and USA have also recorded imported cases.On 21 October 2014, France confirmed 4 cases of locally-acquired chikungunya infection in Montpellier, France. In late 2014, outbreaks were reported in the Pacific islands. Currently chikungunya outbreak is ongoing in Cook Islands and Marshall Islands, while the number of cases in American Samoa, French Polynesia, Kiribati and Samoa has reduced. WHO responded to small outbreaks of chikungunya in late 2015 in the city of Dakar, Senegal, and the state of Punjab, India.In the Americas in 2015, 693 489 suspected cases and 37480 confirmed cases of chikungunya were reportedto the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) regional office, of which Colombia bore the biggest burden with 356 079 suspected cases. This was less than in 2014 when more than 1 million suspected cases were reported in the same region.In 2016 there was a total of 349 936 suspected and 146 914 laboratory confirmed cases reported to the PAHO regional office, half the burden compared to the previous year. Countries reporting most cases were Brazil (265 000 suspected cases), Bolivia and Colombia (19 000 suspected cases, respectively). 2016 is the first time that autochthonous transmission of chikungunya was reported in Argentina following an outbreak of more than 1 000 suspected cases. In the African region, Kenya reported an outbreak of chikungunya resulting in more than 1 700 suspected cases. In 2017, Pakistan continues to respond to an outbreak which started in 2016.\n",

      "Both Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus have been implicated in large outbreaks of chikungunya. Whereas Ae. aegypti is confined within the tropics and sub-tropics, Ae. albopictus also occurs in temperate and even cold temperate regions. In recent decades Ae. albopictus has spread from Asia to become established in areas of Africa, Europe and the Americas.The species Ae. albopictus thrives in a wider range of water-filled breeding sites than Ae. aegypti, including coconut husks, cocoa pods, bamboo stumps, tree holes and rock pools, in addition to artificial containers such as vehicle tyres and saucers beneath plant pots. This diversity of habitats explains the abundance of Ae. albopictus in rural as well as peri-urban areas and shady city parks.Ae. aegypti is more closely associated with human habitation and uses indoor breeding sites, including flower vases, water storage vessels and concrete water tanks in bathrooms, as well as the same artificial outdoor habitats as Ae. albopictus.In Africa several other mosquito vectors have been implicated in disease transmission, including species of the A. furcifer-taylori group and A. luteocephalus. There is evidence that some animals, including non-primates, rodents, birds and small mammals, may act as reservoirs.\n",

      "Scope of the problemChild maltreatment is a global problem with serious life-long consequences. In spite of recent national surveys in several low- and middle-income countries, data from many countries are still lacking.Child maltreatment is complex and difficult to study. Current estimates vary widely depending on the country and the method of research used. Estimates depend on:the definitions of child maltreatment used;the type of child maltreatment studied;the coverage and quality of official statistics;the coverage and quality of surveys that request self-reports from victims, parents or caregivers.Nonetheless, international studies reveal that a quarter of all adults report having been physically abused as children and 1 in 5 women and 1 in 13 men report having been sexually abused as a child. Additionally, many children are subject to emotional abuse (sometimes referred to as psychological abuse) and to neglect.Every year, there are an estimated 41 000 homicide deaths in children under 15 years of age. This number underestimates the true extent of the problem, as a significant proportion of deaths due to child maltreatment are incorrectly attributed to falls, burns, drowning and other causes.In armed conflict and refugee settings, girls are particularly vulnerable to sexual violence, exploitation and abuse by combatants, security forces, members of their communities, aid workers and others.\n",

A number of characteristics of an individual child may increase the likelihood of being maltreated:being either under four years old or an adolescentbeing unwanted, or failing to fulfil the expectations of parentshaving special needs, crying persistently or having abnormal physical features.Parent or caregiverA number of characteristics of a parent or caregiver may increase the risk of child maltreatment. These include:difficulty bonding with a newbornnot nurturing the childhaving been maltreated themselves as a childlacking awareness of child development or having unrealistic expectationsmisusing alcohol or drugs, including during pregnancybeing involved in criminal activityexperiencing financial difficulties.RelationshipA number of characteristics of relationships within families or among intimate partners, friends and peers may increase the risk of child maltreatment. These include:physical, developmental or mental health problems of a family memberfamily breakdown or violence between other family membersbeing isolated in the community or lacking a support networka breakdown of support in child rearing from the extended family.Community and societal factorsA number of characteristics of communities and societies may increase the risk of child maltreatment.

      "Preventing child maltreatment requires a multisectoral approach. Effective programmes are those that support parents and teach positive parenting skills. These include:visits by nurses to parents and children in their homes to provide support, education, and information;parent education, usually delivered in groups, to improve child-rearing skills, increase knowledge of child development, and encourage positive child management strategies; andmulti-component interventions, which typically include support and education of parents, pre-school education, and child care.Other prevention programmes have shown some promise.Programmes to prevent abusive head trauma (also referred to as shaken baby syndrome, shaken infant syndrome and inflicted traumatic brain injury). These are usually hospital-based programmes targeting new parents prior to discharge from the hospital, informing of the dangers of shaken baby syndrome and advising on how to deal with babies that cry inconsolably.Programmes to prevent child sexual abuse. These are usually delivered in schools and teach children about:body ownershipthe difference between good and bad touchhow to recognize abusive situationshow to say \"no\"how to disclose abuse to a trusted adult.Such programmes are effective at strengthening protective factors against child sexual abuse (e.g. knowledge of sexual abuse and protective behaviours), but evidence about whether such programmes reduce other kinds of abuse is lacking.The earlier such interventions occur in children's lives, the greater the benefits to the child (e.g. cognitive development, behavioural and social competence, educational attainment) and to society (e.g. reduced delinquency and crime).In addition, early case recognition coupled with ongoing care of child victims and families can help reduce reoccurrence of maltreatment and lessen its consequences.To maximize the effects of prevention and care, WHO recommends that interventions are delivered as part of a four-step public health approach:defining the problem;identifying causes and risk factors;designing and testing interventions aimed at minimizing the risk factors;disseminating information about the effectiveness of interventions and increasing the scale of proven effective interventions.\n",

      "Who is most at risk?Newborns2.7 million babies die every year in their first month of life and a similar number are stillborn. Within the first month, up to half of all deaths occur within the first 24 hours of life, and 75% occur in the first week. The 48 hours immediately following birth is the most crucial period for newborn survival. This is when the mother and child should receive follow-up care to prevent and treat illness.Globally, the number of neonatal deaths declined from 5.1 million in 1990 to 2.7 million in 2015. However, the decline in neonatal mortality from 1990 to 2015 has been slower than that of post-neonatal under-5 mortality: 47% compared with 58% globally. This pattern applies to most low- and middle-income countries. If current trends continue, around half of the 69 million child deaths between 2016 and 2030 will occur during the neonatal period. The share of neonatal deaths is projected to increase from 45% of under-5 deaths in 2015 to 52% in 2030. Moreover, 63 countries need to accelerate progress to reach the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target of a neonatal mortality rate of 12 deaths per 1000 live births by 2030.Prior to birth, a mother can increase her child's chance of survival and good health by attending antenatal care consultations, being immunized against tetanus, and avoiding smoking and use of alcohol.At the time of birth, a baby's chance of survival increases significantly with delivery in a health facility in the presence of a skilled birth attendant. After birth, essential care of a newborn should include:ensuring that the baby is breathing;starting the newborn on exclusive breastfeeding right away;keeping the baby warm; andwashing hands before touching the baby.Identifying and caring for illnesses in a newborn is very important, as a baby can become very ill and die quickly if an illness is not recognized and treated appropriately. Sick babies must be taken immediately to a trained health care provider.\n",

      "Substantial global progress has been made in reducing child deaths since 1990. The number of under-5 deaths worldwide has declined from 12.7 million in 1990 to 5.9 million in 2015 – 16 000 every day compared with 35 000 in 1990. Since 1990, the global under-5 mortality rate has dropped 53%, from 91 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1990 to 43 in 2015.The world as a whole has been accelerating progress in reducing the under-5 mortality rate. Promisingly, sub-Saharan Africa, the region with the highest under-5 mortality rate in the world, has also registered a substantive acceleration. Its annual rate of reduction increased from 1.6 % in 1990s to 4.1 % in 2000–2015. The remarkable decline in under-5 mortality since 2000 has saved the lives of 48 million children under age 5.Between 1990 and 2015, 62 of the 195 countries with available estimates met the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 4 target of a two-thirds reduction in the under-5 mortality rate. Among them, 24 are low- and lower-middle income countries.Despite these gains, progress was insufficient to reach MDG 4 globally and in many regions. Currently, 79 countries have an under-5 mortality rate above 25 deaths per 1000 live births, and 47 of them will not meet the proposed SDG target of 25 deaths per 1000 live births by 2030 if they continue their current trends in reducing under-5 mortality. Among these 47 countries, 34 are in sub-Saharan Africa. The acceleration needed to reach the goals in those 47 countries is substantial – 30 countries must at least double their current rate of reduction, and 11 of those 30 countries must at least triple their current rate of reduction.Wide gaps in child mortality across sub-groups or areas within countries have been documented, warranting a call for an equity-focused approach to reducing child mortality. Children are at greater risk of dying before age 5 if they are born in rural areas, poor households, or to a mother denied basic education.More than half of under-5 child deaths are due to diseases that are preventable and treatable through simple, affordable interventions. Strengthening health systems to provide such interventions to all children will save many young lives.Malnourished children, particularly those with severe acute malnutrition, have a higher risk of death from common childhood illness such as diarrhoea, pneumonia, and malaria. Nutrition-related factors contribute to about 45% of deaths in children under 5 years of age.\n",

The SDG goal 3 target 3.2 is to end preventable deaths of newborns and under-5 children by 2030.Target 3.2 is closely linked with target 3.1, to reduce the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 deaths per 100 000 live births, and target 2.2 on ending all forms of malnutrition, as malnutrition is a frequent cause of death for under-5 children. These have been translated into the new \"Global Strategy for Women’s, Children’s and Adolescent’s Health\" (Global Strategy), which calls for ending preventable child deaths while addressing emerging child health priorities.To achieve the SDG targets, the global community has set goals and targets for tackling the unfinished child survival agenda to achieve under-5 mortality of 25 or fewer deaths per 1000 live births by 2030. This has been translated into several global initiatives:\"ending preventable maternal mortality\" and \"every newborn action plan\" to promote universal coverage of high quality maternal and newborn care;the \"global action plan for the prevention and treatment of pneumonia and diarrhoea\";a \"comprehensive implementation plan on maternal, and infant and young child nutrition\" to reduce under nutrition and obesity;the \"Global Technical Strategy for Malaria\" to reduce global malaria case incidence and mortality by 2030;the \"Global Vaccine Action Plan\" to prevent childhood diseases through vaccination; andthe United Nations Decade of Action on Nutrition 2016–2025 to eradicate hunger and prevent all forms of malnutrition worldwide.Member States need to set targets and develop specific strategies to reduce child mortality and monitor progress.\n",

      "OverviewUndernutrition is estimated to be associated with 2.7 million child deaths annually or 45% of all child deaths. Infant and young child feeding is a key area to improve child survival and promote healthy growth and development. The first 2 years of a child’s life are particularly important, as optimal nutrition during this period lowers morbidity and mortality, reduces the risk of chronic disease, and fosters better development overall.Optimal breastfeeding is so critical that it could save the lives of over 800 000 children under the age of 5 years each year.WHO and UNICEF recommend:early initiation of breastfeeding within 1 hour of birth;exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life; andintroduction of nutritionally-adequate and safe complementary (solid) foods at 6 months together with continued breastfeeding up to 2 years of age or beyond.However, many infants and children do not receive optimal feeding. For example, only about 36% of infants aged 0–6 months worldwide were exclusively breastfed over the period of 2007-2014.Recommendations have been refined to also address the needs for infants born to HIV-infected mothers. Antiretroviral drugs now allow these children to exclusively breastfeed until they are 6 months old and continue breastfeeding until at least 12 months of age with a significantly reduced risk of HIV transmission.\n",

      "Exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months has many benefits for the infant and mother. Chief among these is protection against gastrointestinal infections which is observed not only in developing but also industrialized countries. Early initiation of breastfeeding, within 1 hour of birth, protects the newborn from acquiring infections and reduces newborn mortality. The risk of mortality due to diarrhoea and other infections can increase in infants who are either partially breastfed or not breastfed at all.Breast-milk is also an important source of energy and nutrients in children aged 6–23 months. It can provide half or more of a child’s energy needs between the ages of 6 and 12 months, and one third of energy needs between 12 and 24 months. Breast-milk is also a critical source of energy and nutrients during illness, and reduces mortality among children who are malnourished.Children and adolescents who were breastfed as babies are less likely to be overweight or obese. Additionally, they perform better on intelligence tests and have higher school attendance. Breastfeeding is associated with higher income in adult life. Improving child development and reducing health costs results in economic gains for individual families as well as at the national level.1Longer durations of breastfeeding also contribute to the health and well-being of mothers: it reduces the risk of ovarian and breast cancer and helps space pregnancies–exclusive breastfeeding of babies under 6 months has a hormonal effect which often induces a lack of menstruation. This is a natural (though not fail-safe) method of birth control known as the Lactation Amenorrhoea Method.Mothers and families need to be supported for their children to be optimally breastfed. Actions that help protect, promote and support breastfeeding include:adoption of policies such as the International Labour Organization’s \"Maternity Protection Convention 183\" and \"Recommendation No. 191\", which complements \"Convention No. 183\" by suggesting a longer duration of leave and higher benefits;adoption of the \"International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes\" and subsequent relevant World Health Assembly resolutions;implementation of the \"Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding\" specified in the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative, including:skin-to-skin contact between mother and baby immediately after birth and initiation of breastfeeding within the first hour of life;breastfeeding on demand (that is, as often as the child wants, day and night);rooming-in (allowing mothers and infants to remain together 24 hours a day);not giving babies additional food or drink, even water, unless medically necessary;provision of supportive health services with infant and young child feeding counselling during all contacts with caregivers and young children, such as during antenatal and postnatal care, well-child and sick child visits, and immunization; andcommunity support, including mother support groups and community-based health promotion and education activities.Breastfeeding practices are highly responsive to supportive interventions, and the prevalence of exclusive and continued breastfeeding can be improved over the course of a few years.\n",

      "Around the age of 6 months, an infant’s need for energy and nutrients starts to exceed what is provided by breast milk, and complementary foods are necessary to meet those needs. An infant of this age is also developmentally ready for other foods. If complementary foods are not introduced around the age of 6 months, or if they are given inappropriately, an infant’s growth may falter. Guiding principles for appropriate complementary feeding are:continue frequent, on-demand breastfeeding until 2 years of age or beyond;practise responsive feeding (for example, feed infants directly and assist older children. Feed slowly and patiently, encourage them to eat but do not force them, talk to the child and maintain eye contact);practise good hygiene and proper food handling;start at 6 months with small amounts of food and increase gradually as the child gets older;gradually increase food consistency and variety;increase the number of times that the child is fed: 2–3 meals per day for infants 6–8 months of age and 3–4 meals per day for infants 9–23 months of age, with 1–2 additional snacks as required;use fortified complementary foods or vitamin-mineral supplements as needed; andduring illness, increase fluid intake including more breastfeeding, and offer soft, favourite foods.\n",

Infection is more common when there is a shortage of adequate sanitation and hygiene and safe water for drinking, cooking and cleaning. Rotavirus and Escherichia coli, are the two most common etiological agents of moderate-to-severe diarrhoea in low-income countries. Other pathogens such as cryptosporidium and shigella species may also be important. Location-specific etiologic patterns also need to be considered.Malnutrition: Children who die from diarrhoea often suffer from underlying malnutrition, which makes them more vulnerable to diarrhoea. Each diarrhoeal episode, in turn, makes their malnutrition even worse. Diarrhoea is a leading cause of malnutrition in children under five years old.Source: Water contaminated with human faeces, for example, from sewage, septic tanks and latrines, is of particular concern. Animal faeces also contain microorganisms that can cause diarrhoea.Other causes: Diarrhoeal disease can also spread from person-to-person, aggravated by poor personal hygiene. Food is another major cause of diarrhoea when it is prepared or stored in unhygienic conditions.Unsafe domestic water storage and handling is also an important risk factor. Fish and seafood from polluted water may also contribute to the disease.\n",

ORS is a mixture of clean water, salt and sugar. It costs a few cents per treatment. ORS is absorbed in the small intestine and replaces the water and electrolytes lost in the faeces.Zinc supplements: zinc supplements reduce the duration of a diarrhoea episode by 25% and are associated with a 30% reduction in stool volume.Rehydration: with intravenous fluids in case of severe dehydration or shock.Nutrient-rich foods: the vicious circle of malnutrition and diarrhoea can be broken by continuing to give nutrient-rich foods – including breast milk – during an episode, and by giving a nutritious diet – including exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life – to children when they are well.Consulting a health professional , in particular for management of persistent diarrhoea or when there is blood in stool or if there are signs of dehydration.\n",

      "In 2013, an estimated 6.3 million children under five died, 2.9 million of them in the WHO African Region. This is equivalent to five children under 5 years of age dying every minute. Two thirds of these deaths can be attributed to preventable causes. A third of all these deaths are in the neonatal period.Pneumonia, diarrhoea, malaria and HIV are the main causes of death in infants and young children. In the African Region, about 473 000 children die from pneumonia, 300 000 from diarrhoea, and a further 443 000 from malaria every year. In 2012, 230 000 new HIV infections were recorded among children under 5 years of age.“Although tremendous progress has been made in identifying and treating infants and children with HIV, much remains to be done to scale-up and sustain effective prevention, care and treatment, especially of pneumonia and diarrhoea,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa.Pneumonia is the single biggest killer of children worldwide, accounting for nearly one in seven deaths among young children, with an estimated over 950 000 deaths annually. Most of the deaths occur in resource-constrained countries, with 50% in sub-Saharan Africa.Globally, diarrhoeal diseases account for nearly one out of every six deaths in children under 5 years of age, equivalent to over 578 000 deaths per year. Diarrhoeal disease occurs more commonly in HIV-infected people, with worse outcomes than in uninfected children. Persistent diarrhoea in particular is associated with a high risk of death in HIV-infected children. Administration of oral rehydration and zinc in combination with antiretroviral therapy (ART) and restoring immune function are critical for the treatment of diarrhoea in children with HIV.“Undernutrition is another critical risk factor in most countries in the African Region, and nutrition and food security remains a fundamental challenge to child survival. Breastfeeding is one of the best ways to provide newborns, infants and young children with the nutrients that they need while protecting them against conditions like pneumonia, diarrhoea and undernutrition,” Dr Moeti added.The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that exclusive breastfeeding starts within one hour after birth and lasts until a baby is six months old. Continued breastfeeding and appropriate complementary foods should be made available for up to 2 years of age and beyond.In mid-2013, WHO issued new guidelines for breastfeeding and the prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV. These recommendations were intended for use in resource-poor settings in low-and middle-income countries.One of the recommendations for PMTCT is to promote the use of ART in all pregnant and breastfeeding women. These recommendations also include providing ART - irrespective of one’s CD4 count - to all children under 5 years of age with HIV, all pregnant, and all breastfeeding women with HIV including their infants until they cease to breastfeed.Health systems in Africa are often not able to adequately address the severe burden of childhood disease. Low total health expenditure with high out of pocket health costs hamper progress in child survival. Hence just as health can drive economic growth, ill-health can push people into poverty and make it very difficult for them to escape the vicious cycle of poverty and disease.  WHO will continue to work with governments and partners to strengthen health systems to reduce unacceptably high infant and child deaths in the African Region.______________________________________________For more information, please contact: Technical contacts:Dr Kasonde Mwinga; Tel: +472 413 9189; Email: mwingak@who.intDr Phanuel Habimana; Tel: +472 413 9407; Email: habimanap@who.int Media contact:Dr Cory Couillard; Tel: + 472 413 9995; Email: couillardc@who.int\n",

      "Cholera is an acute diarrhoeal disease that can kill within hours if left untreated.\n",
      "Researchers have estimated that each year there are 1.3 to 4.0 million cases of cholera, and 21 000 to 143 000 deaths worldwide due to cholera1.\n",
      "Most of those infected will have no or mild symptoms, and can be successfully treated with oral rehydration solution.\n",
      "Severe cases will need rapid treatment with intravenous fluids and antibiotics.\n",
      "Provision of safe water and sanitation is critical to control the transmission of cholera and other waterborne diseases.\n",
      "Oral cholera vaccines are an additional way to control cholera, but should not replace conventional control measures.\n",

      "Cholera is an extremely virulent disease that can cause severe acute watery diarrhoea. It takes between 12 hours and 5 days for a person to show symptoms after ingesting contaminated food or water (2). Cholera affects both children and adults and can kill within hours if untreated.\n",
      "Most people infected with V. cholerae do not develop any symptoms, although the bacteria are present in their faeces for 1-10 days after infection and are shed back into the environment, potentially infecting other people.\n",
      "Among people who develop symptoms, the majority have mild or moderate symptoms, while a minority develop acute watery diarrhoea with severe dehydration. This can lead to death if left untreated.\n",

      "\n",
      "During the 19th century, cholera spread across the world from its original reservoir in the Ganges delta in India. Six subsequent pandemics killed millions of people across all continents. The current (seventh) pandemic started in South Asia in 1961, and reached Africa in 1971 and the Americas in 1991. Cholera is now endemic in many countries.\n",

      "              \n",
      "\n",
      "There are many serogroups of V. cholerae, but only two – O1 and O139 – cause outbreaks. V. cholerae O1 has caused all recent outbreaks. V. cholerae O139 – first identified in Bangladesh in 1992 – caused outbreaks in the past, but recently has only been identified in sporadic cases. It has never been identified outside Asia. There is no difference in the illness caused by the two serogroups.\n",
      "The main reservoirs of V. cholerae are people and aquatic sources that are somewhat salty and warm such as estuaries and some coastal areas. Recent studies indicate that climate change creates a favourable environment for the bacteria that causes cholera (3).\n",

      "\n",
      "Cholera can be endemic or epidemic. A cholera-endemic area is an area where confirmed cholera cases were detected during 3 out of the last 5 years with evidence of local transmission (meaning the cases are not imported from elsewhere). A cholera outbreak/epidemic is defined by the occurrence of at least 1 confirmed case of cholera with evidence of local transmission in an area where there is not usually cholera.\n",
      "Cholera transmission is closely linked to inadequate access to clean water and sanitation facilities. Typical at-risk areas include peri-urban slums, where basic infrastructure is not available, as well as camps for internally displaced persons or refugees, where minimum requirements of clean water and sanitation have not been met.\n",
      "The consequences of a humanitarian crisis – such as disruption of water and sanitation systems, or the displacement of populations to inadequate and overcrowded camps – can increase the risk of cholera transmission, should the bacteria be present or introduced. Uninfected dead bodies have never been reported as the source of epidemics.\n",
      "The number of cholera cases reported to WHO has continued to be high over the last few years. During 2015,172 454 cases were notified from 42 countries, including 1304 deaths (4). The discrepancy between these figures and the estimated burden of the disease is due to the fact that many cases are not recorded due to limitations in surveillance systems and fear of impact on trade and tourism.\n",

The suspicion is then confirmed by identifying V. cholerae in stool samples from affected patients. Local capacity to detect (diagnose) and monitor (collect, compile, and analyse data) cholera occurrence is central to an effective surveillance system and to plan control measures.\n",
      "Countries neighbouring cholera-affected areas are encouraged to strengthen disease surveillance and national preparedness to rapidly detect and respond to outbreaks should cholera spread across borders. Under the International Health Regulations, notification of all cases of cholera is no longer mandatory.

      "Cholera is an easily treatable disease. The majority of people can be treated successfully through prompt administration of oral rehydration solution (ORS). The WHO/UNICEF ORS standard sachet is dissolved in 1 litre (L) of clean water. Adult patients may require up to 6 L of ORS to treat moderate dehydration on the first day.\n",
      "Severely dehydrated patients are at risk of shock and require the rapid administration of intravenous fluids. A 70 kg adult will require at least 7 L of intravenous fluid, plus ORS during their treatment. These patients are also given appropriate antibiotics to diminish the duration of diarrhoea, reduce the volume of rehydration fluids needed, and shorten the amount and duration of V. cholerae excretion in their stool.\n",
      "Mass administration of antibiotics is not recommended, as it has no proven effect on the spread of cholera and contributes to increasing antimicrobial resistance.\n",
      "Rapid access to treatment is essential during a cholera outbreak. Oral rehydration should be available in communities, in addition to larger centres that can provide intravenous fluids and 24 hour care. With early and proper treatment, the case fatality rate should remain below 1%.\n",

Funeral practices for individuals who die from cholera must be adapted to prevent infection among attendees. Breastfeeding should also be promoted.\n",
      "Further, awareness campaigns should be organised during outbreaks, and information should be provided to the community about the potential risks and symptoms of cholera, precautions to take to avoid cholera, when and where to report cases and to seek immediate treatment when symptoms appear.

      "Currently there are 3 WHO pre-qualified oral cholera vaccines: Dukoral®, Shanchol™, and Euvichol®. All 3 vaccines require 2 doses for full protection (5).\n",
      "Dukoral® is administered with a buffer solution that, for adults, requires 150 ml of clean water. As access to clean water is often limited in areas with cholera epidemics, Dukoral® is mainly used for travellers. Dukoral® provides approximately 65% protection against cholera for 2 years.\n",
      "Shanchol™ and Euvichol® are essentially the same vaccine produced by 2 different manufacturers. They do not require a buffer solution for administration, which makes them easier to administer to large numbers of people in emergency contexts. There must be a minimum of 2 weeks delay between each dose of these 2 vaccines. However, 1 dose of vaccine will provide some protection with the second dose given at a later date.\n",
      "Individuals vaccinated with Shanchol™ or Euvichol® have approximately 65% protection against cholera for up to 5 years following vaccination in endemic areas. The reduced circulation of V. cholerae bacteria in the population due to the reduced number of people with cholera further reduces cholera in the population. This additional protection is called herd protection.\n",
      "In 2013, WHO established a stockpile of 2 million doses for use in outbreak control and emergencies. The stockpile is managed by the International Coordinating Group (ICG) made up of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, Medecins Sans Frontieres, UNICEF, and WHO.\n",
      "For non-emergency settings, vaccines are available via the Global Task Force on Cholera Control (see WHO response section below). In these contexts, oral cholera vaccines (OCVs) are used as part of a longer-term cholera control plan including reinforcement of other aspects of cholera control. In eligible countries, financial support for vaccines is provided by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.\n",
      "More than 5 million doses of OCVs have been used in mass vaccination campaigns with WHO support. The campaigns have been implemented in areas experiencing an outbreak in areas at heightened vulnerability during humanitarian crises, and among populations living in highly endemic areas, known as “hotspots”.\n",
      "The use of OCVs has enabled the collection of evidence on and demonstration of the effectiveness and feasibility of implementating OCV campaigns as a public health tool, protecting populations at high risk of cholera.\n",

      "Cholera is an acute enteric infection caused by the ingestion of bacterium Vibrio cholerae present in faecally contaminated water or food. Primarily linked to insufficient access to safe water and proper sanitation, its impact can be even more dramatic in areas where basic environmental infrastructures are disrupted or have been destroyed. Countries facing complex emergencies are particularly vulnerable to cholera outbreaks. Massive displacement of IDPs or refugees to overcrowded settings, where the provision of potable water and sanitation is challenging, constitutes also a risk factor. In consequence, it is of paramount importance to be able to rely on accurate surveillance data to monitor the evolution of the outbreak and to put in place adequate intervention measures Coordination of the different sectors involved is essential, and WHO calls for the cooperation of all to limit the effect of cholera on populations.\n",
      "Cholera is characterized in its most severe form by a sudden onset of acute watery diarrhoea that can lead to death by severe dehydration. The extremely short incubation period - two hours to five days - enhances the potentially explosive pattern of outbreaks, as the number of cases can rise very quickly. About 75% of people infected with cholera do not develop any symptoms. However, the pathogens stay in their faeces for 7 to 14 days and are shed back into the environment, possibly infecting other individuals. Cholera is an extremely virulent disease that affects both children and adults. Unlike other diarrhoeal diseases, it can kill healthy adults within hours. Individuals with lower immunity, such as malnourished children or people living with HIV, are at greater risk of death if infected by cholera.\n",

      "Since the start of the outbreak on 10 May 2015, 4662 suspected/confirmed cholera cases and 34 deaths have been reported. Among these are 129 cases and 3 deaths among Tanzanians, mainly in Kagunga village, Kigoma urban and Karago village.\n",
      "The increasing numbers in affected local populations is worrisome and has prompted a scale-up of standard cholera prevention and control interventions as well as pre-emptive measures such as the use of oral cholera vaccines (OCV). These vaccines can contribute to preventing outbreaks among populations living in high risk areas, where usually recommended control measures are not sufficient.\n",
      "On Monday, 15 June 2015, the Kigoma Regional Commissioner convened the Regional Primary Health Care Committee to announce the vaccination campaign in high risk areas in the Kigoma region. The Committee agreed on details of how the campaign will be carried out and which high risk villages would receive the vaccine.\n",
      "The OCV campaign outside the camp will span four days with 28 vaccination teams targeting a population of 54 110. In addition to OCV, the Regional Commissioner emphasised that the provision of safe water, sanitation and personal hygiene will continue to be the main cholera prevention and control measures.\n",
      "“To support the campaign, WHO and partners have mobilized 164 500 doses of OCV and they will be provided to all refugees at the Nyarugusu camp, as well as at-risk Tanzanian communities neighbouring the camp, and identified villages such as Kagunga, Karago and Kigoma Ujiji,” says Dr Rufaro Chatora, World Health Organization (WHO) Representative for Tanzania.\n",
      "Dr Chatora says experience indicates that mass vaccination campaigns cannot be improvised at the last moment – they need careful, advanced planning and preparation, including improving risk assessment, identification of target populations and logistics.\n",
      "“Carrying out social mobilization, including door-to-door campaigns and health education is a key component to educate populations and inform district and community leaders about the disease. Additional staff from WHO and UNICEF have arrived to support the Regional Health Management Team and facilitate the coordination and preparation of the campaign in order to reach and protect as many people as we can,” Dr Chatora adds.\n",
      "To further prevent the spread to local populations, District Response teams are conducting targeted household water treatment with water guard in the affected families; strengthening disinfection in the households that have referred cases, intensifying hygiene promotion in the general communities and strengthening case management.\n",
      "WHO continues to support the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare to strengthen local health facilities along Lake Tanganyika’s shores by stocking them with enough medical supplies to treat new cholera cases and other common ailments.

      "More than 90% of COPD deaths occur in low­ and middle­income countries.\n",
      "The primary cause of COPD is exposure to tobacco smoke (either active smoking or second­hand smoke).\n",
      "Other risk factors include exposure to indoor and outdoor air pollution and occupational dusts and fumes.\n",
      "Some cases of COPD are due to long-term asthma.\n",
      "COPD is likely to increase in coming years due to higher smoking prevalence and aging populations in many countries.\n",
      "Many cases of COPD are preventable by avoidance or early cessation of smoking. Hence, it is important that countries adopt the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO-FCTC) and implement the MPOWER package of measures so that non-smoking becomes the norm globally.\n",

      "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a lung disease that is characterized by a persistent reduction of airflow. The symptoms of COPD are progressively worsening and persistent breathlessness on exertion, eventually leading to breathlessness at rest. It tends to be under­diagnosed and can be life­threatening.

The most common symptoms of COPD are breathlessness (or a \"need for air\"), chronic cough, and sputum (mucous) production. Daily activities, such as walking up a short flight of stairs or carrying a suitcase, and even daily routine activities can become very difficult as the condition gradually worsens. Sufferers also frequently experience exacerbations, that is, serious episodes of increased breathlessness, cough and sputum production that last from several days to a few weeks. These episodes can be seriously disabling and result in need for urgent medical care (including hospitalization) and sometimes death.\n",

      "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is usually suspected in people who experience the symptoms described above and can be confirmed by a breathing test called \"spirometry\" that measures how much and how quickly a person can forcibly exhale air.Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is not curable. However, available medical and physical treatments can help relieve symptoms, improve exercise capacity and quality of life and reduce the risk of death. The most effective and cost-effective available treatment for COPD in people who continue to smoke is smoking cessation. Smoking cessation can slow down the progress of the disease in smokers and decrease COPD-related deaths. In some, but not all, people with COPD, treatment with inhaled corticosteroid medicines has a beneficial effect.The availability of diagnostic and treatment options for COPD differs across varying resource settings. WHO has released a guideline with specific recommendations for COPD management in primary health care in resource constrained settings.\n",

      "WHO’s work on COPD is part of the Organization's overall efforts to prevent and control noncommunicable diseases. WHO aims to:raise awareness about the global epidemic of noncommunicable diseases;create more healthy environments, especially for poor and disadvantaged populations;decrease risk factors of noncommunicable disease, such as tobacco smoking and exposure to second-hand smoke, indoor and outdoor air pollution, unhealthy diet and physical inactivity;improve access to effective therapies for people with COPD; andprevent premature deaths and avoidable disabilities from major noncommunicable diseases.The WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control was developed in response to the globalization of the tobacco epidemic to protect billions of people from harmful exposure to tobacco. It is the first global health treaty negotiated by WHO, and has been ratified by 180 countries.WHO also leads the Global Alliance against Chronic Respiratory Diseases (GARD), a voluntary alliance of national and international organizations, institutions and agencies working towards the common goal of reducing the global burden of chronic respiratory diseases. Its vision is a world where all people breathe freely. GARD focuses specifically on the needs of low­ and middle-income countries and vulnerable populations.\n",

      "Over the last 50 years, human activities – particularly the burning of fossil fuels – have released sufficient quantities of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to trap additional heat in the lower atmosphere and affect the global climate.In the last 130 years, the world has warmed by approximately 0.85oC. Each of the last 3 decades has been successively warmer than any preceding decade since 18501.Sea levels are rising, glaciers are melting and precipitation patterns are changing. Extreme weather events are becoming more intense and frequent.\n",

      "Although global warming may bring some localized benefits, such as fewer winter deaths in temperate climates and increased food production in certain areas, the overall health effects of a changing climate are likely to be overwhelmingly negative.

In the heat wave of summer 2003 in Europe for example, more than 70 000 excess deaths were recorded2.High temperatures also raise the levels of ozone and other pollutants in the air that exacerbate cardiovascular and respiratory disease.Pollen and other aeroallergen levels are also higher in extreme heat. These can trigger asthma, which affects around 300 million people. Ongoing temperature increases are expected to increase this burden.\n",

      "\n",
      "Globally, the number of reported weather-related natural disasters has more than tripled since the 1960s. Every year, these disasters result in over 60 000 deaths, mainly in developing countries.Rising sea levels and increasingly extreme weather events will destroy homes, medical facilities and other essential services. More than half of the world's population lives within 60 km of the sea. People may be forced to move, which in turn heightens the risk of a range of health effects, from mental disorders to communicable diseases.Increasingly variable rainfall patterns are likely to affect the supply of fresh water. A lack of safe water can compromise hygiene and increase the risk of diarrhoeal disease, which kills approximately 760 000 children aged under 5, every year. In extreme cases, water scarcity leads to drought and famine. By the late 21st century, climate change is likely to increase the frequency and intensity of drought at regional and global scale1.Floods are also increasing in frequency and intensity, and the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation is expected to continue to increase throughout the current century1. Floods contaminate freshwater supplies, heighten the risk of water-borne diseases, and create breeding grounds for disease-carrying insects such as mosquitoes. They also cause drownings and physical injuries, damage homes and disrupt the supply of medical and health services.Rising temperatures and variable precipitation are likely to decrease the production of staple foods in many of the poorest regions. This will increase the prevalence of malnutrition and undernutrition, which currently cause 3.1 million deaths every year.\n",

      "Climatic conditions strongly affect water-borne diseases and diseases transmitted through insects, snails or other cold blooded animals.Changes in climate are likely to lengthen the transmission seasons of important vector-borne diseases and to alter their geographic range. For example, climate change is projected to widen significantly the area of China where the snail-borne disease schistosomiasis occurs3.Malaria is strongly influenced by climate. Transmitted by Anopheles mosquitoes, malaria kills almost 600 000 people every year – mainly African children under 5 years old. The Aedes mosquito vector of dengue is also highly sensitive to climate conditions, andstudies suggest that climate change is likely to continue to increase exposure to dengue.\n",

      "Many policies and individual choices have the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and produce major health co-benefits. For example, cleaner energy systems, and promoting the safe use of public transportation and active movement – such as cycling or walking as alternatives to using private vehicles – could reduce carbon emissions, and cut the burden of household air pollution, which causes some 4.3 million deaths per year, and ambient air pollution, which causes about 3 million deaths every year.In 2015, the WHO Executive Board endorsed a new work plan on climate change and health. This includes:Partnerships: to coordinate with partner agencies within the UN system, and ensure that health is properly represented in the climate change agenda.Awareness raising: to provide and disseminate information on the threats that climate change presents to human health, and opportunities to promote health while cutting carbon emissions.Science and evidence: to coordinate reviews of the scientific evidence on the links between climate change and health, and develop a global research agenda.Support for implementation of the public health response to climate change: to assist countries to build capacity to reduce health vulnerability to climate change, and promote health while reducing carbon emissions.\n",

Extreme weather events, variable climates that affect food and water supplies, ecosystem changes are all associated with global warming and pose health risks.Climate and weather already exert strong influences on health: increased deaths in heat waves, and in natural disasters such as floods, as well as changing patterns of life-threatening vector-borne diseases such as malaria and other existing and emerging infectious diseases are observed.Continuing climate change will affect, in profoundly adverse ways, some of the social and environmental determinants of health: food, air and water, according to WHO Director-General Dr Margaret Chan.

      "CCHF outbreaks have a case fatality rate of up to 40%.\n",
      "The virus is primarily transmitted to people from ticks and livestock animals. Human-to-human transmission can occur resulting from close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected persons.\n",

      "The hosts of the CCHF virus include a wide range of wild and domestic animals such as cattle, sheep and goats. Many birds are resistant to infection, but ostriches are susceptible and may show a high prevalence of infection in endemic areas, where they have been at the origin of human cases. For example, a former outbreak occurred at an ostrich abattoir in South Africa. There is no apparent disease in these animals.Animals become infected by the bite of infected ticks and the virus remains in their bloodstream for about one week after infection, allowing the tick-animal-tick cycle to continue when another tick bites. Although a number of tick genera are capable of becoming infected with CCHF virus, ticks of the genus Hyalomma are the principal vector.\n",

The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers and veterinarians.Human-to-human transmission can occur resulting from close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected persons. Hospital-acquired infections can also occur due to improper sterilization of medical equipment, reuse of needles and contamination of medical supplies.\n",

      "The length of the incubation period depends on the mode of acquisition of the virus. Following infection by a tick bite, the incubation period is usually one to three days, with a maximum of nine days. The incubation period following contact with infected blood or tissues is usually five to six days, with a documented maximum of 13 days.Onset of symptoms is sudden, with fever, myalgia, (muscle ache), dizziness, neck pain and stiffness, backache, headache, sore eyes and photophobia (sensitivity to light). There may be nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and sore throat early on, followed by sharp mood swings and confusion. After two to four days, the agitation may be replaced by sleepiness, depression and lassitude, and the abdominal pain may localize to the upper right quadrant, with detectable hepatomegaly (liver enlargement).Other clinical signs include tachycardia (fast heart rate), lymphadenopathy (enlarged lymph nodes), and a petechial rash (a rash caused by bleeding into the skin) on internal mucosal surfaces, such as in the mouth and throat, and on the skin. The petechiae may give way to larger rashes called ecchymoses, and other haemorrhagic phenomena. There is usually evidence of hepatitis, and severely ill patients may experience rapid kidney deterioration, sudden liver failure or pulmonary failure after the fifth day of illness.The mortality rate from CCHF is approximately 30%, with death occurring in the second week of illness. In patients who recover, improvement generally begins on the ninth or tenth day after the onset of illness.\n",

However, if samples have been inactivated (e.g. with virucides, gamma rays, formaldehyde, heat, etc.), they can be manipulated in a basic biosafety environment.\n",

      "\n",
      "Controlling CCHF in animals and ticksIt is difficult to prevent or control CCHF infection in animals and ticks as the tick-animal-tick cycle usually goes unnoticed and the infection in domestic animals is usually not apparent. Furthermore, the tick vectors are numerous and widespread, so tick control with acaricides (chemicals intended to kill ticks) is only a realistic option for well-managed livestock production facilities.For example, following an outbreak at an ostrich abattoir in South Africa (noted above), measures were taken to ensure that ostriches remained tick free for 14 days in a quarantine station before slaughter. This decreased the risk for the animal to be infected during its slaughtering and prevented human infection for those in contact with the livestock.There are no vaccines available for use in animals.Reducing the risk of infection in peopleAlthough an inactivated, mouse brain-derived vaccine against CCHF has been developed and used on a small scale in eastern Europe, there is currently no safe and effective vaccine widely available for human use.In the absence of a vaccine, the only way to reduce infection in people is by raising awareness of the risk factors and educating people about the measures they can take to reduce exposure to the virus.Public health advice should focus on several aspects.Reducing the risk of tick-to-human transmission:wear protective clothing (long sleeves, long trousers);wear light coloured clothing to allow easy detection of ticks on the clothes;use approved acaricides (chemicals intended to kill ticks) on clothing;use approved repellent on the skin and clothing;regularly examine clothing and skin for ticks; if found, remove them safely;seek to eliminate or control tick infestations on animals or in stables and barns; andavoid areas where ticks are abundant and seasons when they are most active.Reducing the risk of animal-to-human transmission:wear gloves and other protective clothing while handling animals or their tissues in endemic areas, notably during slaughtering, butchering and culling procedures in slaughterhouses or at home;quarantine animals before they enter slaughterhouses or routinely treat animals with pesticides two weeks prior to slaughter.Reducing the risk of human-to-human transmission in the community:avoid close physical contact with CCHF-infected people;wear gloves and protective equipment when taking care of ill people;wash hands regularly after caring for or visiting ill people.Controlling infection in health-care settingsHealth-care workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed CCHF, or handling specimens from them, should implement standard infection control precautions. These include basic hand hygiene, use of personal protective equipment, safe injection practices and safe burial practices.As a precautionary measure, health-care workers caring for patients immediately outside the CCHF outbreak area should also implement standard infection control precautions.Samples taken from people with suspected CCHF should be handled by trained staff working in suitably equipped laboratories.Recommendations for infection control while providing care to patients with suspected or confirmed Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever should follow those developed by WHO for Ebola and Marburg haemorrhagic fever.\n",

      "Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection.\n",
      "The infection causes flu-like illness, and occasionally develops into a potentially lethal complication called severe dengue.\n",
      "The global incidence of dengue has grown dramatically in recent decades. About half of the world's population is now at risk.\n",
      "Dengue is found in tropical and sub-tropical climates worldwide, mostly in urban and semi-urban areas.\n",
      "Severe dengue is a leading cause of serious illness and death among children in some Asian and Latin American countries.\n",
      "There is no specific treatment for dengue/ severe dengue, but early detection and access to proper medical care lowers fatality rates below 1%.\n",
      "Dengue prevention and control depends on effective vector control measures.\n",
      "A dengue vaccine has been licensed by several National Regulatory Authorities for use in people 9-45 years of age living in endemic settings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease that has rapidly spread in all regions of WHO in recent years. Dengue virus is transmitted by female mosquitoes mainly of the species Aedes aegypti and, to a lesser extent, Ae. albopictus. This mosquito also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever and Zika infection. Dengue is widespread throughout the tropics, with local variations in risk influenced by rainfall, temperature and unplanned rapid urbanization.\n",
      "Severe dengue (also known as Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever) was first recognized in the 1950s during dengue epidemics in the Philippines and Thailand. Today, severe dengue affects most Asian and Latin American countries and has become a leading cause of hospitalization and death among children and adults in these regions.\n",
      "There are 4 distinct, but closely related, serotypes of the virus that cause dengue (DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3 and DEN-4). Recovery from infection by one provides lifelong immunity against that particular serotype. However, cross-immunity to the other serotypes after recovery is only partial and temporary. Subsequent infections by other serotypes increase the risk of developing severe dengue.\n",

      "              \n",
      "\n",
      "The incidence of dengue has grown dramatically around the world in recent decades. The actual numbers of dengue cases are underreported and many cases are misclassified. One recent estimate indicates 390 million dengue infections per year (95% credible interval 284–528 million), of which 96 million (67–136 million) manifest clinically (with any severity of disease).1 Another study, of the prevalence of dengue, estimates that 3.9 billion people, in 128 countries, are at risk of infection with dengue viruses.2Member States in 3 WHO regions regularly report the annual number of cases.. The number of cases reported increased from 2.2 million in 2010 to 3.2 million in 2015. Although the full global burden of the disease is uncertain, the initiation of activities to record all dengue cases partly explains the sharp increase in the number of cases reported in recent years.Other features of the disease include its epidemiological patterns, including hyper-endemicity of multiple dengue virus serotypes in many countries and the alarming impact on both human health and the global and national economies.Before 1970, only 9 countries had experienced severe dengue epidemics. The disease is now endemic in more than 100 countries in the WHO regions of Africa, the Americas, the Eastern Mediterranean, South-East Asia and the Western Pacific. The America, South-East Asia and Western Pacific regions are the most seriously affected.Cases across the Americas, South-East Asia and Western Pacific exceeded 1.2 million in 2008 and over 3.2 million in 2015 (based on official data submitted by Member States). Recently the number of reported cases has continued to increase. In 2015, 2.35 million cases of dengue were reported in the Americas alone, of which 10 200 cases were diagnosed as severe dengue causing 1181 deaths.Not only is the number of cases increasing as the disease spreads to new areas, but explosive outbreaks are occurring. The threat of a possible outbreak of dengue fever now exists in Europe as local transmission was reported for the first time in France and Croatia in 2010 and imported cases were detected in 3 other European countries. In 2012, an outbreak of dengue on the Madeira islands of Portugal resulted in over 2 000 cases and imported cases were detected in mainland Portugal and 10 other countries in Europe. Among travellers returning from low- and middle-income countries, dengue is the second most diagnosed cause of fever after malaria.In 2013, cases have occurred in Florida (United States of America) and Yunnan province of China. Dengue also continues to affect several South American countries, notably Costa Rica, Honduras and Mexico. In Asia, Singapore has reported an increase in cases after a lapse of several years and outbreaks have also been reported in Laos. In 2014, trends indicate increases in the number of cases in the People's Republic of China, the Cook Islands, Fiji, Malaysia and Vanuatu, with Dengue Type 3 (DEN 3) affecting the Pacific Island countries after a lapse of over 10 years. Dengue was also reported in Japan after a lapse of over 70 years.In 2015, Delhi, India, recorded its worst outbreak since 2006 with over 15 000 cases. The Island of Hawaii, United States of America, was affected by an outbreak with 181 cases reported in 2015 and ongoing transmission in 2016. The Pacific island countries of Fiji, Tonga and French Polynesia have continued to record cases.The year 2016 was characterized by large dengue outbreaks worldwide. The Region of the Americas region reported more than 2.38 million cases in 2016, where Brazil alone contributed slightly less than 1.5 million cases, approximately 3 times higher than in 2014. 1032 dengue deaths were also reported in the region. The Western Pacific Region reported more than 375 000 suspected cases of dengue in 2016, of which the Philippines reported 176 411 and Malaysia 100 028 cases, representing a similar burden to the previous year for both countries. The Solomon Islands declared an outbreak with more than 7000 suspected. In the African Region, Burkina Faso reported a localized outbreak of dengue with 1061 probable cases.In 2017 (as of Epidemiological Week 11), the Region of Americas have reported 50 172 cases of dengue fever, a reduction as compared with corresponding periods in previous years. The Western Pacific Region has reported dengue outbreaks in several Member States in the Pacific, as well as the circulation of DENV-1 and DENV-2 serotypes.Number of Reported Cases of Dengue and Severe Dengue (SD) in the Americas, Epidemiological Week 11 (2017) pdf 61kbAn estimated 500 000 people with severe dengue require hospitalization each year, and about 2.5% of those affected die.\n",

      "\n",
      "The Aedes aegypti mosquito is the primary vector of dengue. The virus is transmitted to humans through the bites of infected female mosquitoes. After virus incubation for 4–10 days, an infected mosquito is capable of transmitting the virus for the rest of its life.Infected symptomatic or asymptomatic humans are the main carriers and multipliers of the virus, serving as a source of the virus for uninfected mosquitoes. Patients who are already infected with the dengue virus can transmit the infection (for 4–5 days; maximum 12) via Aedes mosquitoes after their first symptoms appear.The Aedes aegypti mosquito lives in urban habitats and breeds mostly in man-made containers. Unlike other mosquitoes Ae. aegypti is a day-time feeder; its peak biting periods are early in the morning and in the evening before dusk. Female Ae. aegyptibites multiple people during each feeding period.Aedes albopictus, a secondary dengue vector in Asia, has spread to North America and more than 25 countries in the European Region, largely due to the international trade in used tyres (a breeding habitat) and other goods (e.g. lucky bamboo). Ae. albopictus is highly adaptive and, therefore, can survive in cooler temperate regions of Europe. Its spread is due to its tolerance to temperatures below freezing, hibernation, and ability to shelter in microhabitats.\n",

      "Dengue fever is a severe, flu-like illness that affects infants, young children and adults, but seldom causes death.Dengue should be suspected when a high fever (40°C/104°F) is accompanied by 2 of the following symptoms: severe headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pains, nausea, vomiting, swollen glands or rash. Symptoms usually last for 2–7 days, after an incubation period of 4–10 days after the bite from an infected mosquito.Severe dengue is a potentially deadly complication due to plasma leaking, fluid accumulation, respiratory distress, severe bleeding, or organ impairment. Warning signs occur 3–7 days after the first symptoms in conjunction with a decrease in temperature (below 38°C/100°F) and include: severe abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, rapid breathing, bleeding gums, fatigue, restlessness and blood in vomit. The next 24–48 hours of the critical stage can be lethal; proper medical care is needed to avoid complications and risk of death.\n",

      "FactsheetKey FactsGlobally, the number of people living with diabetes rose from 200 million in 1990 to 830 million in 2022. The global prevalence of diabetes among adults aged 18 and above has more than doubled, increasing from 6.8% in 1990 to 14.1% in 2022[1],[2].Prevalence has been rising more rapidly in low- and middle-income countries than in high-income countries.In the WHO African Region, the prevalence of diabetes among adults aged 18 and above has surged from 6.4% in 1990 to a staggering 10.5% in 2022, nearly doubling in just over three decades[3],[4].The number of adults aged 18 and above living with diabetes in Africa has increased from 12 million in 1990 to 30 million in 2010 and reached 54 million in 2022[5],[6].In the African Region, only 26.1% of adults aged 30 and above diagnosed with diabetes receive treatment, leaving a staggering gap of over 34 million people living with diabetes who remain untreated[7],[8].Diabetes is a major cause of blindness, kidney failure, heart attacks, stroke and lower limb amputation1.In 2021, diabetes and kidney disease due to diabetes caused over 2 million deaths globally. In addition, around 11% of cardiovascular deaths were caused by high blood glucose1.In the African region, premature deaths from diabetes (defined as deaths occurring before the age of 70) stands at 58%, higher than the global average of 48%1.Almost half of all deaths attributable to high blood glucose occur before the age of 70 years1. WHO projects that diabetes will be the 7th leading cause of death in 2030 2.Healthy diet, regular physical activity, maintaining a normal body weight and avoiding tobacco use are ways to prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes1.Diabetes can be treated and its consequences avoided or delayed with diet, physical activity, medication and regular screening and treatment for complications1.People with diabetes are more likely to develop active TB disease and become sick once infected with TB germs than people without diabetes.[1] World Health Organization.Global health Observatory.

      "Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs either when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood sugar* . Hyperglycaemia, or raised blood sugar, is a common effect of uncontrolled diabetes and over time leads to serious damage to many of the body's systems, especially the nerves and blood vessels**.In 2022, 10.5% of adults aged 18 years and older in the WHO African Region had diabetes. Alarmingly, more than half of those with diabetes were unaware of their condition, and over 34 million people living with diabetes remained untreated.* Defined as fasting blood glucose equal to or higher than 7 mmol/L, or on medication for raised blood glucose, or with a history of diagnosis of diabetes.** High blood glucose is defined as a distribution of fasting plasma glucose in a population that is higher than the theoretical distribution that would minimize risks to health (derived from epidemiological studies). High blood glucose is a statistical concept, not a clinical or diagnostic category. \n",

      "The term ‘spinal cord injury’ refers to damage to the spinal cord resulting from trauma (e.g. a car crash) or from disease or degeneration (e.g. cancer). There is no reliable estimate of global prevalence, but estimated annual global incidence is 40 to 80 cases per million population. Up to 90% of these cases are due to traumatic causes, though the proportion of non-traumatic spinal cord injury appears to be growing.Symptoms of spinal cord injury depend on the severity of injury and its location on the spinal cord. Symptoms may include partial or complete loss of sensory function or motor control of arms, legs and/or body. The most severe spinal cord injury affects the systems that regulate bowel or bladder control, breathing, heart rate and blood pressure. Most people with spinal cord injury experience chronic pain.\n",

People with spinal cord injury are 2 to 5 times more likely to die prematurely than people without SCI.Mortality risk increases with injury level and severity and is strongly influenced by availability of timely, quality medical care. Transfer method to hospital after injury and time to hospital admission are important factors.Preventable secondary conditions (e.g. infections from untreated pressure ulcers) are no longer among the leading causes of death of people with spinal cord injury in high-income countries, but these conditions remain the main causes of death of people with spinal cord injury in low-income countries.\n",

      "Spinal cord injury is associated with a risk of developing secondary conditions that can be debilitating and even life-threatening—e.g. deep vein thrombosis, urinary tract infections, muscle spasms, osteoporosis, pressure ulcers, chronic pain, and respiratory complications. Acute care, rehabilitation services and ongoing health maintenance are essential for prevention and management of these conditions.Spinal cord injury may render a person dependent on caregivers. Assistive technology is often required to facilitate mobility, communication, self-care or domestic activities. An estimated 20-30% of people with spinal cord injury show clinically significant signs of depression, which in turn has a negative impact on improvements in functioning and overall health.Misconceptions, negative attitudes and physical barriers to basic mobility result in the exclusion of many people from full participation in society. Children with spinal cord injury are less likely than their peers to start school, and once enrolled, less likely to advance. Adults with spinal cord injury face similar barriers to economic participation, with a global unemployment rate of more than 60%.Existing data do not allow for global cost estimates of spinal cord injury, but they do offer a general picture.The level and severity of the injury have an important influence on costs--injuries higher up on the spinal cord (e.g. tetraplegia vs. paraplegia) incur higher costs.Direct costs are highest in the first year after spinal cord injury onset and then decrease significantly over time.Indirect costs, in particular lost earnings, often exceed direct costs.Much of the cost is borne by people with spinal cord injury.Costs of spinal cord injury are higher than those of comparable conditions such as dementia, multiple sclerosis and cerebral palsy.\n",

Management of bladder and bowel function is of primary importance.Access to appropriate assistive devices that can enable people to perform everyday activities they would not otherwise be able to undertake, reducing functional limitations and dependency. Only 5-15% of people in low- and middle-income countries have access to the assistive devices they need.Specialized knowledge and skills among providers of medical care and rehabilitation services.Essential measures to secure the right to education and economic participation include legislation, policy and programmes that promote the following:physically accessible homes, schools, workplaces, hospitals and transportation;inclusive education;elimination of discrimination in employment and educational settings;Vocational rehabilitation to optimize the chance of employment;micro-finance and other forms of self-employment benefits to support alternative forms of economic self-sufficiency;access to social support payments that do not act as disincentive to return to work; andcorrect understanding of spinal cord injury and positive attitudes towards people living with it.\n",

      "The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) defines disability as an umbrella term for impairments, activity limitations and participation restrictions. Disability is the interaction between individuals with a health condition (e.g. cerebral palsy, Down syndrome and depression) and personal and environmental factors (e.g. negative attitudes, inaccessible transportation and public buildings, and limited social supports).Over a billion people are estimated to live with some form of disability. This corresponds to about 15% of the world's population. Between 110 million (2.2%) and 190 million (3.8%) people 15 years and older have significant difficulties in functioning. Furthermore, the rates of disability are increasing in part due to ageing populations and an increase in chronic health conditions.Disability is extremely diverse. While some health conditions associated with disability result in poor health and extensive health care needs, others do not. However all people with disabilities have the same general health care needs as everyone else, and therefore need access to mainstream health care services. Article 25 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) reinforces the right of persons with disabilities to attain the highest standard of health care, without discrimination.\n",

Examples include pressure ulcers, urinary tract infections, osteoporosis and pain.Co-morbid conditionsCo-morbid conditions occur in addition to (and are unrelated to) a primary health condition associated with disability. For example the prevalence of diabetes in people with schizophrenia is around 15% compared to a rate of 2-3% for the general population.Age-related conditionsThe ageing process for some groups of people with disabilities begins earlier than usual. For example some people with developmental disabilities show signs of premature ageing in their 40s and 50s.Engaging in health risk behavioursSome studies have indicated that people with disabilities have higher rates of risky behaviours such as smoking, poor diet and physical inactivity.Higher rates of premature deathMortality rates for people with disabilities vary depending on the health condition.

For example, research in Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu states of India found that after the cost, the lack of services in the area was the second most significant barrier to using health facilities.Physical barriersUneven access to buildings (hospitals, health centres), inaccessible medical equipment, poor signage, narrow doorways, internal steps, inadequate bathroom facilities, and inaccessible parking areas create barriers to health care facilities. For example, women with mobility difficulties are often unable to access breast and cervical cancer screening because examination tables are not height-adjustable and mammography equipment only accommodates women who are able to stand.Inadequate skills and knowledge of health workersPeople with disabilities were more than twice as likely to report finding health care provider skills inadequate to meet their needs, four times more likely to report being treated badly and nearly three times more likely to report being denied care.Addressing barriers to health careGovernments can improve health outcomes for people with disabilities by improving access to quality, affordable health care services, which make the best use of available resources. As several factors interact to inhibit access to health care, reforms in all the interacting components of the health care system are required.Policy and legislationAssess existing policies and services, identify priorities to reduce health inequalities and plan improvements for access and inclusion. Make changes to comply with the CRPD. Establish health care standards related to care of persons with disabilities with enforcement mechanisms.FinancingWhere private health insurance dominates health care financing, ensure that people with disabilities are covered and consider measures to make the premiums affordable. Ensure that people with disabilities benefit equally from public health care programmes. Use financial incentives to encourage health-care providers to make services accessible and provide comprehensive assessments, treatment, and follow-ups. Consider options for reducing or removing out-of-pocket payments for people with disabilities who do not have other means of financing health care services.Service deliveryProvide a broad range of modifications and adjustments (reasonable accommodation) to facilitate access to health care services. For example changing the physical layout of clinics to provide access for people with mobility difficulties or communicating health information in accessible formats such as Braille. Empower people with disabilities to maximize their health by providing information, training, and peer support. Promote community-based rehabilitation (CBR) to facilitate access for disabled people to existing services. Identify groups that require alternative service delivery models, for example, targeted services or care coordination to improve access to health care.Human resourcesIntegrate disability education into undergraduate and continuing education for all health-care professionals. Train community workers so that they can play a role in preventive health care services. Provide evidence-based guidelines for assessment and treatment.Data and researchInclude people with disabilities in health care surveillance. Conduct more research on the needs, barriers, and health outcomes for people with disabilities.\n",

      "\n",
      "Hearing loss is defined as hearing at thresholds greater than 20dB in the better ear while deafness is hearing at thresholds above 95dB on both ears. Hearing loss greater than 35 decibels (dB) in the better-hearing ear is referred to as disabling hearing loss.  Hearing loss; measured in decibels, could classified as mild, moderate, moderately severe, severe or profound. This could affect one ear or both ears. Hearing thresholds of 25dB or better in one ear and greater than 35dB in the other ear are termed unilateral hearing loss. Hearing loss results in difficulties engaging in conversational speech or even hearing loud sounds.People with hearing loss ranging from mild to severe are referred to as Hard of hearing. They can communicate using spoken language but may benefit from hearing aids, cochlear implants, and other assistive devices as well as captioning. Deaf people have very minimal or no hearing at all. They rely on sign language, assistive listening technology and captioning to communicate.  Grading of hearing loss and functional consequence of each grade (From World Report on HearingRegional situationHearing loss is on the rise globally. Up to 80% of people with hearing loss live in low- and middle-income countries. In 2023, estimates showed that there are 40 million people Africa with hearing loss. This projected to rise to 54 million people in 2030 and 97 million people with hearing loss in 2050.  Hearing loss may occur at any point across the life course of an individual. Some causes of hearing loss tend to affect individuals at a certain stage in their life course beginning from the prenatal period, perinatal period, childhood, and adolescence or even in adulthood and older age. However, some factors causing hearing loss may occur at any stage across the life course. Up to 60% of causes of hearing loss and deafness are preventable using simple public health interventions at the community level.The key challenges to curbing the rise in the prevalence of hearing loss is lack of health system capacity for provision of integrated ear and hearing care (EHC) across the life course, and societal misperceptions and stigmatizing mindsets that influence care seeking causing those affected to either not seek treatment at all, to seek traditional treatment which usually causes more harm or to not utilise recommended treatment options such as hearing aids due to stigma. The impact of hearing loss is far reaching. At an individual level, unaddressed hearing loss negatively impacts  communication and speech development, academic achievements and prospects of gainful employment, causes social isolation and stigma as well as overall quality of life of living with disability. Failing to address hearing loss costs African economies USD27.1 billion mainly due to loss of productivity and social isolation attributed to unaddressed hearing loss.  \n",

      "Overall, it is suggested that half of all cases of hearing loss can be prevented through public health measures.In children under 15 years of age, 60% of hearing loss is attributable to preventable causes. This figure is higher in low- and middle-income countries (75%) as compared to high-income countries (49%). Overall, preventable causes of childhood hearing loss include:Infections such as mumps, measles, rubella, meningitis, cytomegalovirus infections, and chronic otitis media (31%).Complications at the time of birth, such as birth asphyxia, low birth weight, prematurity, and jaundice (17%).Use of ototoxic medicines in expecting mothers and babies (4%).Others (8%)Some simple strategies for prevention of hearing loss include:immunizing children against childhood diseases, including measles, meningitis, rubella and mumps;immunizing adolescent girls and women of reproductive age against rubella before pregnancy;preventing cytomegalovirus infections in expectant mothers through good hygiene; screening for and treating syphilis and other infections in pregnant women;strengthening maternal and child health programmes, including promotion of safe childbirth;following healthy ear care practices;screening of children for otitis media, followed by appropriate medical or surgical interventions;avoiding the use of particular drugs which may be harmful to hearing, unless prescribed and monitored by a qualified physician;referring infants at high risk, such as those with a family history of deafness or those born with low birth weight, birth asphyxia, jaundice or meningitis, for early assessment of hearing, to ensure prompt diagnosis and appropriate management, as required;reducing exposure (both occupational and recreational) to loud sounds by raising awareness about the risks; developing and enforcing relevant legislation; and encouraging individuals to use personal protective devices such as earplugs and noise-cancelling earphones and headphones.How can we address the problem?Over 70% of causes of hearing loss in Africa are preventable through simple and cost-effective evidence based public health measures. IP-EHC should be integrated into the primary health care system and primary healthcare workers be empowered to make diagnosis and treat ear and hearing disorders as part of continuum of care for other conditions, so no one is left behind. Implementation of H.E.A.R.I.N.G interventions Hearing screening and interventionEar disease prevention and managementAccess to technologiesRehabilitation servicesImproved communicationNoise reductionGreater community engagement \n",

      "Early detection and intervention are crucial to minimizing the impact of hearing loss on a child’s development and educational achievements. In infants and young children with hearing loss, early identification and management through infant hearing screening programmes can improve the linguistic and educational outcomes for the child. Children with deafness should be given the opportunity to learn sign language along with their families.Pre-school, school and occupational screening for ear diseases and hearing loss is an effective tool for early identification and management of hearing loss.People with hearing loss can benefit from the use of hearing devices, such as hearing aids, cochlear implants, and other assistive devices. They may also benefit from speech therapy, aural rehabilitation and other related services. However, global production of hearing aids meets less than 10% of global need and less than 3% of developing countries’ needs. The lack of availability of services for fitting and maintaining these devices, and the lack of batteries are also barriers in many low-income settings.Making properly-fitted, affordable hearing aids and cochlear implants and providing accessible follow-up services in all parts of the world will benefit many people with hearing loss.People who develop hearing loss can learn to communicate through development of lip-reading skills, use of written or printed text, and sign language. Teaching in sign language will benefit children with hearing loss, while provision of captioning and sign language interpretation on television will facilitate access to information.Officially recognizing national sign languages and increasing the availability of sign language interpreters are important actions to improve access to sign language services. Encouraging organizations of people with hearing loss, parents and family support groups; and strengthening human rights legislation can also help ensure better inclusion for people with hearing loss.\n",

The seal is formed by cutting and repositioning the labia minora, or labia majora, sometimes through stitching, with or without removal of the clitoris (clitoridectomy).Type 4: This includes all other harmful procedures to the female genitalia for non-medical purposes, e.g. pricking, piercing, incising, scraping and cauterizing the genital area.Deinfibulation refers to the practice of cutting open the sealed vaginal opening in a woman who has been infibulated, which is often necessary for improving health and well-being as well as to allow intercourse or to facilitate childbirth.\n",

Sometimes genital tissue is stitched again several times, including after childbirth, hence the woman goes through repeated opening and closing procedures, further increasing both immediate and long-term risks;psychological problems (depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, low self-esteem, etc.);health complications of female genital mutilation.Health complications of female genital mutilation\n",

      "\n",
      "The reasons why female genital mutilations are performed vary from one region to another as well as over time, and include a mix of sociocultural factors within families and communities. The most commonly cited reasons are:Where FGM is a social convention (social norm), the social pressure to conform to what others do and have been doing, as well as the need to be accepted socially and the fear of being rejected by the community, are strong motivations to perpetuate the practice. In some communities, FGM is almost universally performed and unquestioned.FGM is often considered a necessary part of raising a girl, and a way to prepare her for adulthood and marriage.FGM is often motivated by beliefs about what is considered acceptable sexual behaviour. It aims to ensure premarital virginity and marital fidelity. FGM is in many communities believed to reduce a woman's libido and therefore believed to help her resist extramarital sexual acts. When a vaginal opening is covered or narrowed (type 3), the fear of the pain of opening it, and the fear that this will be found out, is expected to further discourage extramarital sexual intercourse among women with this type of FGM.Where it is believed that being cut increases marriageability, FGM is more likely to be carried out.FGM is associated with cultural ideals of femininity and modesty, which include the notion that girls are clean and beautiful after removal of body parts that are considered unclean, unfeminine or male.Though no religious scripts prescribe the practice, practitioners often believe the practice has religious support.Religious leaders take varying positions with regard to FGM: some promote it, some consider it irrelevant to religion, and others contribute to its elimination.Local structures of power and authority, such as community leaders, religious leaders, circumcisers, and even some medical personnel can contribute to upholding the practice.In most societies, where FGM is practised, it is considered a cultural tradition, which is often used as an argument for its continuation.In some societies, recent adoption of the practice is linked to copying the traditions of neighbouring groups. Sometimes it has started as part of a wider religious or traditional revival movement.\n",

      "Building on work from previous decades, in 1997, WHO issued a joint statement against the practice of FGM together with the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA).Since 1997, great efforts have been made to counteract FGM, through research, work within communities, and changes in public policy. Progress at international, national and sub-national levels includes:wider international involvement to stop FGM;international monitoring bodies and resolutions that condemn the practice;revised legal frameworks and growing political support to end FGM (this includes a law against FGM in 26 countries in Africa and the Middle East, as well as in 33 other countries with migrant populations from FGM practicing countries);the prevalence of FGM has decreased in most countries and an increasing number of women and men in practising communities support ending its practice.Research shows that, if practicing communities themselves decide to abandon FGM, the practice can be eliminated very rapidly.In 2007, UNFPA and UNICEF initiated the Joint Programme on Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting to accelerate the abandonment of the practice.In 2008, WHO together with 9 other United Nations partners, issued a statement on the elimination of FGM to support increased advocacy for its abandonment, called: “Eliminating female genital mutilation: an interagency statement”. This statement provided evidence collected over the previous decade about the practice of FGM.In 2010, WHO published a \"Global strategy to stop health care providers from performing female genital mutilation\" in collaboration with other key UN agencies and international organizations.In December 2012, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution on the elimination of female genital mutilation.Building on a previous report from 2013, in 2016 UNICEF launched an updated report documenting the prevalence of FGM in 30 countries, as well as beliefs, attitudes, trends, and programmatic and policy responses to the practice globally.In May 2016, WHO in collaboration with the UNFPA-UNICEF joint programme on FGM launched the first evidence-based guidelines on the management of health complications from FGM. The guidelines were developed based on a systematic review of the best available evidence on health interventions for women living with FGM.To ensure the effective implementation of the guidelines, WHO is developing tools for front-line health-care workers to improve knowledge, attitudes, and skills of health care providers in preventing and managing the complications of FGM.\n",

      "Female genital mutilation has no known health benefits. On the contrary, it is known to be harmful to girls and women in many ways. First and foremost, it is painful and traumatic. The removal of or damage to healthy, normal genital tissue interferes with the natural functioning of the body and can cause several immediate and long-term health consequences. For example, FGM can cause excessive bleeding, swelling of genital tissue and problems urinating, and severe infections that can lead to shock and in some cases, death, as well as complications in childbirth and increased risk of perinatal deaths.Communities that practice female genital mutilation report a variety of sociocultural reasons for continuing with it. Seen from a human rights perspective, the practice reflects deep-rooted inequality between the sexes, and constitutes an extreme form of discrimination against women.Female genital mutilation is nearly always carried out on minors and is therefore a violation of the rights of the child. The practice also violates the rights to health, security and physical integrity of the person, the right to be free from torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, and the right to life when the procedure results in death.Female genital mutilation comprises all procedures involving partial or total removal of the external female genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons (WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, 1997).The WHO/UNICEF/UNFPA Joint Statement classified female genital mutilation into four types. Experience with using this classification over the past decade has revealed the need to sub-divide these categories to capture more closely the variety of procedures.Although the extent of genital tissue cutting generally increases from Type I to III, there are exceptions. Severity and risk are closely related to the anatomical extent of the cutting, including both the type of FGM performed and the amount of tissue that is cut, which may vary between the types.Type IV comprises a variety of practices that do not involve removal of tissue from the genitals. Though limited research has been carried out on Type IV FGM, in general, these forms appear to be less associated with harm or risk than the types I, II and III, that all involve removal of genital tissue.The complete typology with sub-divisions is described below:Type I — Partial or total removal of the clitoris and/or the prepuce (clitoridectomy). When it is important to distinguish between the major variations of Type I mutilation, the following subdivisions are proposed:Type Ia, removal of the clitoral hood or prepuce only;Type Ib, removal of the clitoris with the prepuce.Type II — Partial or total removal of the clitoris and the labia minora, with or without excision of the labia majora (excision). When it is important to distinguish between the major variations that have been documented, the following subdivisions are proposed:Type IIa, removal of the labia minora only;Type IIb, partial or total removal of the clitoris and the labia minora;Type IIc, partial or total removal of the clitoris, the labia minora and the labia majora.Type III — Narrowing of the vaginal orifice with creation of a covering seal by cutting and appositioning the labia minora and/or the labia majora, with or without excision of the clitoris (infibulation). When it is important to distinguish between variations in infibulations, the following subdivisions are proposed:Type IIIa, removal and apposition of the labia minora;Type IIIb, removal and apposition of the labia majora.Type IV — All other harmful procedures to the female genitalia for non-medical purposes, for example: pricking, piercing, incising, scraping and cauterization.\n",

      "              \n",
      "\n",
      "First ever estimates of the global burden of foodborne diseases show almost 1 in 10 people fall ill every year from eating contaminated food and 420 000 die as a result- Children under 5 years of age are at particularly high risk, with 125 000 children dying from foodborne diseases every year- WHO African and South-East Asia Regions have the highest burden of foodborne diseasesNews release3 DECEMBER 2015 | GENEVA - Almost one third (30%) of all deaths from foodborne diseases are in children under the age of 5 years, despite the fact that they make up only 9% of the global population. This is among the findings of WHO's \"Estimates of the global burden of foodborne diseases\" – the most comprehensive report to date on the impact of contaminated food on health and well-being.The report, which estimates the burden of foodborne diseases caused by 31 agents – bacteria, viruses, parasites, toxins and chemicals – states that each year as many as 600 million, or almost 1 in 10 people in the world, fall ill after consuming contaminated food. Of these, 420 000 people die, including 125 000 children under the age of 5 years.“Until now, estimates of foodborne diseases were vague and imprecise. This concealed the true human costs of contaminated food. This report sets the record straight,” says Dr Margaret Chan, Director-General of WHO. “Knowing which foodborne pathogens are causing the biggest problems in which parts of the world can generate targeted action by the public, governments, and the food industry.”While the burden of foodborne diseases is a public health concern globally, the WHO African and South-East Asia Regions have the highest incidence and highest death rates, including among children under the age of 5 years.“These estimates are the result of a decade of work, including input from more than 100 experts from around the world. They are conservative, and more needs to be done to improve the availability of data on the burden of foodborne diseases. But based on what we know now, it is apparent that the global burden of foodborne diseases is considerable, affecting people all over the world – particularly children under 5 years of age and people in low-income areas,” says Dr Kazuaki Miyagishima, Director of WHO’s Department of Food Safety and Zoonoses.Diarrhoeal diseases are responsible for more than half of the global burden of foodborne diseases, causing 550 million people to fall ill and 230 000 deaths every year. Children are at particular risk of foodborne diarrhoeal diseases, with 220 million falling ill and 96 000 dying every year. Diarrhoea is often caused by eating raw or undercooked meat, eggs, fresh produce and dairy products contaminated by norovirus, Campylobacter, non-typhoidal Salmonella and pathogenic E. coli.Other major contributors to the global burden of foodborne diseases are typhoid fever, hepatitis A, Taenia solium (a tapeworm), and aflatoxin (produced by mould on grain that is stored inappropriately).Certain diseases, such as those caused by non-typhoidal Salmonella, are a public health concern across all regions of the world, in high- and low-income countries alike. Other diseases, such as typhoid fever, foodborne cholera, and those caused by pathogenic E. coli, are much more common to low-income countries, while Campylobacter is an important pathogen in high-income countries.The risk of foodborne diseases is most severe in low- and middle-income countries, linked to preparing food with unsafe water; poor hygiene and inadequate conditions in food production and storage; lower levels of literacy and education; and insufficient food safety legislation or implementation of such legislation.Foodborne diseases can cause short-term symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea (commonly referred to as food poisoning), but can also cause longer-term illnesses, such as cancer, kidney or liver failure, brain and neural disorders. These diseases may be more serious in children, pregnant women, and those who are older or have a weakened immune system. Children who survive some of the more serious foodborne diseases may suffer from delayed physical and mental development, impacting their quality of life permanently.Food safety is a shared responsibility, says WHO. The report’s findings underscore the global threat posed by foodborne diseases and reinforce the need for governments, the food industry and individuals to do more to make food safe and prevent foodborne diseases. There remains a significant need for education and training on the prevention of foodborne diseases among food producers, suppliers, handlers and the general public. WHO is working closely with national governments to help set and implement food safety strategies and policies that will in turn have a positive impact on the safety of food in the global marketplace.\n",

      "              \n",
      "\n",
      "Consuming unsafe foods pose a significant public health threat in the African Region. Infants, young children, pregnant women, the elderly and those with underlying illnesses are particularly vulnerable.Food and water containing harmful bacteria, viruses, parasites or chemical substances are responsible for more than 200 diseases, ranging from diarrhoea to cancers. Meats, seafood, cooked rice, cooked pasta, milk, cheese and eggs are common types of food that can become unsafe very fast.On the 7th of April 2015, the World Health Organization will dedicate World Health Day to the issue of food safety with theme of “From farm to plate, make food safe”. This provides an opportunity to educate consumers and alert governments, manufacturers and retailers about the importance of food safety and the part actors in the food chain, from farm to plate, can play in ensuring that food is safe to eat.The most common symptoms of foodborne illnesses include stomach pain, vomiting and diarrhoea. Symptoms may occur very quickly after eating the food, or may take days or even weeks to appear. For most foodborne illnesses, symptoms occur 24-72 hours after the food has been eaten.The smell, taste and appearance of food and water are not good indicators for determining whether they will make you sick. Just because something looks safe to eat does not mean that it is. It takes over 2.5 billion bacteria or germs to make 250 ml of water look cloudy, but in some cases it only takes 15-20 bacteria to make one sick. Similarly, the accumulation of invisible germs on one’s hands is a common source of transmission that is often overlooked.This highlights the urgent need to wash one’s hands before and after handling food and after going to the toilet. If a food handler is infected with a virus and continues to prepare food, this virus may be passed on to the consumer via the food.Unfortunately though, many people do not wash their hands properly. When washing hands, pay special attention to finger tips, fingernails, thumbs, wrists and in between fingers. While washing with soap and water is ideal, many people who do not have access to soap or detergent can use coal ash as a substitute.Also, it is important to not handle or prepare food if you are experiencing symptoms of a foodborne disease. If this cannot be avoided, wash your hands with soap and water first and frequently during food preparation. Keeping your hands clean is the first in the five keys to safer food developed by WHO to highlight the most important ways to make food safe.New food handling practices have evolved as a result of our increasingly globalized world. A longer food chain, changes in technology, and antimicrobial resistance all increase the risk of foods becoming contaminated.Although, antimicrobials, such as antibiotics, are essential to treat infections caused by bacteria, their overuse and misuse has been linked to the emergence and spread of resistant bacteria, rendering the treatment of infectious diseases ineffective. As a result, antimicrobial resistance is increasingly becoming a bigger threat to the effectiveness of modern medicine.Unsafe food has put major strains on health systems and has hurt national economies, development and international trade in the African Region. Much work has been done by WHO in the past to prevent these consequences from happening.WHO will continue to support governments to make food safety a higher public health priority to address these challenges through improving prevention, detection and response to health threats associated with unsafe food.___________________________________For more information, please contact:Technical contact:Dr Mohamed Sheriff; Tel: +472 413 9943; Email: sheriffm@who.intMedia contacts:Dr Cory Couillard; Tel: + 472 413 9995; Email: couillardc@who.intMr Collins Boakye-Agyemang; Tel: + 472 413 9420; Email: boakyeagyemangc@who.int\n",

      "              \n",
      "\n",
      "Ministers of Health of guinea worm disease-affected countries have reiterated their commitment to breaking transmission of the disease by the end of 2015.  From 1 January to 30 April 2015, only three confirmed cases have been reported to WHO.  The four endemic countries reported a total of 126 confirmed cases in 2014: Chad (13 cases), Ethiopia (3), Mali (40) and South Sudan (70).Addressing the sub-session on eradicating guinea worm and getting to zero transmission in 2015, Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa congratulated all countries for the significant progress made in eliminating guinea worm disease.  These efforts have underscored WHO’s commitment to break the transmission and get to zero cases.  Dr Moeti also welcomed and acknowledged the presence of the last patient from Ghana who was infected with guinea worm disease, Ms Azaratu Zakaria Yakubu.  Indeed, this is a practical example of the possibility of total eradication of the disease.According to Ms Azaratu Zakaria Yakubu, guinea worm disease changed her livelihood.  She was in constant pain and could not go out of the house.  Her children dropped out of school because she could not work to pay for their school fees.Reported cases of guinea worm disease reduced from 3.5 million per year in 1986 to 126 in 2014.  Reduction of the annual incidence of the disease was by more than 99.99% in the region.  Since the certification of the first three countries in 1998, the number of countries of the Region declared free of local transmission of guinea worm has increased to seven countries at the beginning of 2004 and to 40 in the beginning of January 2015.According to Dr Moeti, transmission can be interrupted because between January and April 2015, there were only three cases reported which all come from chad as compared to 11 cases during the same period in 2014.In a separate time with the media event, Ministers were interviewed about their lessons and commitment to the eradication of guinea worm disease.  Speaking to the media, Dr Makur Kariom, the undersecretary, Ministry of Health, Republic of South Sudan, echoed that the progress made in the fight against guinea worm disease was as a result of good leadership and combined efforts of all the team on the ground, WHO and that of all partners.One of the major achievements is in South Sudan which, despite the recent civil unrest, has maintained zero transmission since November 2014.  From January to March 2015, South Sudan has investigated 2994 rumours. A total of 39 specimens sent for laboratory analysis have tested negative for guinea worm (dracunculus medinensis).  WHO donated 12 vehicles and 288 bicycles to the South Sudan Ministry of Health in April 2015.  One of the vehicles and 75 of the bicycles have been added to the national programme’s existing fleet.In another interviewee, Mr Hassan Nguiadoum, State Secretary of Health, Republic of Chad, stressed the importance for dog owners to keep their animals off the street and public places if infected with guinea worm because these dogs could start the transmission process.  WHO and its partners are working closely with the national eradication programme in Chad and several measures are being implemented to interrupt transmission of the disease, including in the canine population. Besides the four endemic countries, a further three countries require certification from WHO in the African Region: Kenya (in the pre-certification stage) and Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo (which need verification to confirm zero indigenous cases).The WHO Roadmap on neglected tropical diseases targets global interruption of guinea worm transmission by the end of 2015. If this is achieved, it will take the world another 3 years of heightened surveillance to ensure total elimination.  These efforts to accelerate the elimination of the disease need the continued support and involvement of endemic countries, donor community, drug companies, and partners.________________________________________________________For more information, please contact:Technical contact:Dr Benido Impouma; Tel: +472 413 9773; Email: impoumab@who.intMedia contact:Mr Winfred Oppong-Amoako, NTD Communication; Tel: + 472 413 9811; Email: oppongamoakow@who.int\n",

Countries with the support of development agencies are making efforts in using the global health initiatives as opportunities for strengthening their national health systems. To date, out of 36 eligible countries in the African Region, 22 countries have had their proposals for HSS approved to a total amount of US$ 309,824,995.The Global Fund granted funds to twelve countries to strengthen their national health information systems for a total amount of US $ 230,857,867 for phase one upper ceiling 2 years.In 2007, a Rapid Assessment of DHS was conducted in 21 countries to determine their capacity to scale up essential health interventions. The results indicated that despite the relatively low level of inputs most countries managed to offer the essential health services at all levels of care, albeit with debatable levels quality and equity.A Framework for scaling up essential health interventions to reach the health related MDGs was developed by an interdivisional team to guide AFRO work in supporting countries in an integrated approach.During RC 59, four countries namely Burkina Faso, Ghana, Rwanda and Uganda shared best practices in strengthening DHS.

Over 600 participants from the 46 Member States of the African Region and outside Africa attended the Conference. Two documents AFR/PHC/08/1 (Discussion Paper) and AFR/PHC/08/2 (Summaries of Country Experiences on Primary Health Care Revitalization) were produced and shared among participants.Member States shared their and they strongly endorsed the values and principles of PHC. The Conference adopted the \"Ouagadougou Declaration on Primary Health Care and Health Systems in Africa: Achieving Better Health for Africa in the New Millennium\". This Declaration was endorsed by the 58th Regional Committee which also adopted the related Resolution AFR/RC58/R3. A generic Framework for the implementation of this Declaration has been prepared building on the priority areas highlighted in the Declaration as well as other policies and goals related to health development.Within the context of implementing the Declaration four countries (Angola, Equatorial Guinea, Mozambique and Nigeria) started the process of revitalization of PHC including community based health services. Ten countries strengthened capacities of their district health systems in areas such as planning, management, integration of activities, supervision, and monitoring and evaluation. Congo, Ethiopia and Mauritania developed tools and or reviewed their essential health packages to concentrate scarce resources on high impact interventions. Niger developed a strategy on quality assurance. Madagascar undertook District Health Systems Rapid assessment. This brings to 25, the number of countries that undertaken a rapid assessment of the operationality of the district health system in the past three years.The Regional Office continued to provide support to Member States to revise or develop their national health policy and health strategic plans. Eritrea and Malawi developed their National Health Policy bringing the total of countries that have developed their with national health policies in the past five years to 19. Benin, Swaziland developed their health strategic plan (HSP), making a total of 22 countries in the past 5 years while Comoros, Eritrea, Namibia and Senegal are in the process of revising their HSP.Ghana, Madagascar and Uganda organized their annual joint health sector review. Comoros has developed their Public Health Code. Benin and Democratic Republic of Congo undertook an organizational audit of their Ministry of Health. Uganda finalized its stakeholder mapping and developed and costed a scale up plan. Ghana strengthened partners' coordination. By the end of 2007, Kenya, Malawi, Uganda and Zambia had already reviewed and revised their health sector management structures.On policy formulation, the Regional Office continued to provide technical support to countries. To date 44 national health policies have been developed/revised based on the AFRO guidelines. This represents an increase of 35% in the past 4 years. The process of developing these NHP is improving through a more inclusive approach involving all relevant stockholders active in health development.

Existing evidence provides us with clear guidance on what to invest in, how much to invest, and what can be achieved with this level of investment.This document brings this information together to present the case for Investing in Health for Africa: the case for strengthening systems for better health outcomes. It has been prepared by the Harmonization for Health in Africa (HHA) group, working in close collaboration with The Partnership for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health;National Ministries of Health on the continent, and focuses on countries of Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).4 It is also based on a recognition that this investment case needs to support the ongoing work within the health sectors already underway in individual countries.\n",

      "Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) encompass 17 viral, bacterial and parasitic diseases that occur solely, or principally in tropical regions. They are often termed ‘neglected’ as the people who are most affected are the poorest populations living in rural areas, urban slums and conflict zones.Nearly half  of the burden of NTDs is believed to occur in the African Region. These diseases lead to disabilities, cause discrimination within communities, and promote the ongoing cycle of poverty.Guinea-worm disease (GWD), buruli ulcer (BU) and Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) affect only or mainly the African continent. All 47 countries in the African Region are endemic for at least one NTD and 37 of them (79%) are co-endemic for at least five of these diseases. The total population at risk of NTDs responsive to preventive chemotherapy ranges from about 123 million for onchocerciasis to about 470 million for lymphatic filariasis.Elimination of NTDsProgress is being made in delivering interventions to control NTDs. Guinea-worm disease is now close to eradication. All countries of the African Region have achieved the elimination of leprosy as a public health problem. In some countries, interventions to reduce the burden of onchocerciasis have resulted in elimination of the disease in some communities.These successes are the rationale for shifting the onchocerciasis post-2015 goal from control to elimination. In addition, the capacity of national NTD programmes is being strengthened. 36 countries in the Region have developed integrated national multi-year plans (also called NTD Master Plans) that provide a sound foundation for improved programme performance and effectiveness.The momentum to eliminate NTDs in the African Region is growing. Major political commitments to address NTDs include World Health Assembly resolutions; the Regional Committee resolution on NTDs in 2009; the Global NTD Roadmap, the London Declaration on NTDs and the Accra Urgent Call to Action on NTDs, all in 2012. As a follow-up to these commitments, the regional consultative meeting on NTDs held in Brazzaville in March 2013 recommended the WHO Regional Committee adopt a resolution on the NTDs regional strategic plan.The Regional Strategic Plan on Neglected Tropical Diseases in the African Region 2014–2020 was developed in this context and is the result of extensive consultations with representatives of Member States and other NTD stakeholders.Regional Strategic PlanWith the vision of “an African Region free of Neglected Tropical Diseases,” the Regional Strategic Plan for NTDs pursues the goal of accelerating the reduction of the disease burden by controlling, eliminating and eradicating targeted NTDs in the African Region.The 2020 targets are:to eradicate guinea-worm disease and yaws in all countries of the Region;to sustain elimination of leprosy and further reduce severe leprosy disabilities;to eliminate lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, schistosomiasis and blinding trachoma;to control morbidity due to Buruli ulcer, human African trypanosomiasis, leishmaniasis, soil-transmitted helminthiasis and rabies in the Region;to prevent disabilities due to Buruli ulcer, leishmaniasis, leprosy, lymphatic filariasis and blinding trachoma.The Regional Strategic Plan for NTDs envisions four objectives:Scale up access to interventions and system capacity building;Enhance planning for results, resource mobilization and financial sustainability of national NTD programmes;Strengthen advocacy, coordination and national ownership; andEnhance monitoring, evaluation, surveillance and research.Way forwardFor each objective, the Regional Strategic Plan defines actions to be carried out by Member States, WHO Secretariat and partners. The actions constitute the backbone of the Strategic Plan.Member States will establish national NTD programmes and coordination mechanisms; enhance planning; strengthen advocacy and sustained resource mobilization; coordinate interventions for preventive chemotherapy, case management and transmission control; and conduct monitoring and evaluation.The WHO Secretariat’s actions include convening and coordination; policy advice and guidance; technical assistance and capacity building; support for supplies, mainly for medicines, lab tests and reagents; support for monitoring, evaluation, surveillance and research as well as sharing best practices.Actions for partners focus on support to countries; collaboration with the WHO Secretariat; mobilization of resources; funding; and contribution to in-country supply of commodities.\n",

      "Dying from viral hepatitis in Africa is becoming a bigger threat than dying from HIV/AIDS, malaria or tuberculosis. Yet, a new analysis shows that the disease remains neglected in many parts of the continent.The epidemic of viral hepatitis B and C affects 325 million people globally and is 10 times larger than the global HIV epidemic. Every day, more than 3600 people die of viral hepatitis-related liver disease, liver failure and liver cancer.In Africa, chronic viral hepatitis affects over 70 million Africans (60 million with hepatitis B and 10 million with hepatitis C). Hepatitis B infection is preventable, treatable and hepatitis C virus infection (HCV) is now curable. Yet, despite the availability of diagnostic tools and effective treatment, over 90% of people living with hepatitis B and C in Africa lack much needed care.  The result is at least 200 000 deaths a year in Africa, often among the continent’s most youthful and productive population. Fewer than 1 in 10 people in Africa have access to testing and treatment, so the disease often progresses to advanced liver disease with its associated catastrophic financial burden as well as emotional distress and stigmatization.With adequate resources and strong political commitment, this disease can be eliminated by 2030.\n",

      "\n",
      "Hepatitis BThe hepatitis B virus is transmitted through parenteral and percutaneous contact with the blood or other body fluids of an infected person.In highly endemic areas, hepatitis B is most commonly spread from mother to child at birth (perinatal transmission), or through horizontal transmission (exposure to infected blood), especially from an infected child to an uninfected child during the first 5 years of life. The development of chronic infection is very common in infants infected from their mothers or before the age of 5 years.Transmission of the virus may also occur through the reuse of contaminated or poorly sterilized needles and syringes either in health-care settings or among persons who inject drugs. In addition, infection can occur during medical, surgical and dental procedures, through tattooing, or through the use of razors and similar objects that are contaminated with infected blood.Sexual transmission of hepatitis B may occur, particularly in unvaccinated men who have sex with men and heterosexual persons with multiple sex partners or through contact with sex workers.The hepatitis B virus can survive outside the body for at least seven days. During this time, the virus can still cause infection if it enters the body of a person who is not protected by the vaccine. The incubation period of the hepatitis B virus is 75 days on average, but it can vary from 30 to 180 days.Initial exposure to hepatitis B virus often results in acute infection in all populations. However, the development of chronic persistent infection depends on age. Infection in infancy leads to chronic hepatitis in about 95% of cases and 40 to 60% in early childhood infections. In contrast, less than 5% of infections acquired in adulthood result in chronic infections.Hepatitis CThe hepatitis C virus is a bloodborne virus and WHO estimates that in 2015, there were 1.75 million new HCV infections in the world (23.7 new HCV infections per 100 000 people). The most common modes of infection are through parenteral exposure to blood, blood products and other body fluids.In Africa, the reuse or inadequate sterilization of medical equipment especially syringes and needles in health-care settings and the transfusion of unscreened blood and blood products (especially in people with sickle cell disease who receive multiple blood transfusions) are the commonest routes of transmission.Sexual practices such as having multiple sexual partners and men who have sex with men are important routes of transmission especially in immunosuppressed populations like people living with HIV.Intravenous drug use is recognized as the most prominent route of transmission in Europe and the USA and has become an emerging concern for hepatitis C transmission in Africa.HCV can be passed from an infected mother to her baby; however, these modes of transmission are less common except in pregnant women who are also injecting drug users.Hepatitis C, like hepatitis B is not spread through breast milk, food, water or casual contact such as hugging, kissing and sharing food or drinks with an infected person.\n",

      "It is not possible, on clinical grounds, to differentiate viral hepatitis from hepatitis caused by other viral agents; hence, laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis is essential. A number of blood tests are available to diagnose and monitor people with hepatitis B or C. They can be used to distinguish between acute and chronic infections. WHO recommends that all blood donations be tested for hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV to ensure blood safety and avoid accidental transmission to people who receive blood products.Hepatitis BLaboratory diagnosis of hepatitis B infection focuses on the detection of the various hepatitis B antigens (hepatitis B surface antigen, HBsAg and hepatitis B e antigen, HBeAg) and antibodies (mainly antibodies to HBcAg). The presence of HBsAg identifies current infection (either acute or chronic).Acute HBV infection is characterized by the presence of HBsAg and immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody to the core antigen, HBcAg. During the initial phase of infection, patients are also seropositive for HBeAg. HBeAg is usually a marker of high levels of replication of the virus. The presence of HBeAg indicates that the blood and body fluids of the infected individual are highly infectious.Chronic infection is characterized by the persistence of HBsAg for at least 6 months (with or without concurrent HBeAg). Persistence of HBsAg is the principal marker of risk for developing chronic liver disease and liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma) later in life.Hepatitis B DNA testing is required to evaluate disease stage and may be required for treatment and monitoring decisions.Hepatitis CIn the absence of a serologically developed HCV antigen test, HCV infection is diagnosed by identification of HCV antibody (anti-HCV) developed by the body in response to HCV infection. This serological test identifies all persons who have been exposed to HCV infection and is unable to distinguish current infections from resolved infection.In all persons who test positive for anti-HCV antibodies, a nucleic acid test for HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) is needed to confirm chronic infection because about 30% of people infected with HCV spontaneously clear the infection by a strong immune response without the need for treatment. Although no longer infected, they will still test positive for anti-HCV antibodies.\n",

Clinical care is aimed at maintaining comfort and adequate nutritional balance, including replacement of fluids lost from vomiting and diarrhoea. Most important is the avoidance of unnecessary medications. Acetaminophen/Paracetamol and medication against vomiting should not be given. There is no specific treatment for acute hepatitis B. However, acute hepatitis C may require specific antiviral therapy.\n",

      "All persons with chronic HBV or HCV require further assessment for the degree of liver damage (fibrosis and cirrhosis) and require biochemical testing, imaging and fibrosis assessment through a variety of non-invasive tests or liver biopsy. The degree of liver damage is used to guide management of the disease.Hepatitis BChronic hepatitis B infection can be treated with medicines, including oral antiviral agents. Treatment can slow the progression of cirrhosis, reduce incidence of liver cancer and improve long term survival. Only a proportion (estimates vary from 10% to 40% depending on setting and eligibility criteria) of people with chronic hepatitis B infection will require treatment.WHO recommends the use of oral treatments – tenofovir or entecavir – as the most potent drugs to suppress hepatitis B virus. They rarely lead to drug resistance compared with other drugs, are simple to take (1 pill a day), and have few side effects, so require only limited monitoring.Tenofovir is no longer protected by a patent anywhere in the world and multiple generic formulations exit. Additionally, it is a common drug component of HIV therapy and is widely available within HIV programmes in Africa. Paradoxically, it is often inaccessible and unaffordable to patients with HBV mono infections. The median price of WHO-prequalified generic tenofovir on the international market fell from US$ 208 per year to US$ 32 per year in 2016.Entecavir is now also off-patent. In 2017, all low- and middle-income countries could legally procure generic entecavir, but the costs and availability varied widely.Treatment is very effective and can cause long-term viral suppression. As in HIV infection, treatment is often lifelong. The need for long-term follow-up, adherence and counselling, shared diagnostic platforms and overlapping treatment requirements are important reasons for strategic collaboration to foster cross-programmatic efficiencies.There is still limited access to diagnosis and treatment of hepatitis B in many resource-constrained settings. In 2016, of the 257 million people living with HBV infection, 10.5% (27 million) were aware of their infection. Of those diagnosed, the global treatment coverage is 16.7% (4.5 million). Many people are diagnosed only when they already have advanced liver disease.Among the long-term complications of HBV infections, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma cause a large disease burden. Liver cancer progresses rapidly, and since treatment options are limited, the outcome is generally poor. In low-income settings, most people with liver cancer die within months of diagnosis. In high-income countries, surgery and chemotherapy can prolong life for up to a few years. Liver transplantation is sometimes used in people with cirrhosis in high-income countries, with varying success.Hepatitis CA new infection with HCV does not always require treatment, as the immune response in some people will clear the infection. However, when HCV infection becomes chronic, treatment is necessary. The goal of hepatitis C treatment is to cure the infection.WHO’s updated 2018 guidelines recommend therapy with pan-genotypic direct-acting antivirals (DAAs). DAAs can cure most persons with HCV infection, and treatment duration is short (usually 12 to 24 weeks), depending on the absence or presence of cirrhosis.WHO recommends treating all persons with chronic HCV infection over the age of 12 years. Pan-genotypic DAAs remain expensive in many high- and upper-middle-income countries. However, prices have dropped dramatically in many countries (primarily low-income and lower middle-income countries), due to the introduction of generic versions of these medicines.Access to HCV treatment is improving but remains too limited. In 2017, of the 71 million persons living with HCV infection globally, an estimated 19% (13.1 million) knew their diagnosis, and of those diagnosed with chronic HCV infection, around 5 million persons had been treated with DAAs by the end of 2017. Much more needs to be done for the world to achieve the 80% HCV treatment target by 2030.\n",

Most often these tests provide same-day test results, which are essential for same-day diagnosis and early treatment and care.Key populations and their sexual partners accounted for over half of all new infections (an estimated 54%) for the first time in 2018.Key populations include: men who have sex with men, people who inject drugs, people in prisons and other closed settings, sex workers and their clients, and transgender people. They are at increased risk of HIV infection irrespective of epidemic type or local context.Key populations, their clients and sexual partners accounted for 64% of new HIV infections in West and Central Africa, and for 25% of new HIV infections in the East and Southern African subregion. Key populations and their partners accounted for around 95% of new HIV infections in eastern Europe and central Asia and in the Middle East and North Africa in 2018.Key populations often face legal and social barriers that increase their vulnerability to HIV and impede their access to prevention, testing and treatment programmes.There is no cure for HIV infection. However, effective antiretroviral (ARV) drugs can control the virus and help prevent transmission so that people with HIV and those at substantial risk, can enjoy healthy, long and productive lives.It is estimated that currently 79% of people with HIV know their status. In 2018, an estimated 23.3 million people living with HIV were receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) globally.Between 2000 and 2018, new HIV infections fell by 37%, and HIV-related deaths fell by 45% with 13.6 million lives saved due to ART in the same period.

Antiretroviral therapy does not cure HIV infection but suppresses viral replication within a person's body and allows an individual's immune system to strengthen and regain the capacity to fight off infections.People with HIV can enjoy long, healthy lives by taking ARV treatment.In 2021, WHO released the Consolidated guidelines on HIV prevention, testing, treatment, service delivery and monitoring: Recommendations for a public health approach. These consolidated guidelines on preventing and treating HIV infection bring together a series of recommendations to promote the highest quality, person- centered delivery of care for people living with HIV and affected by HIVConsolidated guidelines on HIV prevention, testing, treatment, service delivery and monitoring: Recommendations for a public health approachHIV still causes too many avoidable deaths, but by providing the right health services in a timely manner, we can avoid the worst consequences of the virus. The recommendations in these guidelines aim to reduce the number of people dying from HIV and, when fully implemented, will help us to reach our goals of reducing global HIV deaths to less than 200 000 by 2030. For most people living with HIV, it is a chronic, lifelong condition. Evidence and lived experience have shown that with the right support, people are able to manage their own health according to what works best in their lives. The service delivery approaches put forward in these guidelines aim to promote self-management for the majority of people living with or affected by HIV. This includes an expanded range of options for diagnosing, preventing, and treating HIV that are delivered and monitored in the community.Treatment and care in children and adolescentsIn the African region, an estimated 1.3 million children aged 0-14 were living with HIV at the end of 2022, and 109 000 children were newly infected. An estimated 69 000 children died of AIDS-related illnesses. To reduce HIV-related mortality and morbidity among this highly vulnerable population, early testing and treatment is essential. Without access to testing and treatment, 50% of children with HIV will die by the age of 2, and 80% will not live to their fifth birthday.WHO recommends that infants born to mothers living with HIV are tested for HIV, at birth, six weeks, during breastfeeding, and when breastfeeding ends given the continued risk of transmission during this period. Older children, especially offspring and siblings of persons infected with HIV, should also be tested. HIV-positive children should be started on antiretroviral drugs (ARV) immediately. Once treatment begins, children must take their medicine regularly to stay healthy into adolescence and adulthood. Failure to suppress the HIV virus remains a serious problem among children, aggravated by a lack of child-friendly formulations of the newest and most effective ARVs designed for adults.Compared to other populations, adolescents face additional barriers in accessing testing and treatment, including health services that are not adapted to their needs and policies that require parental consent for services. HIV-positive adolescents also are less likely than adults to adhere to their treatment regularly, resulting in lower rates of viral suppression and lower declines in mortality.Addressing the distinct and diverse needs of adolescents living with HIV to improve their HIV-related outcomes requires a comprehensive and integrated approach that leverages on global commitments and approaches to adolescent health, including the Global Strategy for Women, Children, and Adolescents’ Health (2016–2030) and the Global Accelerated Action for the Health of Adolescents (AA-HA!).WHO recommends the implementation of adolescent-friendly health services in HIV services to ensure engagement and improved outcomes. Involving and engaging in their own care across the treatment cascade and through the cycle of planning, implementing, monitoring and evaluating programs is key. Peer-driven, adolescent-friendly services, integrated with other services including psychosocial interventions, are effective ways to improve health outcomes for adolescents.AIDS-free framework to accelerate paediatric and adolescent HIV treatmentHIV Drug ResistanceTens of millions of HIV/AIDS patients have had their lives saved thanks to the extraordinary rise in the use of antiretroviral medication (ART) during the last ten years. Of the estimated 25.6 million people living with HIV in the African region, 20.8 million were on antiretroviral therapy (ART) as of the end of 2022. HIV drug resistance has emerged in tandem with the growing usage of HIV medications; in recent years, the prevalence of this resistance has been progressively rising. Changes in the genetic makeup of HIV impact the medications' capacity to prevent the virus from replicating, leading to HIV drug resistance. Due to the advent of newer kinds of antiretrovirals, all currently available medications have the potential to become partially or completely inactive.Drug-resistant virus strains have the potential to render all antiretroviral medications, including those from more recent classes, partially or completely inert. HIV drug resistance has the potential to compromise antiretroviral medication effectiveness if it is not addressed, leading to a rise in HIV infections as well as higher rates of morbidity and mortality related to HIV.Guidelines on the public health response to pretreatment HIV drug resistanceWHO releases HIV drug resistance report 2021 •    WHO urges action against HIV drug resistance threatPrevention of HIV drug resistanceWHO recommends assessing whether antiretroviral therapy (ART) programmes are delivering services at the quality required, to minimize the emergence of HIV drug resistance. This assessment is achieved with a set of standard quality-of-care indicators known as “early warning indicators” of HIV drug resistance. The early warning indicators use standardized definitions, which have evolved over time as programmes mature and public health actions are refined. The most up-to-date set of early warning indicators for HIV drug resistance are included in the WHO “Consolidated HIV Strategic Information Guidelines” and the HIV Drug Resistance Strategy, 2021 update.Total attrition from ARTPeople living with HIV who have suppressed viral loadViral load testing coverage Timely second viral load testARV medicine stock-outART adherence proxy (ARV refills)Timely switch to second-line ARTConsolidated guidelines on person-centred HIV strategic information: strengthening routine data for impactHIV drug resistance strategy, 2021 update  Policy brief Policy brief on integrating and strengthening monitoring of differentiated ART service deliveryPolicy brief on digital health dataEnhancing the monitoring of HIV testing and treatmentLaboratory network for HIVDRThe WHO HIV drug resistance laboratory network supports HIV drug resistance surveys by providing accurate and timely genotyping results that meet WHO specifications.Its objectives are to ensure:the proper collection, handling, shipment and storage of specimens; andthe availability of quality-assured HIV genotyping laboratory services producing comparable and reliable results at the national, regional and global level.The national HIV drug resistance working groups that coordinate WHO-recommended surveys must use a WHO-designated genotyping laboratory to provide quality-assured testing services for drug resistance surveys.To be designated as a laboratory for WHO surveys, several mandatory criteria must be met including a site inspection and annual external proficiency testing. The roles and responsibilities of network laboratories, recommended testing, internal and external quality assurance procedures, and assay validation recommendations are summarized in the WHO/HIVResNet HIV drug resistance laboratory operational framework.Minimum criteria for external quality assurance proficiency tests for use by laboratories designated by WHO for HIV drug resistance surveillanceTarget product profile for HIV drug resistance tests in low- and middle-income countries: AfricaWHO manual for HIV drug resistance testing using dried blood spot specimensWHO HIVResNet HIV drug resistance laboratory operational framework HIV drug resistance surveillanceGlobal and national policy decisions on antiretroviral therapy and HIV service delivery need to be informed by reliable national data on HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) prevalence and trends. HIV treatment and pre-exposure prophylaxis scale-up should be accompanied by measures to monitor the quality of antiretroviral drug delivery and surveillance of HIVDR.Quality data should be obtained from periodic nationally representative HIVDR surveys among different populations.Laboratory-based survey of acquired HIV drug resistance using remnant viral load specimensClinical-based survey of acquired HIV drug resistanceSentinel surveys of acquired HIV resistance to dolutegravir among people receiving dolutegravir-containing antiretroviral therapySurveillance of pretreatment HIV drug resistance- populations initiating first-line ARTPretreatment HIV drug resistance is detected among people initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) with or without prior antiretroviral drug exposure. It can result from transmitted or acquired HIV drug resistance, or both. Surveillance of the pre-treatment HIV drug resistance survey in populations initiating first-line ART is relevant to inform the choice of nationally recommended first-line ART regimens, and also regimens used for pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis.Surveillance of HIV drug resistance in adults initiating antiretroviral therapy- pre – treatment HIV drug resistanceSurveillance of pretreatment HIV drug resistance- treatment -naïve infants newly diagnosed with HIVThe surveillance of pretreatment HIV drug resistance among treatment-naive infants newly diagnosed with HIV is particularly relevant in settings where many infants acquire HIV infection. Surveillance provides critical information to support optimal choice of first- and second-line antiretroviral therapy regimens.The purpose of this surveillance is to assess the prevalence of HIV drug resistance among treatment-naive infants younger than 18 months (regardless of prevention of mother-to-child transmission exposure), who have been newly diagnosed with HIV using early infant diagnosis over a 12-month period.Surveillance of HIV drug resistance in children newly diagnosed with HIV by early infant diagnosis Surveillance of HIV drug resistance- PrEP users diagnosed with HIVWHO recommends pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) as an additional prevention option for HIV-negative individuals at substantial risk of HIV infection, as part of combination prevention approaches. HIV drug resistance was rarely reported among PrEP users diagnosed with HIV in randomized controlled trials or open-label studies.However, PrEP-selected HIV drug resistance could potentially negatively impact the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy (ART) options among PrEP users who acquire HIV. This is because there is a potential for overlapping resistance profiles between antiretroviral drugs used for both PrEP and first-line ART.Therefore, WHO recommends that PrEP scale-up be accompanied by surveillance of HIV drug resistance, as resistance may compromise the effectiveness of first-line ART among PrEP users who acquire HIV.HIV drug resistance surveillance in countries scaling up pre-exposure prophylaxis \n",

In the first few weeks after initial infection, individuals may experience no symptoms or an influenza-like illness including fever, headache, rash, or sore throat.As the infection progressively weakens the immune system, an individual can develop other signs and symptoms, such as swollen lymph nodes, weight loss, fever, diarrhoea and cough. Without treatment, they could also develop severe illnesses such as tuberculosis, cryptococcal meningitis, severe bacterial infections and cancers such as lymphomas and Kaposi's sarcoma, among others.Tuberculosis (TB) remains the leading cause of death among people living with HIV, accounting for around one in three AIDS-related deaths.\n",

This early period of infection represents the time of greatest infectivity; however, HIV transmission can occur during all stages of the infection.It is best practice to also retest all people initially diagnosed as HIV-positive before they enrol in care and/or treatment to rule out any potential testing or reporting error. Notably, once a person diagnosed with HIV has started treatment, they should not be retested.Testing and diagnosis of HIV-exposed infants has been a challenge because babies carry their biological mothers’ antibodies and it can take months for these to disappear. For infants and children less than 18 months of age, serological testing is not sufficient to identify HIV infection: virologic testing must be provided (at 6 weeks of age, or at birth) to detect the presence of the virus in infants born to mothers living with HIV.\n",

It is fatal if undetected or untreated and is the leading cause of death among people with HIV, responsible for more than one out of three HIV-associated deaths.Early detection of TB and prompt linkage to TB treatment and ART can prevent these deaths. TB screening should be offered routinely at HIV care services and routine HIV testing should be offered to all patients with presumptive and diagnosed TB.

The recommendation was based on strong evidence from randomized controlled trials showing an approximately 60% lower risk.Since 2007, more than 27 million VMMC procedures have been performed in the 15 priority countries in Eastern and Southern Africa, where about half of all new HIV infections occurred. In the past 10 years, other evidence-based HIV prevention options have also been scaled up, including oral pre-exposure prophylaxis and HIV antiretroviral therapy (with its secondary HIV prevention effect), along with already known interventions, such as condom use and post-exposure prophylaxis.In the ongoing effort to end the AIDS epidemic, a re-examination of the evidence shows that VMMC remains an important intervention, alongside other effective behavioural and biomedical HIV prevention interventions.

Oral PrEP is highly effective at preventing HIV when used as directed. In 2021, WHO recommended that the dapivirine ring may be offered as an additional prevention choice for women at substantial risk of HIV and, in 2022, that long-acting injectable cabotegravir (CAB-LA) may be offered as an additional prevention choice for people at substantial risk of HIV.

      "In the African region, a number of women and girls living with HIV become pregnant each year. In the absence of intervention, the rate of transmission of HIV from a mother living with HIV to her child during pregnancy, labour, delivery or breastfeeding ranges from 15% to 45%. As such, identification of HIV infection should be immediately followed by an offer of linkage to lifelong treatment and care, including support to remain in care and virally suppressed and an offer of partner services. Elimination of MTCT of HIV is strongly supported by global commitments and the promotion of integration of prevention of MTCT interventions into maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health services, as well as strengthened health systems. In addition, improved access to sexual and reproductive health services – including preventing unintended pregnancies and screening and treatment for sexually transmitted infections in women and girls living with HIV – is being actively promoted.The integration of interventions has led to the triple elimination initiative, which not only promotes person-centered care, but also reduces incidence, morbidity and mortality. The initiative also strengthens disease monitoring using strategic information for response planning. Essential triple EMTCT services include:Testing for HIV, syphilis and HBV in antenatal care clinics.Prompt and efficacious interventions to treat women who test positive, and to prevent transmission of the infection(s) to their children.Counselling for women and their partners to reduce transmission risk and ensure appropriate treatment.Appropriately attended, safe delivery.Appropriate follow-up of exposed infants, including HBV vaccine birth dose.Optimal infant feeding; andLifelong treatment and care for mothers living with HIV, or eligible for treatment for HBV or syphilis.WHO continues to work in this area, supporting countries to improve and better monitor interventions towards ending the AIDS epidemic as a public health threat by 2030.Validation of elimination of mother-to -child transmission of HIV, syphilis and hepatitis BThe global and regional community has committed itself to the elimination of mother-to-child transmission (EMTCT) of HIV, syphilis, and hepatitis B virus (HBV) as a public health priority. The Triple EMTCT initiative focuses on a harmonized approach to improving health outcomes for mothers and children.The term validation is used to attest that a country has successfully met the criteria for EMTCT of HIV, syphilis, and HBV. WHO develops and regularly updates guidance on the criteria and processes for validation of EMTCT of HIV, syphilis and HBV. Since 2015, Member States have been able to apply for validation for achieving the reduction of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) to a level where it is no longer a public health threat or problem. In 2017, the Path to Elimination was introduced to recognize countries with high prevalence of maternal HIV, syphilis or HBV in their efforts to reduce MTCT.Achieving validation of EMTCT is a tremendous national accomplishment, requiring country-led accountability, rigorous data analysis, intensive programme assessment and multilevel collaboration. Maintaining validation is equally important and requires sustained, broad programme efforts to prevent new infections in infants, children and adults. Through the validation process, WHO and partners continue to provide country support for strengthening health system capacity and comprehensive person-centered, integrated services that respect and protect the human rights of women living with any of the conditions, and to ensure that these women are meaningfully involved in health programme planning and service delivery.Global guidance on criteria and processes for validation: elimination of mother -to-child transmission of HIV, syphilis and hepatitis B.Governance for the validation of elimination of mother to child transmission of HIV, syphilis and hepatitis B virus: an overview of validation structures and responsibilities at national, regional and global levels\n",

For reasons that are so far unexplained, in many regions where tsetse flies are found, sleeping sickness is not. Rural populations living in regions where transmission occurs and which depend on agriculture, fishing, animal husbandry or hunting are the most exposed to the tsetse fly and therefore to the disease.

      "Immunization through vaccination is the safest way to protect against disease. Vaccines protect us throughout life and at different ages, from birth into childhood, adolescence and old age.Without vaccines, we are at risk of serious illness and disability from diseases like measles, meningitis, pneumonia, tetanus and polio, among others. Many of these diseases can be life-threatening.When vaccine coverage rates drop, once-scarce deadly diseases – such as measles – can re-emerge. Universal immunization coverage is needed to help end vaccine-preventable diseases once and for all.Immunization is a low-cost, high-impact health intervention and a key driver of universal health coverage (UHC).Immunization currently prevents over 4 million deaths every year. In the African Region alone, around 800,000 lives are saved every year because of vaccines.Immunization is one of the most successful and cost-effective public health interventions: It is estimated that every $1 spent on childhood immunizations in Africa returns $44 in economic benefits. Investing in immunization keeps children healthy and safe from preventable diseases.Infants and young children are often at the greatest risk from diseases because their immune systems are not yet fully developed, and their bodies are less able to fight off infection. It is therefore very important that children are vaccinated against diseases at the recommended time.One in five children in Africa still do not receive all the necessary and basic vaccines. Every year, approximately 30 million African children fall sick from vaccine-preventable diseases, and half a million of them die as a result.Important progress has been made in vaccine research and development: The first vaccine to protect children against malaria was piloted in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi in 2019, while new vaccines to protect against Ebola are being used to help control the outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).In 2012, more than 100 cases of wild poliovirus were reported in the African Region – representing more than half of the global burden. No new cases have been reported since 2016, and in 2019 the African Region marked three years since the last confirmed case of wild poliovirus, a major milestone on the path towards eradication. The African Region is expected to be certified wild-polio-free in 2020.Meningitis A epidemics have been drastically reduced in Africa through immunization. Since the introduction of the meningitis A vaccine in Africa in 2010, mass vaccination campaigns have led to the control and near elimination of the deadly meningitis A disease in 26 African “meningitis belt” countries. The vaccine is now being integrated into routine national immunization programmes.If immunization efforts in African are not maintained, there is a risk to reverse progress made, leading to more than 2.4 million deaths and a negative economic impact of $59 billion over the next decade. Strengthening routine immunization saves lives and is a smart investment for the future.\n",

      "\n",
      "Vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) refer to the range of diseases that can be prevented and controlled by vaccination. The burden of VPDs and associated outbreaks remain a major threat to people across Africa. Every year, more than 30 million African children under the age of five suffer from VPDs; of these, more than half a million die due to limited access to immunization services – representing 58% of global deaths from VPDs.Recurrent VPD outbreaks persist in many countries in the African Region. VPD-related outbreaks tend to appear in areas where the immunization coverage rate is low, therefore enabling transmission.Major VPDs affecting the African Region include:CholeraEbola Virus DiseaseHepatitisHuman papillomavirus (HPV)InfluenzaMalariaMaternal and neonatal tetanusMeaslesMeningococcal MeningitisPneumoniaPolioRotavirusRubellaTetanusTyphoid FeverYellow FeverFour major vaccine-preventable diseases – rotavirus, pneumococcal diseases, measles and rubella – collectively cost the African Region $13 billion each year, due to loss of productivity as a result of premature death ($10 billion) and prolonged sickness ($2 billion), hospitalizations ($260 million) and outpatient visits ($73 million).Sustained control, elimination and eradication of key VPDs is vital to end preventable deaths and protect the health and wellbeing of populations across the African Region. WHO works closely with countries and partners to improve immunization coverage and prevent and control VPDs, as part of broader efforts to strengthen primary health care and help countries move towards UHC. WHO supports all countries in the African Region by establishing norms and standards, developing evidence-based policies and guidance, monitoring VPD situations, contributing to health service delivery in emergency situations, and advocating with governments and partners.\n",

      "\n",
      "Disease surveillance involves the systematic collection, analysis, interpretation, and dissemination of information regarding the occurrence of diseases in defined populations for public health action. Vaccine-preventable disease (VPD) surveillance refers to surveillance efforts primarily focusing on diseases that can be prevented or controlled by vaccination.VPD surveillance is critical to protect populations from disease – it is the foundation of disease control strategies and the most effective way to detect and respond early to outbreaks, in order to mitigate their impact on national security, the local economy and public health systems. VPD surveillance data is used to guide effective response to outbreaks, assess progress in attaining set immunization targets, determine barriers to access, and identify gaps. High quality surveillance is also important to inform decision-making by policy makers. Strengthening surveillance systems and laboratory networks is critical to accelerate efforts towards achieving universal immunization and protecting populations from disease.All countries in the African region have committed to universal immunization coverage and high-quality surveillance, but challenges remain in achieving targets outlined in the Regional Strategic Plan for Immunization (RSPI). Countries in the African Region still face major challenges in both the strategic planning and operation of their surveillance systems, including fragmentation, lack of public resources, difficulties in leveraging community-based surveillance, inadequate surveillance of some diseases, challenges with staff retention and training, and transportation issues.Over the past two decades, VPD surveillance in the African Region has been conducted in an integrated manner, supported heavily by funding from the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI). However, as the region approaches the official certification of polio eradication, significant resources for surveillance through the GPEI will ramp down, and eventually end by 2023.  Similarly, most countries in Africa will transition out of receiving support from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, by 2030.This imminent decrease in funding has the potential to significantly reverse progress made, particularly through the loss of surveillance support. By 2030, the complexity and demand for VPD surveillance is also expected to widen. Further investment is therefore critical to sustain levels of funding to support VPD surveillance and laboratory activities. In the coming years, African countries, partners and donors will need to urgently revitalize their disease surveillance systems and invest considerably in this area, to fill these gaps to ensure that hard-won progress is not reversed.Read more about WHO’s ambition for VPD surveillance in the African Region for 2020–2030Read more about WHO’s VPD surveillance standards\n",

      "              \n",
      "\n",
      "Over the years, people have increasingly expressed concerns about the potential risks associated with vaccines. An adverse event following immunization (AEFI) is any untoward medical occurrence which follows immunization, and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the usage of the vaccine. If not rapidly and effectively dealt with, these perceptions can undermine confidence in a vaccine and ultimately have dramatic consequences for immunization coverage and disease prevention.To ensure safe use of vaccines through close monitoring of vaccines-associated adverse events in the region, the VPD Programme at the WHO Regional Office for Africa supports National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) to strengthen the safety monitoring systems and build capacity to conduct prompt and scientific causality assessments.In order to respond promptly, efficiently, and with scientific rigour to vaccine safety issues, the WHO Regional Office for Africa has established an African Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (AACVS).  This committee provides independent expert advice on technical issues related to the safety, effectiveness and use of all vaccines, consistent with the Global Vaccine Action Plan (GVAP), the Regional Strategic Plan for Immunization (RSPI) and the Global Vaccine Safety Blueprint (GVSB).Read more about:Global vaccine safetyVaccine regulationVaccine quality\n",

AVAREF works with national ethics committees and regulatory authorities to ensure timely regulatory evaluations and decision-making processes on clinical trial applications and to reduce the lengthy timelines for their review and approval. The forum has supported the development and/or review of multiple vaccines in the African Region, including vaccines against malaria, meningitis, rotavirus, pneumococcal pneumonia, cholera, HPV and Ebola.Many clinical trials have been conducted and increasingly more are being planned in the African Region to evaluate the efficacy and safety of candidate vaccines. However, additional efforts are needed in this area to enhance regulatory oversight for the development and approval of new vaccines that meet quality, safety, and efficacy standards and build manufacturing capacity.\n",

The Global Vaccine Action Plan calls for all countries to establish or have access to a NITAG by 2020. As of 2018, 30 of the 47 countries in the African Region had established a NITAG, whereas 17 had not. Out of the 30 countries with NITAGs, 18 met all the WHO functionality criteria.WHO places a high priority on the development of national decision-making process and capabilities, including the establishment and strengthening of functional, independent NITAGs. WHO supports countries in the African Region by providing technical guidance for the establishment/strengthening of a NITAG, as well as providing technical guidance, including global and regional policy recommendations, to the NITAG in formulating immunization policies and strategies.The African Regional Immunization Technical Advisory Group (RITAG) is the principal advisory group to the WHO Regional Office for Africa to provide strategic guidance on vaccines and immunization. RITAG reports directly to the WHO Regional Director for Africa and advises the Regional Director on overall regional policies and strategies, ranging from vaccine and technology research and development, to delivery of immunization services and linkages between immunization and other health interventions.  Its remit is not restricted to childhood immunization but extends to all vaccine-preventable diseases as well as all age groups. Members of the RITAG are appointed to serve for an initial term of three years, renewable once.Additional resources:Report of the Regional Immunization Technical Advisory Group meeting, November 2020Report of the Regional Immunization Technical Advisory Group meeting, July 2020Report of the Regional Immunization Technical Advisory Group meeting, January 2019Report of the Regional Immunization Technical Advisory Group meeting, June 2018Report of the Regional Immunization Technical Advisory Group meeting, December 2017Report of the Regional Immunization Technical Advisory Group meeting, June 2017\n",

      "The most effective way to prevent the disease is vaccination. Safe and effective vaccines are available and have been used for more than 60 years. Among healthy adults, influenza vaccine provides protection, even when circulating viruses may not exactly match the vaccine viruses.However, among the elderly, influenza vaccination may be less effective in preventing illness but reduces severity of disease and incidence of complications and deaths. Vaccination is especially important for people at higher risk of serious influenza complications, and for people who live with, or care for, high risk individuals.WHO recommends annual vaccination for:pregnant women at any stage of pregnancychildren aged between 6 months to 5 yearselderly individuals (aged more than 65 years)individuals with chronic medical conditionshealth-care workers.Influenza vaccine is most effective when circulating viruses are well-matched with viruses contained in vaccines. Due to the constant evolving nature of influenza viruses, the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) – a network of National Influenza Centres and WHO Collaborating Centres around the world – continuously monitors the influenza viruses circulating in humans and updates the composition of influenza vaccines twice a year.For many years, WHO has updated its recommendation on the composition of the vaccine that targets the 3 (trivalent) most representative virus types in circulation (two subtypes of influenza A viruses and one influenza B virus). Starting with the 2013–2014 northern hemisphere influenza season, a 4th component is recommended to support quadrivalent vaccine development. Quadrivalent vaccines include a 2nd influenza B virus in addition to the viruses in trivalent vaccines, and are expected to provide wider protection against influenza B virus infections. A number of inactivated influenza vaccines and recombinant influenza vaccines are available in injectable form. Live attenuated influenza vaccine is available as a nasal spray.\n",

Currently, the majority of circulating influenza viruses are resistant to the adamantanes and WHO recommends neuraminidase inhibitors as the first-line treatment for people requiring antiviral therapy.\n",

      "\n",
      "Though first described in the 1950s, the virus causing Lassa disease was not identified until 1969. The virus is a single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the virus family Arenaviridae.About 80% of people who become infected with Lassa virus have no symptoms. 1 in 5 infections result in severe disease, where the virus affects several organs such as the liver, spleen and kidneys.Lassa fever is a zoonotic disease, meaning that humans become infected from contact with infected animals. The animal reservoir, or host, of Lassa virus is a rodent of the genus Mastomys, commonly known as the “multimammate rat.” Mastomys rats infected with Lassa virus do not become ill, but they can shed the virus in their urine and faeces.Because the clinical course of the disease is so variable, detection of the disease in affected patients has been difficult. When presence of the disease is confirmed in a community, however, prompt isolation of affected patients, good infection prevention and control practices, and rigorous contact tracing can stop outbreaks.Lassa fever is known to be endemic in Benin (where it was diagnosed for the first time in November 2014), Ghana (diagnosed for the first time in October 2011), Guinea, Liberia, Mali (diagnosed for the first time in February 2009), Sierra Leone, and Nigeria, but probably exists in other West African countries as well.\n",

      "The incubation period of Lassa fever ranges from 6–21 days. The onset of the disease, when it is symptomatic, is usually gradual, starting with fever, general weakness, and malaise. After a few days, headache, sore throat, muscle pain, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, cough, and abdominal pain may follow. In severe cases facial swelling, fluid in the lung cavity, bleeding from the mouth, nose, vagina or gastrointestinal tract and low blood pressure may develop.Protein may be noted in the urine. Shock, seizures, tremor, disorientation, and coma may be seen in the later stages. Deafness occurs in 25% of patients who survive the disease. In half of these cases, hearing returns partially after 1–3 months. Transient hair loss and gait disturbance may occur during recovery.Death usually occurs within 14 days of onset in fatal cases. The disease is especially severe late in pregnancy, with maternal death and/or fetal loss occurring in more than 80% of cases during the third trimester.\n",

Lassa virus may also be spread between humans through direct contact with the blood, urine, faeces, or other bodily secretions of a person infected with Lassa fever. There is no epidemiological evidence supporting airborne spread between humans. Person-to-person transmission occurs in both community and health-care settings, where the virus may be spread by contaminated medical equipment, such as re-used needles. Sexual transmission of Lassa virus has been reported.Lassa fever occurs in all age groups and both sexes. Persons at greatest risk are those living in rural areas where Mastomys are usually found, especially in communities with poor sanitation or crowded living conditions. Health workers are at risk if caring for Lassa fever patients in the absence of proper barrier nursing and infection prevention and control practices.\n",

Lassa fever is difficult to distinguish from other viral haemorrhagic fevers such as Ebola virus disease as well as other diseases that cause fever, including malaria, shigellosis, typhoid fever and yellow fever.Definitive diagnosis requires testing that is available only in reference laboratories. Laboratory specimens may be hazardous and must be handled with extreme care. Lassa virus infections can only be diagnosed definitively in the laboratory using the following tests:reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assayantibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)antigen detection testsvirus isolation by cell culture.\n",

      "\n",
      "Prevention of Lassa fever relies on promoting good “community hygiene” to discourage rodents from entering homes. Effective measures include storing grain and other foodstuffs in rodent-proof containers, disposing of garbage far from the home, maintaining clean households and keeping cats. Because Mastomys are so abundant in endemic areas, it is not possible to completely eliminate them from the environment. Family members should always be careful to avoid contact with blood and body fluids while caring for sick persons.In health-care settings, staff should always apply standard infection prevention and control precautions when caring for patients, regardless of their presumed diagnosis. These include basic hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene, use of personal protective equipment (to block splashes or other contact with infected materials), safe injection practices and safe burial practices.Health-care workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed Lassa fever should apply extra infection control measures to prevent contact with the patient’s blood and body fluids and contaminated surfaces or materials such as clothing and bedding. When in close contact (within 1 metre) of patients with Lassa fever, health-care workers should wear face protection (a face shield or a medical mask and goggles), a clean, non-sterile long-sleeved gown, and gloves (sterile gloves for some procedures).Laboratory workers are also at risk. Samples taken from humans and animals for investigation of Lassa virus infection should be handled by trained staff and processed in suitably equipped laboratories under maximum biological containment conditions.On rare occasions, travellers from areas where Lassa fever is endemic export the disease to other countries. Although malaria, typhoid fever, and many other tropical infections are much more common, the diagnosis of Lassa fever should be considered in febrile patients returning from West Africa, especially if they have had exposures in rural areas or hospitals in countries where Lassa fever is known to be endemic. Health-care workers seeing a patient suspected to have Lassa fever should immediately contact local and national experts for advice and to arrange for laboratory testing.\n",

Sandflies are attracted to crowded housing because it is easier to bite people and feed on their blood. Human behaviour, such as sleeping outside or on the ground, may increase risk.MalnutritionDiets lacking protein-energy, iron, vitamin A and zinc increase the risk that an infection will progress to a full-blown disease.Population mobilityEpidemics of leishmaniasis often occur when many people who are not immune move into areas where the transmission is high.Environmental and climate changesThe incidence of leishmaniasis can be affected by changes in urbanization, deforestation or the human incursion into forested areas.Climate change is affecting the spread of leishmaniasis though changes in temperature and rainfall, which affect the size and geographic distribution of sandfly populations. Drought, famine and flood also cause migration of people into areas where the transmission of the parasite is high.\n",

The common clinical signs for VL are non-tender splenomegaly, with or without hepatomegaly, wasting and pallor of mucous membranes.Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL): The clinical features of cutaneous leishmaniasis tend to vary depending on the leishmania species causing the disease, immunological status and also perhaps genetically determined responses of patients. The typical CL lesion starts as a papule or nodule at the site of inoculation. A crust may develop centrally to for ulcer and induration, which often heals gradually over months or years, leaving a depressed scar with altered pigmentation. Sometimes the lesion(s) can be big and severe and require treatment.Picture showing cutaneous leishmaniasis lesion receiving intralesional therapy (Gondar hospital, Ethiopia, photo credit by Eleni Ayele)Muco-cutaneous leishmaniasis (MCL): this is due to the involvement of the mucosal tissues of the mouth and upper respiratory tract by the leishmania parasites.

In visceral leishmaniasis, diagnosis is made by combining clinical signs with parasitological or serological tests (such as rapid diagnostic tests). In cutaneous and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis serological tests have limited value and clinical manifestation with parasitological tests confirms the diagnosis.The treatment of leishmaniasis depends on several factors including type of disease, concomitant pathologies, parasite species and geographic location. Leishmaniasis is a treatable and curable disease, which requires an immunocompetent system because medicines will not get rid of the parasite from the body, thus the risk of relapse if immunosuppression occurs. All patients diagnosed with visceral leishmaniasis require prompt and complete treatment. Detailed information on the treatment is available in the WHO technical report series 949, Control of leishmaniasis and the latest guidelines published on HIV-VL in east Africa and South-East Asia and the guideline for the treatment of leishmaniasis in the Americas.  \n",

There are highly effective and safe anti-leishmanial medicines particularly for visceral leishmaniasis, although they can be difficult to use. Access to medicines has significantly improved thanks to a WHO-negotiated price scheme and a medicine donation programme through WHO.Vector control helps to reduce or interrupt transmission of disease by decreasing the number of sandflies. Control methods include insecticide spray, use of insecticide-treated nets, environmental management and personal protection.Effective disease surveillance is important to promptly monitor and act during epidemics and situations with high case fatality rates under treatment.Control of animal reservoir hosts is complex and should be tailored to the local situation.Social mobilization and strengthening partnerships – mobilization and education of the community with effective behavioural change interventions must always be locally adapted.

However, the leprosy burden and pockets of hotspots remain in many countries with more than 20,000 new cases reported every year in our Region.During 2023, there were 182 815 new cases reported globally with 21 043 (11.5%) new cases from 45 out 47 countries in African Region corresponding to a rate of detection of 17.2 per million population.The geographical distribution of new Leprosy cases in 2023 in the Africa region is as follows:Four countries reported 0 cases: Algeria, Lesotho, Eswatini, Seychelles.Nine countries reported 1 to 10 new cases: Botswana, Cape Verde, Eritrea, Gabon, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Equatorial Guinea, São Tomé and Príncipe, Zimbabwe.Ten countries reported 11 to 100 new cases: Benin, Cameroon, Kenya, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Namibia, Rwanda, Togo, South Africa.Sixteen countries reported 101 to 1000 new cases.Six countries reported more than 1000 new cases: Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Madagascar, Mozambique, Nigeria, Tanzania.2 countries did not report any cases: Mauritius and Zambia.The occurrence of new leprosy cases among children serves as a proxy indicator for recent transmission. In 2023, a total of 1,633 new child cases (7.8% of all new cases) were reported in the African Region, corresponding to a rate of 2.6 per million child population. New cases with Grade 2 Disability (G2D) indicate delayed case detection. In the African region, 3,026 new cases with G2D were detected, corresponding to a rate of 2.5 per million population, accounting for 14.4% of all new cases detected during the year. This increase could be linked to the resumption of activities following the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as a decrease in expertise at the country level.More detailed information on key leprosy indicators is available on The Global Health Observatory. \n",

      "\n",
      "The leprosy situation in the African Region is currently characterized by a slow but steady decline in both detection and prevalence rates. Between 2013 and 2023, the leprosy prevalence rate decreased from 24.4 to 20.4 cases per million, while the detection rate also declined from 22.5 to 17.2 cases per million. Leprosy elimination as a public health problem has been achieved and sustained in almost all countries of the region. Notably, eight out of the 47 countries (17%) in the region have reported no new cases among children for over five years, positioning them close to achieving the interruption of transmission.Despite these achievements, there remains a need to maintain high-level political commitment and secure continued donor support for essential activities, such as integrated capacity building, active case finding, and the supply and logistics of Multi-Drug Therapy (MDT). These efforts are crucial to achieving the interruption of leprosy transmission by 2030, in line with the new NTDs roadmap targets. \n",

      "DiagnosisThe diagnosis of leprosy is done clinically. Laboratory-based services may be required in cases that are difficult to diagnose or to monitor drug resistance. The disease manifests commonly through skin lesion and peripheral nerve involvement. Leprosy is diagnosed by finding at least one of the following cardinal signs: (1) definite loss of sensation in a pale (hypopigmented) or reddish skin patch; (2) thickened or enlarged peripheral nerve, with loss of sensation and/or weakness of the muscles supplied by that nerve; (3) microscopic detection of bacilli in a slit-skin smear.Based on the above, the cases are classified into two types for treatment purposes: Paucibacillary (PB) case and Multibacillary (MB) case.PB case: a case of leprosy with 1 to 5 skin lesions, without demonstrated presence of bacilli in a skin smear.MB case: a case of leprosy with more than five skin lesions; or with nerve involvement (pure neuritis, or any number of skin lesions and neuritis); or with the demonstrated presence of bacilli in a slit-skin smear, irrespective of the number of skin lesions. \n",

      "High risk foods include deli meat and ready-to-eat meat products (such as cooked, cured and/or fermented meats and sausages), soft cheeses and cold smoked fishery products.\n",
      "Pregnant women, the elderly or individuals with a weakened immune system, such as people with immuno-compromised status due to HIV/AIDS, leukaemia, cancer, kidney transplant and steroid therapy, are at greatest risk of severe listeriosis and should avoid high risk foods.\n",

      "\n",
      "Listeriosis is a series of diseases caused by the bacteria L. monocytogenes, outbreaks of which occur in all countries. There are two main types of listeriosis: a non-invasive form and an invasive form.\n",
      "Noninvasive listeriosis (febrile listerial gastroenteritis) is a mild form of the disease affecting mainly otherwise healthy people. Symptoms include diarrhoea, fever, headache and myalgia (muscle pain). The incubation period is short (a few days). Outbreaks of this disease have generally involved the ingestion of foods containing high doses of L. monocytogenes.\n",
      "Invasive listeriosis is a more severe form of the disease and affects certain high risk groups of the population. These include pregnant women, patients undergoing treatment for cancer, AIDS and organ transplants, elderly people and infants. This form of disease is characterized by severe symptoms and a high mortality rate (20%–30%). The symptoms include fever, myalgia (muscle pain), septicemia, meningitis. The incubation period is usually one to two weeks but can vary between a few days and up to 90 days.\n",
      "The initial diagnosis of listeriosis is made based on clinical symptoms and detection of the bacteria in a smear from blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), meconium of newborns (or the fetus in abortion cases), as well as from faeces, vomitus, foods or animal feed. Various detection methods, including polymerase chain reaction (PCR), are available for diagnosis of listeriosis in humans. During pregnancy, blood and placenta cultures are the most reliable ways to discover if symptoms are due to listeriosis.\n",
      "Pregnant women are about 20 times more likely to contract listeriosis than other healthy adults. It can result in miscarriage or stillbirth. Newborn may also have low birth weight, septicaemia and meningitis. People with HIV/AIDS are at least 300 times more likely to get ill than those with a normally functioning immune system.\n",
      "Due to the long incubation period, it is challenging to identify the food which was the actual source of the infection.\n",

      "The control of L. monocytogenes is required at all stages in the food chain and an integrated approach is needed to prevent the multiplication of this bacteria in the final food product. The challenges for controlling L. monocytogenes are considerable given its ubiquitous nature, high resistance to common preservative methods, such as the use of salt, smoke or acidic condition in the food, and its ability to survive and grow at refrigeration temperatures (around 5 °C). All sectors of the food chain should Implement Good Hygienic Practices (GHP) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) as well as implement a food safety management system based on the principles of Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points (HACCP).\n",
      "Guidelines on the application of general principles of food hygiene to the control of Listeria monocytogenes in ready-to-eat foods [PDF]\n",
      "Food manufacturers should also test against microbiological criteria, as appropriate, when validating and verifying the correct functioning of their HACCP based procedures and other hygiene control measures. In addition, producers manufacturing food associated with risks of Listeria must conduct environmental monitoring to identify and eliminate niche environments, including areas that favor the establishment and proliferation of L. monocytogenes.\n",
      "Modern technologies using genetic fingerprint - Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) - allow for more rapid identification of the food source of listeriosis outbreaks by linking L. monocytogens isolated from patients with those isolated from foods.\n",

The economic costs are also significant.  Between 1965 and 1990, countries in which a large proportion of the population lived in regions with malaria experienced an average growth in per-capita GDP of 0.4% per year, whereas average growth in other countries was 2.3% per year.\n",

      "RationaleThe WHO Global technical strategy for malaria 2016–2030, provides a technical framework for all malaria-endemic countries. It is intended to guide and support regional and country programmes as they work towards malaria control and elimination. The strategy sets ambitious but achievable global targets, including:reducing malaria mortality rates by at least 90% by 2030reducing malaria case incidence by at least 90% by 2030eliminating malaria in at least 35 countries by 2030preventing a resurgence of malaria in all countries that are malaria-free.How far is the WHO African Region to achieve the above targets?   Key messagesAnalysis of the trends shows that, in 2022, the WHO African Region was off track for both the malaria morbidity and mortality GTS milestones.In 2022, an estimated 580 479 people lost their lives due to malaria in the WHO African Region, which represented 95.4% of total deaths globally, including 78.1% of deaths in children under five compared with 90.7% in 2000.In 2022, an estimated 233 million cases of malaria in the WHO African Region, which represented 93.6% of total cases globallyBetween 2019 and 2022, there were substantial increases in estimated case numbers in Nigeria (5.3 million), Ethiopia (2.4 million), Madagascar (1.5 million), Uganda (1.3 million), the United Republic of Tanzania (1.3 million), Mali (1.1 million) and Mozambique (1 million). Over the same period, Rwanda saw a decrease of more than 3.8 million cases.Cabo Verde was certified malaria-free.Reduction of malaria mortality rates The WHO African Region, with an estimated 233 million cases in 2022, accounted for about 94% of cases globally.Twenty-nine countries accounted for 95% of malaria cases globally. Four countries – Nigeria (27%), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (12%), Uganda (5%) and Mozambique (4%) – accounted for almost half of all cases globally.Burden of malaria in pregnancyIn 2022, in 33 moderate and high transmission countries in the WHO African Region, there were an estimated 35.4 million pregnancies, of which 12.7 million (36%) were exposed to malaria infection during pregnancy.By WHO subregion, prevalence of exposure to malaria during pregnancy in 2022 was highest in west Africa (39.3%) and central Africa (40.1%), and lower in the east and southern Africa subregion (27.0%).Malaria cases and deaths avertedGlobally, an estimated 2.1 billion malaria cases and 11.7 million malaria deaths were averted in the period 2000–2022.Most of the cases and deaths averted were in the WHO African Region (cases 82%, deaths 94%), followed by the WHO South-East Asia Region (cases 10%, deaths 3%).Burden of malaria in pregnancy In 2022, in 33 moderate and high transmission countries in the WHO African Region, there were an estimated 35.4 million pregnancies, of which 12.7 million (36%) were exposed to malaria infection during pregnancy.By WHO subregion, prevalence of exposure to malaria during pregnancy in 2022 was highest in west Africa (39.3%) and central Africa (40.1%), and lower in the east and southern Africa subregion (27.0%).It is estimated that, without a pregnancy-specific intervention, malaria infection during pregnancy in these 33 countries would have resulted in 914 000 neonates with low birthweight, compared with about 393 000 neonates with low birthweight estimated at the current intermittent preventive treatment during pregnancy (IPTp) coverage levels in the three subregions.Malaria EliminationOver time, the elimination of malaria has gained momentum in numerous countries as they approach the milestone of zero indigenous malaria cases and as more countries are certified malaria free.Despite the setbacks, several countries and one territory saw notable reductions in indigenous transmission: Botswana (43.5%), the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (9.3%), Ecuador (38.0%), Eswatini (57.6%), French Guiana (71.6%), Mexico (32.6%) and South Africa (31.3%).Investments in malaria programmes and researchThe GTS sets out estimates of the funding required to achieve milestones for 2025 and 2030. Total annual resources needed were estimated at US$ 6.8 billion in 2020, rising to US$ 9.3 billion in 2025 and US$ 10.3 billion by 2030. An additional US$ 0.85 billion is estimated to be required annually for global malaria research and development (R&D) during the period 2021–2030.Governments of malaria endemic countries contributed more than a third of total funding in 2022, with investments of over US$ 1.5 billion, of which nearly US$ 0.4 billion was spent on malaria case management in the public sector and over US$ 1.1 billion on other malaria control activities. This was a substantial increase of over US$ 0.4 billion since 2021, largely stemming from an influx of domestic spending in the WHO African Region.Distribution and coverage of malaria preventionBy 2022, 70% of households in sub-Saharan Africa had at least one ITN, increasing from about 5% in 2000. The percentage of households owning at least one ITN for every two people increased from 1% in 2000 to 40% in 2022. In the same period, the percentage of the population with access to an ITN within their household increased from 3% to 56%.Distribution and coverage of malaria diagnosis and treatmentGlobally, 3.9 billion rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for malaria were sold by manufacturers in 2010–2022, with 82% of these sales being in sub-Saharan African countries. In the same period, NMPs distributed 2.9 billion RDTs – 90% in sub-Saharan Africa.Between 2000 and 2019, case incidence in the WHO African Region decreased from 370 to 226 per 1000 population at risk, but increased to 232 per 1000 population at risk in 2020, mainly because of disruptions to services during the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2022, case incidence declined to 223 per 1000 population at risk.Cabo Verde reported zero indigenous cases for 4 consecutive years, ending its malaria epidemic.Malaria deathsAbout 96% of malaria deaths globally were in 29 countries. Four countries accounted for just over half of all malaria deaths globally in 2022 – Nigeria (31%), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (12%), Niger (6%) and the United Republic of Tanzania (4%).Malaria deaths in the WHO African Region decreased from 808 000 in 2000 to 548 000 in 2017, before increasing to 604 000 in 2020. Estimated deaths decreased again to 580 000 in 2022. The malaria mortality rate decreased by 60% between 2000 and 2019, from 143 to 57 deaths per 100 000 population at risk, before rising to 61 in 2020 and decreasing again to 56 in 2022.Cabo Verde has reported zero malaria deaths since 2018.  Malaria cases and deaths avertedGlobally, an estimated 2.1 billion malaria cases and 11.7 million malaria deaths were averted in the period 2000–2022.Most of the cases and deaths averted were in the WHO African Region (cases 82%, deaths 94%), followed by the WHO South-East Asia Region (cases 10%, deaths 3%).Malaria Estimated Cases In the African Region, WHO 2023Estimated prevalence of exposure to malaria infection during pregnancy, overall and by subregion in 2022, in moderate to high transmission countries in the WHO African Region Sources: Imperial College and WHO estimate Estimated number of children with low birthweight (WMR 2023)    InterventionPregnant women attending antenatal care  at least once and receiving at least 3 doses of Intermittent Preventive Treatment of Malaria for Pregnant Women (IPTp3) (%)     in the African Region, WHO 2021Number of ITN delivered by manufacturers and distributed by NMPs, 2010-2023Indicators of population level access to ITNs, sub-Saharian Africa, 2000-2022 and b) indicators of population-level use of ITNs, sub-Saharan Africa, 2000-2022, Source; ITN coverage model by the Malaria Atlas Project. Indicators of population level access to ITNs, sub-Saharian Africa, 2000-2022 and b) indicators of population-level use of ITNs, sub-Saharan Africa, 2000-2022, Source; ITN coverage model by the Malaria Atlas Project. Percentage of pregnant women attending an ANC clinic at least once and receiving IPTp, by number of SP doses, sub-Saharan Africa, 2010–2022 Sources: NMP reports, CDC and WHO estimates  \n",

Burial ceremonies where mourners have direct contact with the body of the deceased can play a significant role in the transmission of Marburg. Transmission via infected semen can occur up to seven weeks after clinical recovery.Transmission to health-care workers has been reported while treating Marburg patients, through close contact without the use of correct infection control precautions. Transmission via contaminated injection equipment or through needle-stick injuries is associated with more severe disease, rapid deterioration, and, possibly, a higher fatality rate.\n",

      "The incubation period (interval from infection to onset of symptoms) varies from 2 to 21 days.Illness caused by Marburg virus begins abruptly, with high fever, severe headache and severe malaise. Muscle aches and pains are a common feature. Severe watery diarrhoea, abdominal pain and cramping, nausea and vomiting can begin on the third day. Diarrhoea can persist for a week. The appearance of patients at this phase has been described as showing “ghost-like” drawn features, deep-set eyes, expressionless faces, and extreme lethargy. In the 1967 European outbreak, non-itchy rash was a feature noted in most patients between 2 and 7 days after onset of symptoms.Many patients develop severe haemorrhagic manifestations between 5 and 7 days, and fatal cases usually have some form of bleeding, often from multiple areas. Fresh blood in vomitus and faeces is often accompanied by bleeding from the nose, gums, and vagina. Spontaneous bleeding at venepuncture sites (where intravenous access is obtained to give fluids or obtain blood samples) can be particularly troublesome. During the severe phase of illness, patients have sustained high fever. Involvement of the central nervous system can result in confusion, irritability, and aggression. Orchitis has been reported occasionally in the late phase of disease (15 days).In fatal cases, death occurs most often between 8 and 9 days after symptom onset, usually preceded by severe blood loss and shock.\n",

During work or research activities or tourist visits in mines or caves inhabited by fruit bat colonies, people should wear gloves and other appropriate protective clothing (including masks).Reducing the risk of human-to-human transmission in the community arising from direct or close contact with infected patients, particularly with their body fluids. Close physical contact with Marburg patients should be avoided. Gloves and appropriate personal protective equipment should be worn when taking care of ill patients at home. Regular hand washing should be performed after visiting sick relatives in hospital, as well as after taking care of ill patients at home.Communities affected by Marburg should make efforts to ensure that the population is well informed, both about the nature of the disease itself and about necessary outbreak containment measures, including burial of the dead.

      "The high number of maternal deaths in some areas of the world reflects inequities in access to health services, and highlights the gap between rich and poor. Almost all maternal deaths (99%) occur in developing countries. More than half of these deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa and almost one third occur in South Asia. More than half of maternal deaths occur in fragile and humanitarian settings.The maternal mortality ratio in developing countries in 2015 is 239 per 100 000 live births versus 12 per 100 000 live births in developed countries. There are large disparities between countries, but also within countries, and between women with high and low income and those women living in rural versus urban areas.The risk of maternal mortality is highest for adolescent girls under 15 years old and complications in pregnancy and childbirth is a leading cause of death among adolescent girls in developing countries.2, 3Women in developing countries have, on average, many more pregnancies than women in developed countries, and their lifetime risk of death due to pregnancy is higher. A woman’s lifetime risk of maternal death – the probability that a 15 year old woman will eventually die from a maternal cause – is 1 in 4900 in developed countries, versus 1 in 180 in developing countries. In countries designated as fragile states, the risk is 1 in 54; showing the consequences from breakdowns in health systems.\n",

      "Most maternal deaths are preventable, as the health-care solutions to prevent or manage complications are well known. All women need access to antenatal care in pregnancy, skilled care during childbirth, and care and support in the weeks after childbirth. Maternal health and newborn health are closely linked. It was estimated that approximately 2.7 million newborn babies died in 20155, and an additional 2.6 million are stillborn6. It is particularly important that all births are attended by skilled health professionals, as timely management and treatment can make the difference between life and death for both the mother and the baby.Severe bleeding after birth can kill a healthy woman within hours if she is unattended. Injecting oxytocin immediately after childbirth effectively reduces the risk of bleeding.Infection after childbirth can be eliminated if good hygiene is practiced and if early signs of infection are recognized and treated in a timely manner.Pre-eclampsia should be detected and appropriately managed before the onset of convulsions (eclampsia) and other life-threatening complications. Administering drugs such as magnesium sulfate for pre-eclampsia can lower a woman’s risk of developing eclampsia.To avoid maternal deaths, it is also vital to prevent unwanted and too-early pregnancies. All women, including adolescents, need access to contraception, safe abortion services to the full extent of the law, and quality post-abortion care.\n",

      "Poor women in remote areas are the least likely to receive adequate health care. This is especially true for regions with low numbers of skilled health workers, such as sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Globally in 2015, births in the richest 20 per cent of households were more than twice as likely to be attended by skilled health personnel as those in the poorest 20 per cent of households (89 per cent versus 43 per cent). This means that millions of births are not assisted by a midwife, a doctor or a trained nurse.In high-income countries, virtually all women have at least four antenatal care visits, are attended by a skilled health worker during childbirth and receive postpartum care. In 2015, only 40% of all pregnant women in low-income countries had the recommended antenatal care visits.Other factors that prevent women from receiving or seeking care during pregnancy and childbirth are:povertydistancelack of informationinadequate servicescultural practices.To improve maternal health, barriers that limit access to quality maternal health services must be identified and addressed at all levels of the health system.\n",

      "Measles is caused by a virus in the paramyxovirus family and it is normally passed through direct contact and through the air. The virus infects the respiratory tract , then spreads throughout the body. Measles is a human disease and is not known to occur in animals.\n",
      "Accelerated immunization activities have had a major impact on reducing measles deaths. During 2000-2015, measles vaccination prevented an estimated 20.3 million deaths. Global measles deaths have decreased by 79% from an estimated 651 600 in 2000* to 134 200 in 2015.\n",

      "\n",
      "The first sign of measles is usually a high fever, which begins about 10 to 12 days after exposure to the virus, and lasts 4 to 7 days. A runny nose, a cough, red and watery eyes, and small white spots inside the cheeks can develop in the initial stage. After several days, a rash erupts, usually on the face and upper neck. Over about 3 days, the rash spreads, eventually reaching the hands and feet. The rash lasts for 5 to 6 days, and then fades. On average, the rash occurs 14 days after exposure to the virus (within a range of 7 to 18 days).Most measles-related deaths are caused by complications associated with the disease. Complications are more common in children under the age of 5, or adults over the age of 20. The most serious complications include blindness, encephalitis (an infection that causes brain swelling), severe diarrhoea and related dehydration, ear infections, or severe respiratory infections such as pneumonia. Severe measles is more likely among poorly nourished young children, especially those with insufficient vitamin A, or whose immune systems have been weakened by HIV/AIDS or other diseases.In populations with high levels of malnutrition and a lack of adequate health care, up to 10% of measles cases result in death. Women infected while pregnant are also at risk of severe complications and the pregnancy may end in miscarriage or preterm delivery. People who recover from measles are immune for the rest of their lives.\n",

      "Unvaccinated young children are at highest risk of measles and its complications, including death. Unvaccinated pregnant women are also at risk. Any non-immune person (who has not been vaccinated or was vaccinated but did not develop immunity) can become infected.Measles is still common in many developing countries – particularly in parts of Africa and Asia. The overwhelming majority (more than 95%) of measles deaths occur in countries with low per capita incomes and weak health infrastructures.Measles outbreaks can be particularly deadly in countries experiencing or recovering from a natural disaster or conflict. Damage to health infrastructure and health services interrupts routine immunization, and overcrowding in residential camps greatly increases the risk of infection.\n",

Antibiotics should be prescribed to treat eye and ear infections, and pneumonia.All children in developing countries diagnosed with measles should receive two doses of vitamin A supplements, given 24 hours apart. This treatment restores low vitamin A levels during measles that occur even in well-nourished children and can help prevent eye damage and blindness.

      "Routine measles vaccination for children, combined with mass immunization campaigns in countries with high case and death rates, are key public health strategies to reduce global measles deaths. The measles vaccine has been in use for over 50 years. It is safe, effective and inexpensive. It costs approximately one US dollar to immunize a child against measles.The measles vaccine is often incorporated with rubella and/or mumps vaccines in countries where these illnesses are problems. It is equally effective in the single or combined form. Adding rubella to measles vaccine increases the cost only slightly, and allows for shared delivery and administration costs.In 2015, about 85% of the world's children received 1 dose of measles vaccine by their first birthday through routine health services – up from 73% in 2000. Two doses of the vaccine are recommended to ensure immunity and prevent outbreaks, as about 15% of vaccinated children fail to develop immunity from the first dose.\n",

SAGE recommends an increased focus on improving immunization systems in general to ensure that the gains made thus far in measles control can be sustained.WHO will continue to strengthen the global laboratory network to ensure timely diagnosis of measles and track international spread of the measles viruses to allow more coordinated approach in targeting vaccination activities and reduce measles deaths from this vaccine-preventable disease.\n",

      "Before 2010 and the mass preventive immunization campaigns, Group A meningococcus accounted for an estimated 80–85% of all cases in the meningitis belt, with epidemics occurring at intervals of 7–14 years. Since then, the proportion of the A serogroup has declined dramatically.\n",
      "During the 2014 epidemic season, 19 African countries implementing enhanced surveillance reported 11 908 suspected cases including 1146 deaths, the lowest numbers since the implementation of enhanced surveillance through a functional network (2004).\n",

Close and prolonged contact – such as kissing, sneezing or coughing on someone, or living in close quarters (such as a dormitory, sharing eating or drinking utensils) with an infected person (a carrier) – facilitates the spread of the disease. The average incubation period is 4 days, but can range between 2 and 10 days.Neisseria meningitidis only infects humans; there is no animal reservoir. The bacteria can be carried in the throat and sometimes, for reasons not fully understood, can overwhelm the body's defenses allowing infection to spread through the bloodstream to the brain. It is believed that 10% to 20% of the population carries Neisseria meningitidis in their throat at any given time. However, the carriage rate may be higher in epidemic situations.\n",

Appropriate antibiotic treatment must be started as soon as possible, ideally after the lumbar puncture has been carried out if such a puncture can be performed immediately. If treatment is started prior to the lumbar puncture it may be difficult to grow the bacteria from the spinal fluid and confirm the diagnosis.A range of antibiotics can treat the infection, including penicillin, ampicillin, chloramphenicol and ceftriaxone.

      "There are 3 types of vaccines available.Polysaccharide vaccines have been available to prevent the disease for over 30 years. Meningococcal polysaccharide vaccines are available in either bivalent (groups A and C), trivalent (groups A, C and W), or tetravalent (groups A, C, Y and W) forms to control the disease.For group B, polysaccharide vaccines cannot be developed, due to antigenic mimicry with polysaccharide in human neurologic tissues. The first vaccine against NmB, made from a combination of 4 protein components, was released in 2014.Since 1999, meningococcal conjugate vaccines against group C have been available and widely used. Tetravalent A, C, Y and W conjugate vaccines have been licensed since 2005 for use in children and adults in Canada, the United States of America, and Europe.The extended meningitis belt of sub-Saharan Africa, stretching from Senegal in the west to Ethiopia in the east (26 countries), has the highest rates of the disease. The 26 countries include: Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Côte d’Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Kenya, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania, Togo and Uganda. The risk of meningococcal meningitis epidemics differs within and among these 26 countries.In December 2010, a new meningococcal A conjugate vaccine was introduced nationwide in Burkina Faso, and in selected regions of Mali and Niger (the remaining regions were covered in 2011), targeting persons 1 to 29 years of age. As of June 2015, 220 million persons have been vaccinated with this vaccine in 16 countries (Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Côte d’Ivoire, Ethiopia, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sudan, and Togo).The MenA conjugate vaccine has several advantages over existing polysaccharide vaccines:it induces a higher and more sustainable immune response against group A meningococcus;it reduces the carriage of the bacteria in the throat and thus its transmission;it is expected to confer long-term protection not only for those who receive the vaccine, but on family members and others who would otherwise have been exposed to meningitis;it is available at a lower price than other meningococcal vaccines (around 0.50 USD per dose, other meningococcal vaccine prices range from 2.50 USD to 117.00 USD per dose); andit is expected to be particularly effective in protecting children under two years of age, who do not respond to conventional polysaccharide vaccines.In addition, its thermostability allows for a use under Controlled Temperature Chain (CTC) conditions. More than 2 million persons in 4 countries have been vaccinated without ice use at the vaccination site.It is planned that all 26 African countries considered at risk for meningitis epidemics and targeted by this vaccine introduction programme will have introduced this vaccine by 2016. High coverage of the target age group of 1–29 years is expected to eliminate meningococcal A epidemics from this region of Africa.\n",

During the dry season between December to June, dust winds, cold nights and upper respiratory tract infections combine to damage the nasopharyngeal mucosa, increasing the risk of meningococcal disease. At the same time, transmission of N. meningitidis may be facilitated by overcrowded housing and by large population displacements at the regional level due to pilgrimages and traditional markets. This combination of factors explains the large epidemics which occur during the dry season in the meningitis belt.Following the successful roll-out of the MenA conjugate vaccine, epidemics due to N. meningitidis serogroup A are disappearing, but other meningococcal serogroups such as NmW, NmX and NmC still cause epidemics albeit at a lower frequency and smaller size.\n",

Every suicide is a tragedy that affects families, communities and entire countries and has long-lasting effects on the people left behind. Suicide occurs throughout the lifespan and was the second leading cause of death among 15–29-year-olds globally in 2015.Suicide does not just occur in high-income countries, but is a global phenomenon in all regions of the world. In fact, over 78% of global suicides occurred in low- and middle-income countries in 2015.Suicide is a serious public health problem; however, suicides are preventable with timely, evidence-based and often low-cost interventions. For national responses to be effective, a comprehensive multisectoral suicide prevention strategy is needed.Who is at risk?While the link between suicide and mental disorders (in particular, depression and alcohol use disorders) is well established in high-income countries, many suicides happen impulsively in moments of crisis with a breakdown in the ability to deal with life stresses, such as financial problems, relationship break-up or chronic pain and illness.In addition, experiencing conflict, disaster, violence, abuse, or loss and a sense of isolation are strongly associated with suicidal behaviour. Suicide rates are also high amongst vulnerable groups who experience discrimination, such as refugees and migrants; indigenous peoples; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex (LGBTI) persons; and prisoners. By far the strongest risk factor for suicide is a previous suicide attempt.Methods of suicideIt is estimated that around 30% of global suicides are due to pesticide self-poisoning, most of which occur in rural agricultural areas in low- and middle-income countries. Other common methods of suicide are hanging and firearms.Knowledge of the most commonly used suicide methods is important to devise prevention strategies which have shown to be effective, such as restriction of access to means of suicide.Prevention and controlSuicides are preventable. There are a number of measures that can be taken at population, sub-population and individual levels to prevent suicide and suicide attempts. These include:reducing access to the means of suicide (e.g. pesticides, firearms, certain medications);reporting by media in a responsible way;introducing alcohol policies to reduce the harmful use of alcohol;early identification, treatment and care of people with mental and substance use disorders, chronic pain and acute emotional distress;training of non-specialized health workers in the assessment and management of suicidal behaviour;follow-up care for people who attempted suicide and provision of community support.Suicide is a complex issue and therefore suicide prevention efforts require coordination and collaboration among multiple sectors of society, including the health sector and other sectors such as education, labour, agriculture, business, justice, law, defense, politics, and the media. These efforts must be comprehensive and integrated as no single approach alone can make an impact on an issue as complex as suicide.Challenges and obstaclesStigma and tabooStigma, particularly surrounding mental disorders and suicide, means many people thinking of taking their own life or who have attempted suicide are not seeking help and are therefore not getting the help they need. The prevention of suicide has not been adequately addressed due to a lack of awareness of suicide as a major public health problem and the taboo in many societies to openly discuss it. To date, only a few countries have included suicide prevention among their health priorities and only 28 countries report having a national suicide prevention strategy.Raising community awareness and breaking down the taboo is important for countries to make progress in preventing suicide.Data qualityGlobally, the availability and quality of data on suicide and suicide attempts is poor. Only 60 Member States have good-quality vital registration data that can be used directly to estimate suicide rates. This problem of poor-quality mortality data is not unique to suicide, but given the sensitivity of suicide – and the illegality of suicidal behaviour in some countries – it is likely that under-reporting and misclassification are greater problems for suicide than for most other causes of death.Improved surveillance and monitoring of suicide and suicide attempts is required for effective suicide prevention strategies. Cross-national differences in the patterns of suicide, and changes in the rates, characteristics and methods of suicide highlight the need for each country to improve the comprehensiveness, quality and timeliness of their suicide-related data. This includes vital registration of suicide, hospital-based registries of suicide attempts and nationally representative surveys collecting information about self-reported suicide attempts.WHO responseWHO recognizes suicide as a public health priority. The first WHO World Suicide Report “Preventing suicide: a global imperative” published in 2014, aims to increase the awareness of the public health significance of suicide and suicide attempts and to make suicide prevention a high priority on the global public health agenda. It also aims to encourage and support countries to develop or strengthen comprehensive suicide prevention strategies in a multisectoral public health approach.Suicide is one of the priority conditions in the WHO Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP) launched in 2008, which provides evidence-based technical guidance to scale up service provision and care in countries for mental, neurological and substance use disorders. In the WHO Mental Health Action Plan 2013-2020, WHO Member States have committed themselves to working towards the global target of reducing the suicide rate in countries by 10% by 2020. \n",

      "Mpox (monkeypox) is a viral illness caused by the monkeypox virus, a species of the genus Orthopoxvirus. Two different clades exist: clade I and clade II\n",
      "Common symptoms of mpox are a skin rash or mucosal lesions which can last 2–4 weeks accompanied by fever, headache, muscle aches, back pain, low energy, and swollen lymph nodes.\n",
      "Mpox can be transmitted to humans through physical contact with someone who is infectious, with contaminated materials, or with infected animals.\n",
      "Laboratory confirmation of mpox is done by testing skin lesion material by PCR.\n",
      "Mpox is treated with supportive care. Vaccines and therapeutics developed for smallpox and approved for use in some countries can be used for mpox in some circumstances.\n",
      "In 2022–2023 a global outbreak of mpox was caused by a strain known as clade IIb.\n",
      "Mpox can be prevented by avoiding physical contact with someone who has mpox. Vaccination can help prevent infection for people at risk.\n",

      "\n",
      "Person-to-person transmission of mpox can occur through direct contact with infectious skin or other lesions such as in the mouth or on genitals; this includes contact which is face-to-face (talking or breathing)skin-to-skin (touching or vaginal/anal sex)mouth-to-mouth (kissing)mouth-to-skin contact (oral sex or kissing the skin)respiratory droplets or short-range aerosols from prolonged close contact The virus then enters the body through broken skin, mucosal surfaces (e g oral, pharyngeal, ocular, genital, anorectal), or via the respiratory tract. Mpox can spread to other members of the household and to sex partners. People with multiple sexual partners are at higher risk.Animal to human transmission of mpox occurs from infected animals to humans from bites or scratches, or during activities such as hunting, skinning, trapping, cooking, playing with carcasses, or eating animals. The extent of viral circulation in animal populations is not entirely known and further studies are underway. People can contract mpox from contaminated objects such as clothing or linens, through sharps injuries in health care, or in community setting such as tattoo parlours.\n",

      "Identifying mpox can be difficult as other infections and conditions can look similar. It is important to distinguish mpox from chickenpox, measles, bacterial skin infections, scabies, herpes, syphilis, other sexually transmissible infections, and medication-associated allergies. Someone with mpox may also have another sexually transmissible infection such as herpes. Alternatively, a child with suspected mpox may also have chickenpox. For these reasons, testing is key for people to get treatment as early as possible and prevent further spread. Detection of viral DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the preferred laboratory test for mpox. The best diagnostic specimens are taken directly from the rash – skin, fluid or crusts – collected by vigorous swabbing. In the absence of skin lesions, testing can be done on oropharyngeal, anal or rectal swabs. Testing blood is not recommended. Antibody detection methods may not be useful as they do not distinguish between different orthopoxviruses.More information on laboratory confirmation of mpox can be found here.\n",

      "The goal of treating mpox is to take care of the rash, manage pain and prevent complications. Early and supportive care is important to help manage symptoms and avoid further problems.Getting an mpox vaccine can help prevent infection. The vaccine should be given within 4 days of contact with someone who has mpox (or within up to 14 days if there are no symptoms). It is recommended for people at high risk to get vaccinated to prevent infection with mpox, especially during an outbreak. This includes:health workers at risk of exposuremen who have sex with menpeople with multiple sex partnerssex workers.Persons who have mpox should be cared for away from other people.Several antivirals, such as tecovirimat, originally developed to treat smallpox have been used to treat mpox and further studies are underway.

      "Most people with mpox will recover within 2–4 weeks. Things to do to help the symptoms and prevent infecting others:Dostay home and in your own room if possiblewash hands often with soap and water or hand sanitizer, especially before or after touching soreswear a mask and cover lesions when around other people until your rash healskeep skin dry and uncovered (unless in a room with someone else)avoid touching items in shared spaces and disinfect shared spaces frequently use saltwater rinses for sores in the mouthtake sitz baths or warm baths with baking soda or Epsom salts for body sorestake over-the-counter medications for pain like paracetamol (acetaminophen) or ibuprofen.Do notpop blisters or scratch sores, which can slow healing, spread the rash to other parts of the body, and cause sores to become infected; orshave areas with sores until scabs have healed and you have new skin underneath (this can spread the rash to other parts of the body).To prevent spread of mpox to others, persons with mpox should isolate at home, or in hospital if needed, for the duration of the infectious period (from onset of symptoms until lesions have healed and scabs fall off). Covering lesions and wearing a medical mask when in the presence of others may help prevent spread. Using condoms during sex will help reduce the risk getting mpox but will not prevent spread from skin-to-skin or mouth-to-skin contact.\n",

Since 2013, the World Health Organization (WHO) has verified three countries in Latin America as free of human onchocerciasis.Whilst nodulectomy and vector control have been implemented in the past, the current intervention strategy is based on mass drug administration (MDA) of ivermectin. In Africa, annual community-directed treatment with ivermectin is the main intervention in most areas except in a few foci where semi-annual treatment is implemented. In the Americas, semi-annual ivermectin treatment with a minimum coverage of 85% is the main intervention; recently, quarterly treatment has been implemented in some foci.Guidelines for stopping mass drug administration and verifying elimination of human onchocerciasis\n",

      "Brazzaville, 17 December 2014 - According to a new WHO report, one third of all neonatal deaths occur in the African Region. Approximately three quarters of these deaths occur during the first week of life and almost half within the first 24 hours. The first 28 days of life, called the neonatal period, is a very risky period for babies. For every newborn baby that dies, another 20 will face illness or disability from conditions such as birth injury, infection, the inability to breathe normally after birth, neonatal tetanus, congenital anomalies, and the complications of premature birth.Too many babies are also being born to mothers who have not had adequate nutrition and antenatal care during pregnancy and who were not given skilled care during the birthing process. These mothers are at the greatest risk of dying during or after delivery – leaving newborns at an even greater risk of dying from inadequate care and suboptimal feeding practices.According to statistics, quality care with simple, accessible, cost–effective interventions can prevent up to two thirds of all neonatal deaths. One method that has worked to reduce neonatal deaths in the African Region is kangaroo mother care (KMC). KMC is caring for preterm infants by carrying the baby skin-to-skin, usually by the mother. “Essential interventions that contribute towards improving the survival of newborn babies include skilled care during the time of delivery where resuscitation can be performed, if required, exclusive breastfeeding, kangaroo mother care for preterm and low-birth weight babies, and the prevention and treatment of infections,” said Dr Tigest Ketsela Mengestu, Director of the Health Promotion Cluster of the World Health Organization Regional Office for Africa.Using KMC to care for stable preterm babies has been especially beneficial in resource-poor settings. It has been shown to reduce mortality among preterm babies (< 2000 g) in hospitals by 51% if started in the first week of life compared with incubator care.Malawi is a prime example of where KMC has been successfully used in health care settings. It’s been reported that deaths of newborn babies have been reduced from 40 deaths per 1000 live births in 2000 to 24 deaths per 1000 live births in 2012. Malawi is one of the few countries in the Region that has already achieved its 2015 Millennium Development Goal 4 targets.Another key to success in an African context is boosting community involvement. Many people do not go to a health care facility when they need care. Improving the quality of care at health facilities alone would not reduce neonatal and child mortality rates significantly. One way to improve this is to deliver more services through community providers. Community health workers (CHWs) are examples of community providers. They are trained to visit pregnant women at home to educate mothers about nutrition, breastfeeding, prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV, and on-going care requirements.CHWs also play an important role in saving the lives of newborns through home visits during the postnatal period. This allows them to review the health of the newborn and the mother, and to connect them to appropriate health care services.There is an urgent and on-going need for newborn health to be placed high on the global political agenda. Strong political commitments, the allocation of adequate resources, and the scaling up of a few known cost-effective interventions will save many newborn lives._________________________________________________ For additional information:Technical contact:Dr Assumpta MuriithiTel: +472 413 9212Email: muriithia@who.intMedia contacts:Cory CouillardTel: +472 413 9995E-mail: couillardc@who.intCollins Boakye-AgyemangTel: + 472 413 9420E-mail: boakyeagyemangc@who.int\n",

      "Brazzaville, 12 January 2015 – Every day an estimated 8000 children die in sub-Saharan Africa from easily preventable or treatable illnesses. Breastfeeding is one of the best ways to provide newborns, infants and young children with the nutrients that they need while protecting them against conditions such as pneumonia, diarrhoea, and measles.The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends exclusive breastfeeding that starts within one hour after birth and lasts until a baby is six months old. Continued breastfeeding and appropriate complementary foods should be made available for up to two years of age and beyond.In mid-2013,WHO issued new guidelines for breastfeeding and the prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV. These recommendations were intended for use in resource-poor settings in low-and middle-income countries.A mother can pass the HIV infection during pregnancy, delivery and through breastfeeding. In some African counties, it is estimated that 20 to 30% of pregnant women are infected with HIV and transmission rates from mother-to-child range from 25 to 40%. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) can significantly reduce the risk of transmission.  “One of the new recommendations for PMTCT is to promote the use of ART in all pregnant and breastfeeding women. These new recommendations also include providing ART - irrespective of one’s CD4 count - to all children with HIV under 5 years of age, all pregnant, and all breastfeeding women with HIV,” said Dr Tigest Ketsela Mengestu, Director of the Health Promotion Cluster of the World Health Organization Regional Office for Africa.To encourage people to do this and to make testing services more widely available, WHO (HQ, Regional and country-level) have worked together with partner organizations to adapt, disseminate and implement these new guidelines in countries.At least 90% of people living with HIV/AIDS across the African Region do not know that they are HIV positive, and HIV tests are often expensive and not always available to pregnant or breastfeeding mothers and children. More women and children are being encouraged to come forward to be tested for HIV as services become more readily available.In sub-Saharan Africa, health systems are fragile and staffing is often grossly inadequate to meet rising health needs. Community health workers (CHWs) often play an important role in educating mothers about nutrition, breastfeeding, PMTCT of HIV, and on-going care requirements.CHWs also save the lives of newborns through home visits during the postnatal period. This allows them to review the health of the newborn and the mother, and to connect them to appropriate health care services, wherever there is a need.While progress has been made in promoting breastfeeding in the African Region, significant challenges remain. Africa is a vast continent containing extremes of poverty and wealth. Undernutrition is still the most important underlying factor causing high infant and child mortality in the Region.In order to improve infant and child health and kick off the post-2015 development agenda, governments in the Region need to expand the use of safe breastfeeding. In 2012, the World Health Assembly, the decision-making body of WHO set the target of increasing the percentage of exclusive breastfeeding from 37% to at least 50% by 2025.______________________________________For more information, please contact:• Technical contacts:Dr Adelheid Werimo OnyangoTel: +472 413 9743Email: onyangoa@who.intDr Phanuel HabimanaTel: +472 413 9407Email: habimanap@who.int• Media contacts:Cory CouillardTel: + 472 413 9995E-mail: couillardc@who.intCollins Boakye-AgyemangTel: + 472 413 9420E-mail: boakyeagyemangc@who.int\n",

      "Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) along with mental health, cause nearly three-quarters of deaths in the world. In 2019, NCDs caused 41 million deaths globally, a number which is expected to increase due to increasing population, especially the population of older adults.Of the ten leading causes of death globally, seven are NCDs: ischaemic heart disease, strokes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer, dementias, diabetes, and kidney diseases; together these causes of death comprise 74% of deaths globally. At the same time however, all countries have achieved a reduction of the likelihood of premature death from NCDs. NCDs disproportionately affect people in low- and middle-income countries, where more than three-fourths of global NCD deaths (31.4 million) occur.In the WHO African Region, NCDs are increasingly becoming the main cause of mortality, and were responsible for 37% of deaths in 2019, rising from 24% in 2000. Of crucial significance is also the mental health burden in the region, with mental, neurological, and substance use disorders accounting for over 6% of the total disability-adjusted life years burden, representing more than 116 million individuals.Cardiovascular diseases are the most frequent causes of NCDs deaths, responsible for approximately 13% of all deaths and 37% of all NCDs deaths in Africa. In 2020, there were around 1.1 million new cancer cases and 700,000 deaths in Africa. Africa accounts for 5.7 % of global cancer incidence but has a larger share of deaths, at more than 7 %. Cancer death rates in Africa are projected to exceed the global average by 30% in the next 20 years. The most common cancers in adults include breast (16.5%) and cervical (13.1%). There were 24 million people with diabetes in 2021. The total number of people with diabetes in the region is predicted to increase by 129% to 55 million by 2045.Furthermore, Sickle Cell Disease, a genetic disease which causes high mortality rates in babies and children under the age of five, and significant morbidity and mortality in adults continues to be a major public health concern in the region. It is estimated that of the 300,000 to 400,000 newborns each year worldwide with SCD, 75% are born in Africa.Other NCDs also cause significant disease burdens. These include vision impairment and blindness, oral diseases, and ear conditions. For example, 44% of the African region population suffer from oral diseases, including noma, while 111 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa alone have a form of vision impairment and 40 million (19% of the total population) people have disabling hearing loss.\n",

      "Modifiable behavioral risk factorsModifiable behaviours, such as tobacco use, physical inactivity, unhealthy diets and the harmful use of alcohol, all increase the risk of NCDs.Tobacco accounts for over 8 million global deaths every year (including from the effects of exposure to second-hand smoke).1.8 million annual global deaths have been attributed to excess salt/sodium intake.More than half of the 3 million annual global deaths attributable to alcohol use are from NCDs, including cancer.830 000 global deaths annually can be attributed to insufficient physical activity. Metabolic risk factorsMetabolic risk factors contribute to four key metabolic changes that increase the risk of NCDs:raised blood pressure;overweight/obesity;hyperglycemia (high blood glucose levels); andhyperlipidemia (high levels of fat in the blood).In terms of attributable deaths, the leading metabolic risk factor globally is elevated blood pressure (to which 19% of global deaths are attributed), followed by raised blood glucose and overweight and obesity.Environmental risk factorsSeveral environmental risk factors contribute to NCDs. Air pollution is the largest of these, accounting for 6.7 million deaths globally, of which about 5.7 million are due to NCDs, including stroke, ischaemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung cancer.\n",

      " Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are becoming the leading cause of mortality in sub-Saharan Africa.Among these NCDs, chronic and severe NCDs like type 1 diabetes (T1D), acute rheumatic fever (ARF), rheumatic heart disease (RHD), and sickle cell disease (SCD) more frequently affect children and young adults. Early diagnosis, treatment, and care are critical to reducing the high mortality and morbidity that arise from these conditions. Factors that drive poor outcomes from these conditions include low awareness of the conditions at individual and community levels; poor access to services; health system weakness across all six pillars of the WHO health systems building blocks[1]; and poor resource allocation, including prioritization of service delivery from bilateral and multilateral partners and donors[2].There are renewed regional and global opportunities to reduce the burden of chronic, severe, and other NCDs in the African region. For example, the regional framework for integrating essential NCD services in primary health care (PHC) was adopted during the 67th Regional Committee (RC) in the WHO African Region, which aims at guiding Member States on the integration of essential NCD interventions in PHC in order to scale up early detection, diagnosis, and treatment. Moreover, as part of efforts to reduce the high burden of premature mortality from chronic and severe NCDs within the context of universal health coverage (UHC), \"PEN-Plus – A regional strategy to address severe chronic noncommunicable diseases at first level health facilities\" was adopted at the 72nd RC in 2022. This strategy aims to improve access to prevention, treatment, and care for chronic and severe NCDs to rural and peri-urban populations by providing this care at first-level referral facilities, using standardized protocol-based management. The strategy sets out clear activities which, if implemented, would strengthen the capacity for comprehensive care for chronic and severe NCDs, as well as strengthen the implementation of the WHO package of essential noncommunicable (PEN).It is in this context, with the financial support from the Hemsley Charitable Trust (HCT), the WHO Regional Office for Africa (AFRO) has initiated a three-year project in June 2023, to strengthen the implementation of the PEN-Plus Regional Strategy and thus ensure integrated prevention and control of chronic and severe NCDs in the WHO African Region, using T1D, SCD, ARF, and RHD as entry points.This project contributes to the attainment of the SDG target 3.4 on NCD premature mortality reduction by strengthening the implementation of an integrated care delivery strategy among Africa's poorest children and young adults by increasing access to quality diagnosis, treatment, and care among rural and peri-urban populations.This project consists of four pillars, with support of 20 PEN-Plus priority countries, including:engage for enhanced awareness of the PEN-Plus strategy, including organizing the annual PEN-Plus conferenceassess and prioritize evidence-based actiondrive improved disease managementmonitor and evaluate performance through results[1] World Health Organization (WHO).

      "With support from Roche, AFRO launched an initiative in September 2023 to support better access to breast and cervical cancer detection, treatment and care services in Cote d’Ivoire, Kenya and Zimbabwe. Breast and cervical cancer currently constitute over half the cancer burden for women in sub-Saharan Africa. Between 60%–70% of women in African countries are diagnosed at a late stage, and only one in two women diagnosed with breast cancer in an African country will survive five years. Breast cancer five-year survival rates in high-income countries exceed 90%.The initiative in the three countries includes health promotion, screening, early diagnosis and treatment, as well as general primary care and screening for other noncommunicable diseases. In addition, early detection services will be integrated into existing cervical cancer screening clinics to ensure both old and new systems are unified. The aim is to provide an integrated and holistic system of health care that will contribute to addressing the burden of breast and cervical cancer in the African Region.The new initiative being rolled out in the three countries seeks to increase health care worker’s ability to provide cancer care within communities through training and will supply and deliver the necessary equipment and essential supplies to support women at primary health care level.\n",

      "A profound shift from communicable to noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) is under way in many parts of the African Region. Globally, NCDs are estimated to kill 38 million people each year and they threaten progress towards the UN Millennium Development Goals and influence the post-2015 development agenda.The four main types of NCDs are cardiovascular diseases (like heart attacks and stroke), cancers, chronic respiratory diseases (such as chronic obstructed pulmonary disease and asthma) and diabetes.The trend towards a unhealthy diet rich in saturated fat, sugar and salt and poor in fruit and vegetables means that children in sub-Saharan Africa are overweight but malnourished because they are receiving more than enough calories but not enough necessary nutrients to grow into healthy adults.Malnutrition – including undernutrition and nutritional deficiencies – are still major causes of death and disease, especially among vulnerable and socially disadvantaged people like women and children less than five years of age.To help address these challenges, Uganda recently hosted the Regional Meeting on Accelerating Nutrition Improvements (ANI) in Africa. ANI aims to strengthen nutrition surveillance and scale up activities that will provide indirect benefit to 66 million women of reproductive age and 46 million children less than five years of age in sub-Saharan Africa.Opening the meeting, Uganda’s Director General of Health Services Dr Jane Ruth Aceng underscored the centrality of nutrition in health care delivery noting that \"nutrition is a social and economic determinant of health that must be always be prioritized\".Dr Mercy Chikoko, ANI coordinator at the WHO Regional Office for Africa, highlighted that all stakeholders need to be accountable for framing policies and implementing programmes that will effectively reduce preventable risks to health. Evaluation, monitoring and surveillance are essential components of such actions.The WHO Representative for Uganda, Dr Wondimagegnehu Alemu commended Uganda for tackling nutrition at the highest level and for prioritizing nutrition. “Malnutrition is a public health concern in sub-Saharan Africa that calls for urgent actions and interventions such as ANI”, he said.Echoing the same sentiments, Dr Francesco Branca, Director of Nutrition for Health and Development at WHO/HQ, appreciated the concerted efforts of the different countries to improve nutrition. He highlighted the burden of undernutrition in counties and appreciated Africa for taking the initiative to address the problems.Overall, the delegates emphasized the need for capacity building in districts, province or regions to be able to assess, analyze and use information for decision-making, planning and implementation of nutrition programs. The delegates were nutrition experts from WHO and governments of Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Mali, Zimbabwe, Uganda, Senegal, Tanzania, Mozambique and Sierra Leone.Dietary habits are often rooted in local and regional traditions. National strategies need to be culturally appropriate and be able to challenge cultural influences and to respond to changes over time. Dietary recommendations include the following:achieve energy balance and a healthy weightlimit energy intake from total fats and shift fat consumption away from saturated fats to unsaturated fats and towards the elimination of trans-fatty acidsincrease consumption of fruits and vegetables, and legumes, whole grains and nutslimit the intake of free sugarslimit salt (sodium) consumption from all sources and ensure that salt is iodized.For implementing the ANI project, WHO is closely working with partner agencies, including UN agencies, Renewed Efforts Against Child Hunger and undernutrition (REACH), Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN), USAID, and various nongovernmental organizations and efforts are supported by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade Development of the Government of Canada (DFATD).For more information, please contact:Technical contacts:Dr Mercy Chikoko, Tel: +472 413 9380; Email: chikokom@who.int Dr Pricilla Ravonimanantsoa, Tel: +256031335555; Email: ravonimanantsoap@who.intMedia contacts:Dr Cory Couillard, Tel: +472 413 9995; Email: couillardc@who.int  \n",

      "Juba, 30 March 2017 - The World Health Organization (WHO) continues to scale up its response to reduce preventable deaths and diseases, and provide health services in famine-affected areas of South Sudan. In February 2017, famine was declared in the former Unity State, where 100 000 people face starvation and another 1 million are on the brink of famine.The total number of food insecure people is expected to rise to 5.5 million at the height of the lean season in July if nothing is done to curb the severity and spread of the food crisis. Children are particularly vulnerable to malnourishment in times of famine. In Unity State, an estimated 270 000 children and 350 000 women are affected by severe acute malnutrition.“A malnourished child is a sick child, and if you only give them food, they will die as they need both food and care,” said Dr Abdulmumini Usman, the WHO Representative to South Sudan. “Sadly, by the time a famine is declared, it is too late for thousands of people.”  Health is an essential part of the famine response.. Those who are malnourished are also more likely to get sick and are more likely to be affected during disease outbreaks; and when they get sick they are more likely to die.Acute malnutrition weakens the immune system, which makes affected children, lactating/pregnant mothers and people with underlying medical conditions more susceptible to killer diseases such as measles, malaria, pneumonia and deterioration in the existing underlying medical conditions. Globally, undernutrition is an underlying factor in more than half of child deaths from pneumonia and malaria, and more than 40% of measles deaths.WHO has a team of more than 350 people based in South Sudan who have worked closely with the Ministry of Health for many years. The team in South Sudan has been responding to this crisis for months. However, South Sudan is a country dealing with multiple crises and challenges, including conflict and weak health infrastructure, which make it a particularly challenging place to operate and obtain results.WHO has worked closely with Health Cluster partners in famine-affected areas in former Unity State, especially in Leer, Koch and Mayendit Counties, to deliver much needed health assistance, especially during the recent cholera outbreak that continues. In 2017, WHO supported a cholera vaccination campaign, including in famine-affected areas, and provided 69 000 doses of oral cholera vaccine to Unity State. Later this year, WHO will support a nationwide measles campaign, including famine-affected areas.Surge support to fortify WHO’s famine responseTo help respond effectively to the emergency, WHO is in the midst of deploying additional personnel with specific emergency response experiences, such as on coordination, disease surveillance and information management, and additional resources, such as medicines and kits to help treat  medical complications of severe acute malnutrition.“We want to focus our efforts on increasing access to essential health and nutritional services, plus strengthening disease surveillance and data collection,” said Dr Solomon Woldetsadik, WHO Incident Manager for the famine response. “If you can’t see where the outbreaks are happening, you can’t effectively target your response and treat the people.”WHO's immediate priorities will be to prevent and control disease outbreaks, such as cholera, measles, malaria and polio, improve emergency health services delivery, strengthening coordination between the Government and partners at local, state and national levels, utilizing data and information to provide a more targeted response, and looking at ways to ensure resilience for service delivery in the future.WHO requires additional funding, and currently expects the response in South Sudan to cost US$ 20.1 million, but has only received US$ 2.1 million so far. South Sudan’s Health Cluster, including WHO, is seeking US$ 145 million for 2017. Funding needs may rise as the crisis evolves. \n",

      "New data released today by the Ministry of Health and Sanitation and WHO shows that community engagement efforts reached more than 20,950 households over seven months in 2016, approximately 117,000* people,  through community meetings, events, door to door visits and vibrant peer support groups.Since the Ebola outbreak, the Ministry of Health and Sanitation supported by WHO has prioritized community engagement as a major instrument in the fight to improve health outcomes in Sierra Leone. This includes support for communities to prevent, detect and manage diseases, but also substantive drives to improve child and maternal health. In particular, engagement efforts have focused on promoting delivery at health facilities and antenatal care; immunization uptake; disease surveillance and response; good nutrition, and trust and use of clinics for diagnosis and treatment.From April to November 2016, 14,800 pregnant women were reached with messages and information on antenatal care and institutional deliveries, both critical interventions towards reducing Sierra Leone’s high numbers of maternal and infant deaths, and 8,000 mothers participated in innovative Mothers’ Support Clubs. These clubs have mobilized ‘Lead Mothers’ to monitor children for malnourishment and stunting and engaged them as peer educators on nutrition. School health clubs have also rallied young people to talk to their peers about issues that affect their health, from STIs to disease prevention and NCDs, while husbands, domestic partners and community leadership have been engaged as champions and supporters of activities towards maternal and child health and disease prevention and response.Sandra Miatta Sesay says that these campaigns have made a remarkable difference for public health in her community of Kpapei, a rural farming village in Moyamba District. She is a Lead Mother in a Mother’s Support Group where a large group of women have now been trained in nutrition. “We talk to pregnant women about what to eat; we talk to mothers about what and when to feed the children, and we talk about breastfeeding for the first six months.” She adds that the process has enabled women to take charge of their health and that of their family.  “In the past some people were not really understanding the importance of breastfeeding and they used to give the children water in the first six months which made them get sick. Today people are really practicing exclusive breastfeeding and our children are doing very well and are strong.”With support from the Ministry and other health partners, experiences like these show that knowledge, education and community engagement have a very vital role to play in improving health outcomes in Sierra Leone and tackling some of the country’s most pressing health challenges.Download the data here. *Based on an average household size of 5.6 (2015 Housing and Population Census) \n",

It is defined as a person's weight in kilograms divided by the square of his height in meters (kg/m2).AdultsFor adults, WHO defines overweight and obesity as follows:overweight is a BMI greater than or equal to 25; andobesity is a BMI greater than or equal to 30.BMI provides the most useful population-level measure of overweight and obesity as it is the same for both sexes and for all ages of adults. However, it should be considered a rough guide because it may not correspond to the same degree of fatness in different individuals.For children, age needs to be considered when defining overweight and obesity.Children under 5 years of ageFor children under 5 years of age:overweight is weight-for-height greater than 2 standard deviations above WHO Child Growth Standards median; andobesity is weight-for-height greater than 3 standard deviations above the WHO Child Growth Standards median.Charts and tables: WHO child growth standards for children aged under 5 yearsChildren aged between 5–19 yearsOverweight and obesity are defined as follows for children aged between 5–19 years:overweight is BMI-for-age greater than 1 standard deviation above the WHO Growth Reference median; andobesity is greater than 2 standard deviations above the WHO Growth Reference median.Charts and tables: WHO growth reference for children aged between 5–19 years\n",

Of these over 600 million adults were obese.Overall, about 13% of the world’s adult population (11% of men and 15% of women) were obese in 2014.In 2014, 39% of adults aged 18 years and over (38% of men and 40% of women) were overweight.The worldwide prevalence of obesity more than doubled between 1980 and 2014.In 2014, an estimated 41 million children under the age of 5 years were overweight or obese. Once considered a high-income country problem, overweight and obesity are now on the rise in low- and middle-income countries, particularly in urban settings. In Africa, the number of children who are overweight or obese has nearly doubled from 5.4 million in 1990 to 10.6 million in 2014. Nearly half of the children under 5 who were overweight or obese in 2014 lived in Asia.Overweight and obesity are linked to more deaths worldwide than underweight.

At the same time, these children are exposed to high-fat, high-sugar, high-salt, energy-dense, and micronutrient-poor foods, which tend to be lower in cost but also lower in nutrient quality. These dietary patterns, in conjunction with lower levels of physical activity, result in sharp increases in childhood obesity while undernutrition issues remain unsolved.\n",

      "Overweight and obesity, as well as their related noncommunicable diseases, are largely preventable. Supportive environments and communities are fundamental in shaping people’s choices, by making the choice of healthier foods and regular physical activity the easiest choice (the choice that is the most accessible, available and affordable), and therefore preventing overweight and obesity.At the individual level, people can:limit energy intake from total fats and sugars;increase consumption of fruit and vegetables, as well as legumes, whole grains and nuts; andengage in regular physical activity (60 minutes a day for children and 150 minutes spread through the week for adults).Individual responsibility can only have its full effect where people have access to a healthy lifestyle. Therefore, at the societal level it is important to support individuals in following the recommendations above, through sustained implementation of evidence based and population based policies that make regular physical activity and healthier dietary choices available, affordable and easily accessible to everyone, particularly to the poorest individuals. An example of such a policy is a tax on sugar sweetened beverages.The food industry can play a significant role in promoting healthy diets by:reducing the fat, sugar and salt content of processed foods;ensuring that healthy and nutritious choices are available and affordable to all consumers;restricting marketing of foods high in sugars, salt and fats, especially those foods aimed at children and teenagers; andensuring the availability of healthy food choices and supporting regular physical activity practice in the workplace.\n",

The Strategy calls upon all stakeholders to take action at global, regional and local levels to improve diets and physical activity patterns at the population level.The Political Declaration of the High Level Meeting of the United Nations General Assembly on the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases of September 2011, recognizes the critical importance of reducing unhealthy diet and physical inactivity. The political declaration commits to advancing the implementation of the \"WHO Global Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity and Health\", including, where appropriate, through the introduction of policies and actions aimed at promoting healthy diets and increasing physical activity in the entire population.WHO has also developed the \"Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases 2013-2020\" which aims to achieve the commitments of the UN Political Declaration on Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) which was endorsed by Heads of State and Government in September 2011. The “Global Action Plan” will contribute to progress on 9 global NCD targets to be attained by 2025, including a 25% relative reduction in premature mortality from NCDs by 2025 and a halt in the rise of global obesity to match the rates of 2010.In 2016 the World Health Assembly welcomed the report of the Commission on Ending Childhood Obesity and its 6 recommendations to address the obesogenic environment and critical periods in the life course to tackle childhood obesity. The Assembly requested the Director-General to develop an implementation plan to guide further action.\n",

      "Onchocerciasis, commonly known as “river blindness”, is caused by the parasitic worm Onchocerca volvulus.\n",
      "It is transmitted to humans through exposure to repeated bites of infected blackflies of the genus Simulium.\n",
      "Symptoms include severe itching, disfiguring skin conditions, and visual impairment, including permanent blindness.\n",
      "More than 99% of infected people live in 31 African countries. The disease also exists in some foci in Latin America and Yemen.\n",
      "Community-directed treatment with ivermectin is the core strategy to eliminate onchocerciasis in Africa. In the Americas the strategy is biannual large-scale treatment with ivermectin.\n",
      "In July 2016, Guatemala became the fourth country in the world after Colombia (2013), Ecuador (2014), and Mexico (2015) to be verified free of onchocerciasis after successfully implementing elimination activities for decades.\n",

These blackflies breed in fast-flowing rivers and streams, mostly in remote villages located near fertile land where people rely on agriculture.\n",
      "In the human body, the adult worms produce embryonic larvae (microfilariae) that migrate to the skin, eyes and other organs. When a female blackfly bites an infected person during a blood meal, it also ingests microfilariae which develop further in the blackfly and are then transmitted to the next human host during subsequent bites.\n",

      "There is no vaccine or medication to prevent infection with O. volvulus.Between 1974 and 2002, disease caused by onchocerciasis was brought under control in West Africa through the work of the Onchocerciasis Control Programme (OCP), using mainly the spraying of insecticides against blackfly larvae (vector control) by helicopters and airplanes. This has been supplemented by large-scale distribution of ivermectin since 1989.The OCP relieved 40 million people from infection, prevented blindness in 600 000 people, and ensured that 18 million children were born free from the threat of the disease and blindness. In addition, 25 million hectares of abandoned arable land were reclaimed for settlement and agricultural production, capable of feeding 17 million people annually.The African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control (APOC) was launched in 1995 with the objective of controlling onchocerciasis in the remaining endemic countries in Africa and closed at the end of 2015 after beginning the transition to onchocerciasis elimination. Its main strategy has been the establishment of sustainable community-directed treatment with ivermectin (CDTI) and vector control with environmentally-safe methods where appropriate.In 2015, more than 114 million people were treated in in Africa where the strategy of CDTI was being implemented, representing approximately 60% coverage of the number of people who require treatment globally.After the closure of APOC, a new programme was launched in the African Region. The Expanded Special Project for the Elimination of Neglected Tropical Diseases in Africa (ESPEN) was officially launched at the World Health Assembly in May 2016. Among its many roles, it will initially focus on several priority countries to support their neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) programmes, including their onchocerciasis programmes, and will create a pool of experts that can provide technical assistance to all member countries. ESPEN, like OCP and APOC, is housed in the WHO Regional Office for Africa.The Onchocerciasis Elimination Program of the Americas (OEPA) began in 1992 with the objective of eliminating ocular morbidity and interruption of transmission throughout the Americas by 2015 through biannual large-scale treatment with ivermectin. All 13 foci in this region achieved coverage of more than 85% in 2006, and transmission was interrupted in 10 of the 13 foci by the end of 2011. At the end of 2016, 1 of the 3 remaining foci was undergoing post-treatment surveillance after having stopped ivermectin treatment and 2 foci remained under treatment. Elimination efforts are now focused on the Yanomami people living in Brazil and Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of).Following successful large-scale treatment of populations in affected areas with the support of international partners, Colombia and Ecuador were able to stop transmission of the disease in 2007 and 2009 respectively. Mexico and Guatemala were also able to stop transmission in 2011. Elimination efforts are now focused on the Yanomami people living in Brazil and Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of).On 5 April 2013, the Director-General of WHO issued an official letter confirming that Colombia has achieved elimination of onchocerciasis. Colombia was the first country in the world to be verified and declared free of onchocerciasis by WHO. This has been followed by Ecuador in September 2014, Mexico in July 2015, and Guatemala in July 2016.\n",

Noma is mostly prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa, but sporadic cases are also reported from other world regions. Noma starts as a soft tissue lesion (a sore) of the gums, inside the mouth. The initial gum lesion then develops into an ulcerative, necrotizing gingivitis that progresses rapidly, destroying the soft tissues and further progressing to involve the hard tissues and skin of the face.In 1998, WHO estimated that there were 140 000 new cases of noma annually. However, due to the lack of robust estimate and systematic reporting, the true global burden of noma and its distribution have been difficult to plot accurately. Without treatment, noma is fatal in 70 to 90% of cases. Where noma is detected at an early stage, its progression can be rapidly halted, through basic hygiene, antibiotics, and nutritional rehabilitation. Such early detection helps to prevent suffering, disability, and death. However, the great majority of affected communities in Africa are situated in peri-urban and rural areas where traditional beliefs and stigma are prevalent, and early detection, diagnosis and access to care are difficult. Survivors suffer from severe facial disfigurement, have difficulty speaking and eating, face social stigma, and require complex surgery and rehabilitation.\n",

      "People infected with plague usually develop “flu-like” symptoms after an incubation period of 3-7 days. Typical symptoms are the sudden onset of fever, chills, head and body-aches and weakness, vomiting and nausea.There are 3 forms of plague infection, depending on the route of infection: bubonic, septicaemic and pneumonic.Bubonic plague is the most common form of plague and is caused by the bite of an infected flea. Plague bacillus, Y. pestis, enters at the bite and travels through the lymphatic system to the nearest lymph node where it replicates itself. The lymph node then becomes inflamed, tense and painful, and is called a \"bubo\". At advanced stages of the infection the inflamed lymph nodes can turn into suppurating open sores. There is no inter human transmission of bubonic plague.Septicaemic plague occurs when infection spreads through the bloodstream Septicaemic plague may result from flea bites and from direct contact with infective materials through cracks in the skin. Advanced stages of the bubonic form of plague will also lead to direct spread of Y. pestis in the blood.Pneumonic plague-or lung-based plague- is the most virulent and least common form of plague. Typically, the pneumonic form is caused by spread to the lungs from advanced bubonic plague. However, a person with secondary pneumonic plague may form aerosolized infective droplets and transmit plague via droplets to other humans. Untreated pneumonic plague has a case-fatality ratio close to 100%.\n",

      "Rabies is an infectious viral disease that is almost always fatal following the onset of clinical symptoms. In up to 99% of cases, domestic dogs are responsible for rabies virus transmission to humans. Yet, rabies can affect both domestic and wild animals. It is spread to people through bites or scratches, usually via saliva.\n",
      "Rabies is present on all continents, except Antarctica, with over 95% of human deaths occurring in the Asia and Africa regions.\n",
      "Rabies is one of the neglected tropical diseases that predominantly affects poor and vulnerable populations who live in remote rural locations. Although effective human vaccines and immunoglobulins exist for rabies, they are not readily available or accessible to those in need. Globally, rabies deaths are rarely reported and children between the ages of 5–14 years are frequent victims. Treating a rabies exposure, where the average cost of rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is US$ 40 in Africa and US$ 49 in Asia, can be a catastrophic financial burden on affected families whose average daily income is around US$ 1–2 per person.\n",

      "Eliminating rabies in dogsRabies is a vaccine-preventable disease. Vaccinating dogs is the most cost-effective strategy for preventing rabies in people. Dog vaccination reduces deaths attributable to rabies and the need for PEP as a part of dog bite patient care.Awareness on rabies and preventing dog bitesEducation on dog behaviour and bite prevention for both children and adults is an essential extension of a rabies vaccination programme and can decrease both the incidence of human rabies and the financial burden of treating dog bites. Increasing awareness of rabies prevention and control in communities includes education and information on responsible pet ownership, how to prevent dog bites, and immediate care measures after a bite. Engagement and ownership of the programme at the community level increases reach and uptake of key messages.Preventive immunization in peopleHuman rabies vaccines exist for pre-exposure immunization. These are recommended for people in certain high-risk occupations such as laboratory workers handling live rabies and rabies-related (lyssavirus) viruses; and people (such as animal disease control staff and wildlife rangers) whose professional or personal activities might bring them into direct contact with bats, carnivores, or other mammals that may be infected.Pre-exposure immunization is also recommended for travellers to rabies-affected, remote areas who plan to spend a lot of time outdoors involved in activities such as caving or mountain-climbing. Expatriates and long-term travellers to areas with a high rabies exposure risk should be immunized if local access to rabies biologics is limited. Finally, immunization should also be considered for children living in, or visiting, remote, high-risk areas. As they play with animals, they may receive more severe bites, or may not report bites.\n",

      "The incubation period for rabies is typically 1–3 months but may vary from 1 week to 1 year, dependent upon factors such as the location of virus entry and viral load. Initial symptoms of rabies include a fever with pain and unusual or unexplained tingling, pricking, or burning sensation (paraesthesia) at the wound site. As the virus spreads to the central nervous system, progressive and fatal inflammation of the brain and spinal cord develops.There are two forms of the disease:People with furious rabies exhibit signs of hyperactivity, excitable behaviour, hydrophobia (fear of water) and sometimes aerophobia (fear of drafts or of fresh air). Death occurs after a few days due to cardio-respiratory arrest.Paralytic rabies accounts for about 30% of the total number of human cases. This form of rabies runs a less dramatic and usually longer course than the furious form. Muscles gradually become paralyzed, starting at the site of the bite or scratch. A coma slowly develops, and eventually death occurs. The paralytic form of rabies is often misdiagnosed, contributing to the under-reporting of the disease.\n",

Bat rabies is also an emerging public health threat in Australia and Western Europe. Human deaths following exposure to foxes, raccoons, skunks, jackals, mongooses and other wild carnivore host species are very rare, and bites from rodents are not known to transmit rabies.Transmission can also occur when infectious material – usually saliva – comes into direct contact with human mucosa or fresh skin wounds. Human-to-human transmission through bites is theoretically possible but has never been confirmed.Contraction of rabies through inhalation of virus-containing aerosols or through transplantation of infected organs is rare.

      "Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is the immediate treatment of a bite victim after rabies exposure. This prevents virus entry into the central nervous system, which results in imminent death. PEP consists of:extensive washing and local treatment of the wound as soon as possible after exposure;a course of potent and effective rabies vaccine that meets WHO standards; andthe administration of rabies immunoglobulin (RIG), if indicated.Effective treatment soon after exposure to rabies can prevent the onset of symptoms and death.Extensive wound washingThis involves first-aid of the wound that includes immediate and thorough flushing and washing of the wound for a minimum of 15 minutes with soap and water, detergent, povidone iodine or other substances that kill the rabies virus.Recommended PEPDepending on the severity of the contact with the suspected rabid animal, administration of PEP is recommended as follows (see table): Table: Categories of contact and recommended post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)         Categories of contact with suspect rabid animalPost-exposure prophylaxis measures    Category I – touching or feeding animals, licks on intact skinNone    Category II – nibbling of uncovered skin, minor scratches or abrasions without bleedingImmediate vaccination and local treatment of the wound    Category III – single or multiple transdermal bites or scratches, licks on broken skin; contamination of mucous membrane with saliva from licks, contacts with bats.Immediate vaccination and administration of rabies immunoglobulin; local treatment of the wound    All category II and III exposures assessed as carrying a risk of developing rabies require PEP. This risk is increased if:the biting mammal is a known rabies reservoir or vector speciesthe exposure occurs in a geographical area where rabies is still presentthe animal looks sick or displays abnormal behavioura wound or mucous membrane was contaminated by the animal’s salivathe bite was unprovokedthe animal has not been vaccinated.The vaccination status of the suspect animal should not be the deciding factor when considering to initiate PEP or not when the vaccination status of the animal is questionable. This can be the case if dog vaccination programmes are not being sufficiently regulated or followed out of lack of resources or low priority.WHO continues to promote human rabies prevention through the elimination of rabies in dogs, dog bite prevention strategies, and more widespread use of the intradermal route for PEP which reduces volume and therefore the cost of cell-cultured vaccine by 60% to 80%.\n",

Treatment may be discontinued if the animal is proven to be free of rabies. If a suspect animal cannot be captured and tested, then a full course of prophylaxis should be completed.\n",

      "Rabies is included in the neglected tropical disease roadmap of WHO. As a zoonotic disease, it requires close cross-sectoral coordination at the national, regional and global levels.Global level activitiesIn December 2015, a global framework to reach zero human rabies deaths by 2030 was launched by WHO and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), in collaboration with the Food and Agriculture Organization of United Nations (FAO) and the Global Alliance for Rabies Control. This initiative marks the first time that both the human and animal health sectors have come together to adopt a common strategy against this devastating and massively neglected disease.Monitoring and surveillance of the disease should be a central element of every rabies programme. Declaring a disease notifiable is crucial to establish functional reporting. This should include mechanisms for the transmission of data from the community level to the national level and on to the OIE and WHO. This will provide feedback on programme efficacy and allow for actions to be taken to improve areas of weakness.Share data for rabies with WHOStockpiles of dog and human rabies vaccines have had a catalytic effect on rabies elimination efforts. WHO, with partners, is working to forecast the global need for human and dog vaccines and rabies immunoglobulin, to understand the global manufacturing capacity and to explore bulk purchasing options for countries through WHO/UNICEF (human vaccine and RIG) and OIE/WHO (animal vaccine) mechanisms.In 2016, the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE), established a working group on rabies vaccines and immunoglobulins. The working group is currently reviewing the scientific evidence and the relevant programmatic considerations for their use and best vaccine regimens as well as evaluating the potential impact of new biologicals. The proposed recommendations resulting from this work will be considered by SAGE in October 2017 to update WHO’s position on rabies immunization.With the support of WHO, selected countries in Africa and Asia are conducting prospective and retrospective studies to gather data on dog bites and rabies cases, PEP treatment and follow-up, vaccine needs, and programme delivery options. This information will provide further evidence to support the need for investment in rabies programmes and will inform the vaccine investment strategy of the GAVI Alliance in 2018.Regional and country examplesSince 1983, countries in the Region of the Americas have reduced the incidence of rabies by over 95% in humans and 98% in dogs. This success has been achieved mainly through the implementation of effective policies and programmes that focus on regionally coordinated dog vaccination campaigns, raising public awareness, and widespread availability of PEP.Many countries in the WHO South-East Asia Region have embarked on rabies elimination campaigns in line with the target of regional elimination by 2020. Bangladesh launched an elimination programme in 2010 and, through the management of dog bites, mass dog vaccination, and increased availability of vaccines free of charge, human rabies deaths decreased by 50% between 2010–2013.Great strides have also been made in the Philippines, South Africa and Tanzania where proof of concept projects, as part of a Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation project led by WHO, recently showed that a reduction in human rabies cases is possible through a combination of interventions involving mass dog vaccination, improved access to PEP, increased surveillance and raising public awareness.The key towards sustaining, and expanding the rabies programmes to adjacent geographies has been to start small, catalyse local rabies programmes through stimulus packages, demonstrate success and cost-effectiveness, and ensure the engagement of the government and affected communities.WHO with its partners, FAO, OIE and the Global Alliance for Rabies Control is developing a costed action plan to reach zero human deaths by 2030. This plan covers policy, human and animal interventions, awareness raising and advocacy, capacity building, and the respective resources needed for elimination of the disease in countries still suffering from rabies.\n",

      "Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a viral zoonosis that primarily affects animals but also has the capacity to infect humans. Infection can cause severe disease in both animals and humans. The disease also results in significant economic losses due to death and abortion among RVF-infected livestock.RVF virus is a member of the Phlebovirus genus. The virus was first identified in 1931 during an investigation into an epidemic among sheep on a farm in the Rift Valley of Kenya.Since then, outbreaks have been reported in sub-Saharan Africa. In 1977 an explosive outbreak was reported in Egypt, the RVF virus was introduced to Egypt via infected livestock trade along the Nile irrigation system. In 1997–98, a major outbreak occurred in Kenya, Somalia and Tanzania following El Niño event and extensive flooding. Following infected livestock trade from the horn of Africa, RVF spread in September 2000 to Saudi Arabia and Yemen, marking the first reported occurrence of the disease outside the African continent and raising concerns that it could extend to other parts of Asia and Europe.\n",

      "The majority of human infections result from direct or indirect contact with the blood or organs of infected animals. The virus can be transmitted to humans through the handling of animal tissue during slaughtering or butchering, assisting with animal births, conducting veterinary procedures, or from the disposal of carcasses or fetuses. Certain occupational groups such as herders, farmers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians are therefore at higher risk of infection.The virus infects humans through inoculation, for example via a wound from an infected knife or through contact with broken skin, or through inhalation of aerosols produced during the slaughter of infected animals.There is some evidence that humans may become infected with RVF by ingesting the unpasteurized or uncooked milk of infected animals.Human infections have also resulted from the bites of infected mosquitoes, most commonly the Aedes and Culex mosquitoes and the transmission of RVF virus by hematophagous (blood-feeding) flies is also possible.To date, no human-to-human transmission of RVF has been documented, and no transmission of RVF to health care workers has been reported when standard infection control precautions have been put in place.There has been no evidence of outbreaks of RVF in urban areas.\n",

      "Mild form of RVF in humansThe following are clinical features of the mild form of RVF in humans:The incubation period (the interval from infection to onset of symptoms) for RVF varies from 2 to 6 days.Those infected either experience no detectable symptoms or develop a mild form of the disease characterized by a feverish syndrome with sudden onset of flu-like fever, muscle pain, joint pain and headache. Some patients develop neck stiffness, sensitivity to light, loss of appetite and vomiting; in these patients the disease, in its early stages, may be mistaken for meningitis.The symptoms of RVF usually last from 4 to 7 days, after which time the immune response becomes detectable with the appearance of antibodies and the virus disappears from the blood.Severe form of RVF in humansWhile most human cases are relatively mild, a small percentage of patients develop a much more severe form of the disease. This usually appears as 1 or more of 3 distinct syndromes: ocular (eye) disease (0.5–2% of patients), meningoencephalitis (less than 1% of patients) or haemorrhagic fever (less than 1% of patients).The following are clinical features of the severe form of RVF in humans:Ocular form: In this form of the disease, the usual symptoms associated with the mild form of the disease are accompanied by retinal lesions. The onset of the lesions in the eyes is usually 1 to 3 weeks after appearance of the first symptoms. Patients usually report blurred or decreased vision. The disease may resolve itself with no lasting effects within 10 to 12 weeks. However, when the lesions occur in the macula, 50% of patients will experience a permanent loss of vision. Death in patients with only the ocular form of the disease is uncommon.Meningoencephalitis form: The onset of the meningoencephalitis form of the disease usually occurs 1 to 4 weeks after the first symptoms of RVF appear. Clinical features include intense headache, loss of memory, hallucinations, confusion, disorientation, vertigo, convulsions, lethargy and coma. Neurological complications can appear later (after more than 60 days). The death rate in patients who experience only this form of the disease is low, although residual neurological deficit, which may be severe, is common.Haemorrhagic fever form: The symptoms of this form of the disease appear 2–4 days after the onset of illness, and begin with evidence of severe liver impairment, such as jaundice. Subsequently signs of haemorrhage then appear such as vomiting blood, passing blood in the faeces, a purpuric rash or ecchymoses (caused by bleeding in the skin), bleeding from the nose or gums, menorrhagia and bleeding from venepuncture sites. The case-fatality ratio for patients developing the haemorrhagic form of the disease is high at approximately 50%. Death usually occurs 3 to 6 days after the onset of symptoms. The virus may be detectable in the blood for up to 10 days, in patients with the hemorrhagic icterus form of RVF.The total case fatality rate has varied widely between different epidemics but, overall, has been less than 1% in those documented. Most fatalities occur in patients who develop the haemorrhagic icterus form.\n",

Sheep and goats appear to be more susceptible than cattle or camels.Age has also been shown to be a significant factor in the animal's susceptibility to the severe form of the disease: over 90% of lambs infected with RVF die, whereas mortality among adult sheep can be as low as 10%.The rate of abortion among pregnant infected ewes is almost 100%. An outbreak of RVF in animals frequently manifests itself as a wave of unexplained abortions among livestock and may signal the start of an epidemic.\n",

      "Several different species of mosquito are able to act as vectors for transmission of the RVF virus. The dominant vector species varies between different regions and different species can play different roles in sustaining the transmission of the virus.Among animals, the RVF virus is spread primarily by the bite of infected mosquitoes, mainly the Aedes species, which can acquire the virus from feeding on infected animals. The female mosquito is also capable of transmitting the virus directly to her offspring via eggs leading to new generations of infected mosquitoes hatching from eggs.However, when analysing RVF major outbreaks, 2 ecologically distinct situations should be considered. At primary foci areas, RVF virus persists through transmission between vectors and hosts and maintains through vertical transmission in Aedes mosquitoes. During major outbreak in primary foci, the disease can spread to secondary foci through livestock movement or passive mosquitoes dispersal and amplifies in naïve ruminants via local competent mosquitoes like Culex, Mansonia and Anopheles that act as mechanical vectors. Irrigation schemes, where populations of mosquitoes are abundant during long periods of the year, are highly favourable places for secondary disease transmission.\n",

      "\n",
      "Controlling RVF in animalsOutbreaks of RVF in animals can be prevented by a sustained programme of animal vaccination. Both modified live attenuated virus and inactivated virus vaccines have been developed for veterinary use. Only 1 dose of the live vaccine is required to provide long-term immunity but this vaccine may result in spontaneous abortion if given to pregnant animals. The inactivated virus vaccine does not have this side effect, but multiple doses are required in order to provide protection which may prove problematic in endemic areas.Animal immunization must be implemented prior to an outbreak if an epizootic is to be prevented. Once an outbreak has occurred animal vaccination should NOT be implemented because there is a high risk of intensifying the outbreak. During mass animal vaccination campaigns, animal health workers may, inadvertently, transmit the virus through the use of multi-dose vials and the re-use of needles and syringes. If some of the animals in the herd are already infected and viraemic (although not yet displaying obvious signs of illness), the virus will be transmitted among the herd, and the outbreak will be amplified.Restricting or banning the movement of livestock may be effective in slowing the expansion of the virus from infected to uninfected areas.As outbreaks of RVF in animals precede human cases, the establishment of an active animal health surveillance system to detect new cases is essential in providing early warning for veterinary and human public health authorities.Public health education and risk reductionDuring an outbreak of RVF, close contact with animals, particularly with their body fluids, either directly or via aerosols, has been identified as the most significant risk factor for RVF virus infection. Raising awareness of the risk factors of RVF infection as well as the protective measures individuals can take to prevent mosquito bites is the only way to reduce human infection and deaths.Public health messages for risk reduction should focus on:reducing the risk of animal-to-human transmission as a result of unsafe animal husbandry and slaughtering practices. Practicing hand hygiene, wearing gloves and other appropriate individual protective equipment when handling sick animals or their tissues or when slaughtering animals.reducing the risk of animal-to-human transmission arising from the unsafe consumption of fresh blood, raw milk or animal tissue. In the epizootic regions, all animal products (blood, meat, and milk) should be thoroughly cooked before eating.the importance of personal and community protection against mosquito bites through the use of impregnated mosquito nets, personal insect repellent if available, light coloured clothing (long-sleeved shirts and trousers) and by avoiding outdoor activity at peak biting times of the vector species.Guide on safe food for travellersInfection control in health care settingsAlthough no human-to-human transmission of RVF has been demonstrated, there is still a theoretical risk of transmission of the virus from infected patients to healthcare workers through contact with infected blood or tissues. Healthcare workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed RVF should implement Standard Precautions when handling specimens from patients.Standard Precautions define the work practices that are required to ensure a basic level of infection control. Standard Precautions are recommended in the care and treatment of all patients regardless of their perceived or confirmed infectious status. They cover the handling of blood (including dried blood), all other body fluids, secretions and excretions (excluding sweat), regardless of whether they contain visible blood, and contact with non-intact skin and mucous membranes.Standard precautions in health careAs noted above, laboratory workers are also at risk. Samples taken from suspected human and animal cases of RVF for diagnosis should be handled by trained staff and processed in suitably equipped laboratories.\n",

      "Other ways in which to control the spread of RVF involve control of the vector and protection against their bites.Larviciding measures at mosquito breeding sites are the most effective form of vector control if breeding sites can be clearly identified and are limited in size and extent. During periods of flooding, however, the number and extent of breeding sites is usually too high for larviciding measures to be feasible.RVF forecasting and climatic modelsForecasting can predict climatic conditions that are frequently associated with an increased risk of outbreaks, and may improve disease control. In Africa, Saudi Arabia and Yemen RVF outbreaks are closely associated with periods of above-average rainfall. The response of vegetation to increased levels of rainfall can be easily measured and monitored by Remote Sensing Satellite Imagery. In addition RVF outbreaks in East Africa are closely associated with the heavy rainfall that occurs during the warm phase of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon.These findings have enabled the successful development of forecasting models and early warning systems for RVF using satellite images and weather/climate forecasting data. Early warning systems, such as these, could be used to trigger detection of animal cases at an early stage of an outbreak, enabling authorities to implement measures to avert impending epidemics.Within the framework of the new International Health Regulations (2005), the forecasting and early detection of RVF outbreaks, together with a comprehensive assessment of the risk of diffusion to new areas, are essential to enabling the implementation of effective and timely control measures.\n",

About three quarters (73%) of all road traffic deaths occur among young males under the age of 25 years who are almost 3 times as likely to be killed in a road traffic crash as young females.\n",

      "The Safe System approach: accommodating human errorThe Safe System approach to road safety aims to ensure a safe transport system for all road users. Such an approach takes into account people’s vulnerability to serious injuries in road traffic crashes and recognizes that the system should be designed to be forgiving of human error. The cornerstones of this approach are safe roads and roadsides, safe speeds, safe vehicles, and safe road users, all of which must be addressed in order to eliminate fatal crashes and reduce serious injuries.SpeedingAn increase in average speed is directly related both to the likelihood of a crash occurring and to the severity of the consequences of the crash. For example, an increase of 1 km/h in mean vehicle speed results in an increase of 3% in the incidence of crashes resulting in injury and an increase of 4–5% in the incidence of fatal crashes.An adult pedestrian’s risk of dying is less than 20% if struck by a car at 50 km/h and almost 60% if hit at 80 km/h.Driving under the influence of alcohol and other psychoactive substancesDriving under the influence of alcohol and any psychoactive substance or drug increases the risk of a crash that results in death or serious injuries.In the case of drink-driving, the risk of a road traffic crash starts at low levels of blood alcohol concentration (BAC) and increases significantly when the driver's BAC is ≥ 0.04 g/dl.In the case of drug-driving, the risk of incurring a road traffic crash is increased to differing degrees depending on the psychoactive drug used. For example, the risk of a fatal crash occurring among those who have used amphetamines is about 5 times the risk of someone who hasn't.Nonuse of motorcycle helmets, seat-belts, and child restraintsWearing a motorcycle helmet correctly can reduce the risk of death by almost 40% and the risk of severe injury by over 70%.Wearing a seat-belt reduces the risk of a fatality among front-seat passengers by 40–50% and of rear-seat passengers by between 25–75%.If correctly installed and used, child restraints reduce deaths among infants by approximately 70% and deaths among small children by between 54% and 80%.Distracted drivingThere are many types of distractions that can lead to impaired driving. The distraction caused by mobile phones is a growing concern for road safety.Drivers using mobile phones are approximately 4 times more likely to be involved in a crash than drivers not using a mobile phone. Using a phone while driving slows reaction times (notably braking reaction time, but also reaction to traffic signals), and makes it difficult to keep in the correct lane, and to keep the correct following distances.Hands-free phones are not much safer than hand-held phone sets, and texting considerably increases the risk of a crash.Unsafe road infrastructureThe design of roads can have a considerable impact on their safety. Ideally, roads should be designed keeping in mind the safety of all road users. This would mean making sure that there are adequate facilities for pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists. Measures such as footpaths, cycling lanes, safe crossing points, and other traffic calming measures can be critical to reducing the risk of injury among these road users.Unsafe vehiclesSafe vehicles play a critical role in averting crashes and reducing the likelihood of serious injury. There are a number of UN regulations on vehicle safety that, if applied to countries’ manufacturing and production standards, would potentially save many lives. These include requiring vehicle manufacturers to meet front and side impact regulations, to include electronic stability control (to prevent over-steering) and to ensure airbags and seat-belts are fitted in all vehicles. Without these basic standards the risk of traffic injuries – both to those in the vehicle and those out of it – is considerably increased.Inadequate post-crash careDelays in detecting and providing care for those involved in a road traffic crash increase the severity of injuries. Care of injuries after a crash has occurred is extremely time-sensitive: delays of minutes can make the difference between life and death.Inadequate law enforcement of traffic lawsIf traffic laws on drink-driving, seat-belt wearing, speed limits, helmets, and child restraints are not enforced, they cannot bring about the expected reduction in road traffic fatalities and injuries related to specific behaviours. Thus, if traffic laws are not enforced or are perceived as not being enforced it is likely they will not be complied with and therefore will have very little chance of influencing behaviour.Effective enforcement includes establishing, regularly updating, and enforcing laws at the national, municipal, and local levels that address the above mentioned risk factors. It includes also the definition of appropriate penalties.\n",

      "Providing technical support to countriesWHO works across the spectrum in countries, in a multisectoral manner and in partnership with national and international stakeholders from a variety of sectors. Its objective is to support Member States in road safety policy planning and implementation.In addition, WHO collaborates with partners to provide technical support to countries. For example, WHO is currently collaborating with the Bloomberg Initiative for Global Road Safety (BIGRS) 2015-2019 to reduce fatalities and injuries from road traffic crashes in targeted low- and middle-income countries and cities.In 2017, WHO released Save LIVES a road safety technical package which synthesizes evidence-based measures that can significantly reduce road traffic fatalities and injuries. Save LIVES: a road safety technical package focuses on Speed management, Leadership, Infrastructure design and improvement, Vehicle safety standards, Enforcement of traffic laws and post-crash Survival.The package prioritizes 6 strategies and 22 interventions addressing the risk factors highlighted above, and provides guidance to Member States on their implementation to save lives and meet the road safety target of halving the global number of deaths and injuries from road traffic crashes by 2020.Save LIVES: a road safety technical packageCoordinating the Decade of Action for Road SafetyWHO is the lead agency – in collaboration with the United Nations regional commissions – for road safety within the UN system. WHO chairs the United Nations Road Safety Collaboration and serves as the secretariat for the Decade of Action for Road Safety 2011– 2020. Proclaimed through a UN General Assembly resolution in 2010, the Decade of Action was launched in May 2011 in over 110 countries, with the aim of saving millions of lives by implementing the Global Plan for the Decade of Acton.WHO also plays a key role in guiding global efforts by continuing to advocate for road safety at the highest political levels; compiling and disseminating good practices in prevention, data collection and trauma care; sharing information with the public on risks and how to reduce these risks; and drawing attention to the need for increased funding.Monitoring progress through global status reportsWHO's Global status report on road safety 2015 presents information on road safety from 180 countries.

      "People become infected when larval forms of the parasite – released by freshwater snails – penetrate the skin during contact with infested water.Transmission occurs when people suffering from schistosomiasis contaminate freshwater sources with their excreta containing parasite eggs, which hatch in water.In the body, the larvae develop into adult schistosomes. Adult worms live in the blood vessels where the females release eggs. Some of the eggs are passed out of the body in the faeces or urine to continue the parasite’s lifecycle. Others become trapped in body tissues, causing immune reactions and progressive damage to organs.\n",

      "Schistosomiasis is prevalent in tropical and subtropical areas, especially in poor communities without access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation. It is estimated that at least 90% of those requiring treatment for schistosomiasis live in Africa.There are 2 major forms of schistosomiasis – intestinal and urogenital – caused by 5 main species of blood fluke.Schistosomiasis mostly affects poor and rural communities, particularly agricultural and fishing populations. Women doing domestic chores in infested water, such as washing clothes, are also at risk. Inadequate hygiene and contact with infected water make children especially vulnerable to infection.Migration to urban areas and population movements are introducing the disease to new areas. Increasing population size and the corresponding needs for power and water often result in development schemes, and environmental modifications facilitate transmission.With the rise in eco-tourism and travel “off the beaten track”, increasing numbers of tourists are contracting schistosomiasis. At times, tourists present severe acute infection and unusual problems including paralysis.Urogenital schistosomiasis is also considered to be a risk factor for HIV infection, especially in women.\n",

      "\n",
      "Symptoms of schistosomiasis are caused by the body’s reaction to the worms' eggs.Intestinal schistosomiasis can result in abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and blood in the stool. Liver enlargement is common in advanced cases, and is frequently associated with an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal cavity and hypertension of the abdominal blood vessels. In such cases there may also be enlargement of the spleen.The classic sign of urogenital schistosomiasis is haematuria (blood in urine). Fibrosis of the bladder and ureter, and kidney damage are sometimes diagnosed in advanced cases. Bladder cancer is another possible complication in the later stages. In women, urogenital schistosomiasis may present with genital lesions, vaginal bleeding, pain during sexual intercourse, and nodules in the vulva. In men, urogenital schistosomiasis can induce pathology of the seminal vesicles, prostate, and other organs. This disease may also have other long-term irreversible consequences, including infertility.The economic and health effects of schistosomiasis are considerable and the disease disables more than it kills. In children, schistosomiasis can cause anaemia, stunting and a reduced ability to learn, although the effects are usually reversible with treatment. Chronic schistosomiasis may affect people’s ability to work and in some cases can result in death.1 The number of deaths due to schistosomiasis is difficult to estimate because of hidden pathologies such as liver and kidney failure and bladder cancer. WHO estimates that there are about 200 000 deaths globally each year due to schistosomiasis.\n",

      "Schistosomiasis is diagnosed through the detection of parasite eggs in stool or urine specimens. Antibodies and/or antigens detected in blood or urine samples are also indications of infection.For urogenital schistosomiasis, a filtration technique using nylon, paper or polycarbonate filters is the standard diagnostic technique. Children with S. haematobium almost always have microscopic blood in their urine which can be detected by chemical reagent strips.The eggs of intestinal schistosomiasis can be detected in faecal specimens through a technique using methylene blue-stained cellophane soaked in glycerine or glass slides, known as the Kato-Katz technique.For people living in non-endemic or low-transmission areas, serological and immunological tests may be useful in showing exposure to infection and the need for thorough examination, treatment and follow-up.\n",

      "\n",
      "The control of schistosomiasis is based on large-scale treatment of at-risk population groups, access to safe water, improved sanitation, hygiene education, and snail control.The WHO strategy for schistosomiasis control focuses on reducing disease through periodic, targeted treatment with praziquantel through the large-scale treatment (preventive chemotherapy) of affected populations. It involves regular treatment of all at-risk groups. In a few countries, where there is low transmission, the elimination of the disease should be aimed for.Groups targeted for treatment are:School-aged children in endemic areas.Adults considered to be at risk in endemic areas, and people with occupations involving contact with infested water, such as fishermen, farmers, irrigation workers, and women whose domestic tasks bring them in contact with infested water.Entire communities living in highly endemic areas.The frequency of treatment is determined by the prevalence of infection in school-age children. In high-transmission areas, treatment may have to be repeated every year for a number of years. Monitoring is essential to determine the impact of control interventions.The aim is to reduce disease morbidity and transmission: periodic treatment of at-risk populations will cure mild symptoms and prevent infected people from developing severe, late-stage chronic disease. However, a major limitation to schistosomiasis control has been the limited availability of praziquantel. Data for 2015 show that 28.2% of people requiring treatment were reached globally, with a proportion of 42.2% of school aged children requiring preventive chemotherapy for schistosomiasis being treated.Praziquantel is the recommended treatment against all forms of schistosomiasis. It is effective, safe, and low-cost. Even though re-infection may occur after treatment, the risk of developing severe disease is diminished and even reversed when treatment is initiated and repeated in childhood.Schistosomiasis control has been successfully implemented over the past 40 years in several countries, including Brazil, Cambodia, China, Egypt, Mauritius, Islamic Republic of Iran and Saudi Arabia. There is evidence that schistosomiasis transmission was interrupted in Morocco. In Burkina Faso, Niger, Sierra Leone and Yemen, it has been possible to scale up schistosomiasis treatment to the national level and have an impact on the disease in a few years. An assessment of the status of transmission is being made in several countries.Over the past 10 years, there has been scale-up of treatment campaigns in a number of sub-Saharan countries, where most of those at risk live.\n",

WHO develops technical guidelines and tools for use by national control programmes.Working with partners and the private sector, WHO has advocated for increased access to praziquantel and resources for implementation. A significant amount of praziquantel, to treat more than 100 million children of the school age per year, has been pledged by the private sector and development partners.\n",

      "Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are transmissible mostly by sexual contact and include vaginal, oral, and anal sex. Transmission is also possible through blood products and tissue transfer. Some STIs like HIV and syphilis can be transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy and childbirth. STIs can lead to severe consequences such as fetal and neonatal death, cervical cancer, increased HIV risk, and infertility. Several other infections result from risky sexual behavior. HPV, which is responsible for almost all cervical cancer, is sexually transmitted.Cervical cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the Region. Other sexually transmitted infections such as syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia, are entirely attributable to unsafe sex and still occur in several African countries.Many STIs have the effective treatment and can be cured. The incurable STIs are caused by Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Human Papilloma virus (HPV), Herpes simplex virus (HSV), and Hepatitis B virus. Prevention of STIs is through comprehensive sexuality education, behavioral change, delayed sexual debut, promotion of safer sex, interventions targeting key populations such as sex workers, STI, and HIV pre- and post-test counseling.The African region has the highest HIV burden globally, with 25.7 million people living with HIV and 1.1 million new infections in 2018. Adolescent girls have an increased risk because they are often married to older partners. The latter are more likely to have been exposed to HIV. About 31% of females between the ages of 20 and 24 in the African region were married before age 18.It is also one of the leading causes of death in the region. Efforts towards the prevention and control of disease spread include access to HIV testing and counseling, promotion of female and male condom use, use of antiretroviral medicine (ARV), and elimination of mother to child transmission of HIV (EMTCT).Approximately 85% of pregnant women living with HIV in the African region received ARV in 2018 to reduce the risk of prevention mother to child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV. The coverage was higher in the East and Southern African sub-regions (92%) than in the West and Central African sub-regions (59%). Besides, some countries have committed to eliminating mother to child transmission of syphilis as one of the key targets of the Global Health Sector Strategy on STIs (2016–2021), which reduces ≤50 cases of congenital syphilis per 100 000 live births in 80% of countries.Syphilis in pregnancy can result in fetal and neonatal death. Syphilis can be detected using a rapid test kit, and there is an effective antibiotic treatment for it. In 2018, approximately 85% of pregnant women in the African region who tested positive for syphilis were treated.InterventionsThis area's main objective is to provide guidance on strategies for controlling sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and reproductive tract infections (RTIs), including strategies to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV and other STIs and improve processes for the integration of RH and HIV/AIDS. The following outcomes are expected:improved access to, and uptake of key HIV/AIDS and SRH services, a better access of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) to SRH services tailored to their needs,improved coverage of underserved and marginalized populations, such as injecting drug users, sex workers or men who have sex with men, with SRH services,greater support for dual protection against unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV, for those in need, especially young people,improved quality of care and enhanced programme effectiveness and efficiency.For more information:The SRHR and HIV Linkages IndexSexual and Reproductive Health and Rights and HIV linkages toolkit  \n",

      "Gender mainstreaming is both a strategy for planning and a tool for advocacy to reduce harmful effects of the social determinants of health for men and women. However, health professionals are not adequately prepared to address women's and men's gender-specific health needs in their work. Special attention must be paid to particular groups who experience greater mortality and morbidity related to sexual and reproductive conditions than those in a better situation.Due to a significant societal disadvantage, girls and women have limited access to health care. As an evidence of the burden of disease related to gender inequality, it is estimated that of all adults living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa, 61% are women. Maternal mortality is also higher in developing countries than in the industrialized world. Sexual and gender-based violence affects mostly women.Therefore, public health actors must be able to identify the factors that put women and men at risk and address these factors through effective interventions. The SRH Programme and the Gender and Women's Health Programme will support countries to seek structural changes focused on people's needs to ensure universal access to appropriate quality sexual and reproductive health care.For more information:Integrating female genital mutilation content into nursing and midwifery curricula: a practical guidePerson-centred communication for female genital mutilation prevention: a facilitator’s guide for training health-care providersCountry-specific estimates of unintended pregnancy and abortion incidence: a global comparative analysis of levels in 2015–2019Learning from women’s experiences during childbirth to improve quality of careWHO recommendations on maternal and newborn care for a positive postnatal experienceWHO antenatal care recommendations for a positive pregnancy experienceDeworming adolescent girls and women of reproductive age.

      "Cervical cancer is caused by the Human Papilloma virus (HPV). It is the second most common cancer among women living in the undeveloped regions due to late presentation and inadequate services. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a group of viruses that are extremely common worldwide. There are more than 100 types of HPV, of which at least 14 are cancer-causing (also known as high-risk type).Two HPV types (16 and 18) cause 70% of cervical cancers and pre-cancerous cervical lesions worldwide.The African region has a heavy burden of Cervical Cancer due to insufficiency or lack of information and skills, lack of cervical cancer control policy, strategies and programmes, lack of collaboration and coordination of interventions, and lack of recent and comprehensive data.In 2018, approximately 311 000 women died from cervical cancer; more than 85% of these deaths occurred in low- and middle-income countries. Cervical cancer can be cured if diagnosed at an early stage.The risk of HPV infection leading to cervical cancer is higher among immunocompromised individuals.HPV vaccines have been developed and approved to prevent infection from the HPV types 16 and 18, responsible for about 70% of cervical cancer cases worldwide. WHO recommends a 2-dose schedule of HPV vaccination targeting young adolescent girls aged 9-14 years old. The recommendation is 3-doses for immunocompromised and/or HIV-infected girls.As of December 2019, only 15 countries in the African region had instituted HPV vaccination as part of the routine immunization system.WHO recommends that women of 30 years and above undergo screening with high-performance tests for abnormal cervical cells and pre-cancerous lesions and treatment. This will aid early detection when chances for cure are higher. The age requirement does not apply to HIV positive women who are encouraged to go for screening as soon as they know their status.Women identified with cervical disease (precancer or cancer) should receive treatment and care as part of tertiary prevention of cervical cancer.For more information:Human papillomavirus (‎HPV)‎ nucleic acid amplification tests (‎NAATs)‎ to screen for cervical pre-cancer lesions and prevent cervical cancerWHO Cervical Cancer Prevention and Control Costing tool: human papillomavirus vaccination module (C4P-HPV tool)WHO guideline for screening and treatment of cervical pre-cancer lesions for cervical cancer preventionHuman papillomavirus (HPV) self-sampling as part of cervical cancer screening\n",

      "There are 56 million induced abortions each year worldwide.In 2017, the African region had the highest maternal mortality ratio, estimated at 525 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births. It is estimated that 5.2% - 17.2% of maternal deaths annually in Sub-Saharan Africa are due to abortions. Abortion-related complications are hemorrhage and sepsis.Additional consequences of unsafe abortion include lost productivity, economic burden on public health systems, stigma, and long-term health problems, such as infertility.Providing Safe abortion and Post Abortion Care can help to reduce maternal deaths drastically in the Region.The laws concerning a woman's right to abortion are mostly restrictive in the African region, and this promotes unsafe abortions, which can result in high rates of maternal mortality.Most of the abortions conducted in the African countries, where it is illegal, are unsafe.Only four countries in the African region, Angola, Cabo Verde, Sao Tome & Principe, and South Africa permit abortion to be provided legally upon the woman's request, with no justification requirement, up to a certain gestational limit.It is entirely prohibited in Senegal, Mauritania, Madagascar, Guinea Bissau, Gabon, and Congo. In the remaining 40 countries in the region, abortion is restricted with legal permission only under certain circumstances.A significant challenge to understanding the severity and extent of unsafe in the African region is the absence of reliable data due to the stigma and fear attached to abortion in countries, especially when it is unlawful.Post-abortion care is the management of complications resulting from incomplete abortions or miscarriages. Health facilities (public or private) that provide primary health care services and higher levels are expected to have post-abortion care capacity.A study, which looked at the capacity of national health systems to provide post-abortion care in 7 African countries, revealed that less than 10% of primary-level facilities could provide basic post-abortion care in 5 (71%) of those countries. In addition, less than 50% of referral facilities could provide comprehensive post-abortion care.For more information: WHO African Region's Countries Abortion Health ProfilesGlobal Abortion Policies DatabaseWHO Abortion care guideline\n",

      "Family planning enhances efforts to improve family health. However, traditional beliefs, religious barriers, and lack of male involvement have weakened family planning interventions. Research has confirmed a high \"unmet need\" for family planning in sub-Saharan Africa in terms of the number or percentage of married women who say they prefer to avoid a pregnancy but are not using any contraception method.Family planning services include counseling and provision of contraceptive methods. Modern contraception methods include oral contraceptives, implants, injectable contraceptives, intrauterine devices (IUDs), condoms (male and female), emergency contraceptive pills, lactational amenorrhea method, basal body temperature method, among others.The proportion of the need for family planning satisfied by modern methods, Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) indicator 3.7.1, was 75.7% globally in 2019. Yet, less than half of the need for family planning was met in Middle and Western Africa.Approximately 17% of all women in Sub-Saharan Africa and 23% of married or in-union women have an unmet need for family planning. These women would like to stop or delay childbearing but are not using any form of contraception and are thus more likely to have unplanned pregnancies or closely spaced childbirth.Only about 28% of married or in-union women (15 – 19yrs) in the region are using modern family planning methods, and 52% have their demand for family planning satisfied by current methods.SRH Programme is supporting countries to: (i) raise awareness at policy and political level on the benefit of family planning, (ii) develop or review family planning policies, (iii) improve the quality of family planning and other reproductive health services, and (iv) foster integration of family planning into reproductive health.For more information: Family Planning in the African RegionFamily Planning: A Global Handbook for Providers. 2018 World Health Organization and Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health\n",

      "Haemoglobin disorders are inherited blood diseases that affect how oxygen is carried in the body. Haemoglobin disorders fall into two main categories: sickle-cell disease and thalassaemias.Sickle-cell disease is characterized by a modification in the shape of the red blood cell from a smooth, donut-shape into a crescent or half moon shape. The misshapen cells lack plasticity and can block small blood vessels, impairing blood flow. This condition leads to shortened red blood cell survival, and subsequent anaemia, often called sickle-cell anaemia. Poor blood oxygen levels and blood vessel blockages in people with sickle-cell disease can lead to chronic acute pain syndromes, severe bacterial infections, and necrosis (tissue death).Thalassaemias are also inherited blood disorders. People with thalassaemia are not able to make enough haemoglobin, which is found in red blood cells. When there is not enough haemoglobin in the red blood cells, oxygen cannot get to all parts of the body. Organs then become starved for oxygen and are unable to function properly. There are two major types of thalassaemia, alpha and beta, which are named for the two protein chains that make up normal haemoglobin. Alpha and beta thalassaemia have both mild and severe forms.\n",

A child who inherits two of the same trait genes - one from each parent - will be born with the disease. However, a child of two carriers has only a 25% chance of receiving two trait genes and developing the disease, and a 50% chance of being a carrier.

As a result of multiple transfusions, organs become severely overloaded with iron and a specific treatment is needed to manage this condition. Thalassaemias can be cured by a successful bone-marrow transplant, however this procedure is expensive and not readily available in most settings. Recently, gene therapy has been successfully applied to a patient with thalassaemia.The most cost-effective strategy for reducing the burden of haemoglobin disorders is to complement disease management with prevention programmes. Inexpensive and reliable blood tests can identify couples at risk for having affected children. This screening is especially opportune before marriage or pregnancy, allowing couples to discuss the health of their family. Subsequent genetic counselling informs trait carriers of risks that the condition may be passed along to their children, the treatment needed, if affected by a haemoglobin disorder, and the possible options for the couple. Prenatal screening of genetic diseases raises specific ethical, legal and social issues that require appropriate consideration.\n",

      "What is smallpox?Smallpox is an ancient disease caused by the variola virus. Early symptoms include high fever and fatigue. The virus then produces a characteristic rash, particularly on the face, arms and legs. The resulting spots become filled with clear fluid and later, pus, and then form a crust, which eventually dries up and falls off. Smallpox was fatal in up to 30% of cases.Smallpox has existed for at least 3,000 years and was one of the world’s most feared diseases until it was eradicated by a collaborative global vaccination programme led by the World Health Organization. The last known natural case was in Somalia in 1977. Since then, the only known cases were caused by a laboratory accident in 1978 in Birmingham, England, which killed one person and caused a limited outbreak. Smallpox was officially declared eradicated in 1979.Does it occur naturally?Smallpox no longer occurs naturally since it was totally eradicated by a lengthy and painstaking process, which identified all cases and their contacts and ensured that they were all vaccinated. Until then, smallpox killed many millions of people.How can I catch it and is it contagious?The virus which causes smallpox is contagious and spreads through person-to- person contact and saliva droplets in an infected person’s breath. It has an incubation period of between 7 and 17 days after exposure and only becomes infectious once the fever develops. A distinctive rash appears two to three days later. The most infectious period is during the first week of illness, although a person with smallpox is still infectious until the last scabs fall off.How fast does smallpox spread?The speed of smallpox transmission is generally slower than for such diseases as measles or chickenpox. Patients spread smallpox primarily to household members and friends because by the time patients are contagious, they are usually sick and stay in bed; large outbreaks in schools were uncommon.Weren't the remaining stocks of the smallpox virus destroyed after smallpox was eradicated?When smallpox was officially certified as eradicated, in December 1979, an agreement was reached under which all remaining stocks of the virus would either be destroyed or passed to one of two secure laboratories – one in the United States and one in the Russian Federation. That process was completed in the early 1980s and since then no other laboratory has officially had access to the virus which causes smallpox.Then why is smallpox being talked about now?Some governments believe there is a risk that the virus which causes smallpox exists in places other than these laboratories and could be deliberately released to cause harm. It is impossible to assess the risk that this might happen, but at their request, WHO is making efforts to help governments prepare for this possibility.Can it be treated?There is no cure for smallpox, but vaccination can be used very effectively to prevent infection from developing if given during a period of up to four days after a person has been exposed to the virus. This is the strategy that was used to eradicate the disease during the 20th century. New antiviral drugs, that have been developed for other diseases since smallpox was eradicated, may have a role. No studies of their usefulness, or safety, have been conducted on humans exposed to smallpox.Is a vaccine currently available?There is a vaccine against smallpox that was a key tool in the eradication of the disease. This vaccine does not contain the variola virus which causes smallpox, but a closely related virus called vaccinia. When this vaccine is given to humans, it protects them against smallpox. However, it may have rare, but serious side effects, which in extreme cases can be fatal. Since smallpox was eradicated, the vaccine is not recommended in routine immunization. It is used to protect researchers who work on the variola virus that causes smallpox and other viruses in the same virus family (known as orthopox viruses). It could also be used to protect anyone else judged to have a high risk of exposure to smallpox. The vaccine cannot be used in people who are immune depressed or immune suppressed.After the eradication programme, a second generation of vaccines was developed that used the same smallpox vaccine strains as the vaccines used during the eradication campaign. A third generation of smallpox vaccines representing more attenuated vaccine strains, was specifically developed as safer vaccines for those high risk groups with immune disorders or dermatitis at the end of the eradication programme. However as these vaccines have not been used during the eradication campaign, the efficacy/effectiveness is not known.Should the smallpox vaccine be widely used to protect people?Vaccination with the vaccinia virus as a protection against smallpox is not recommended for widespread use. No government gives or recommends the vaccine routinely since it can cause serious complications, and even death. It should be given only to those persons who have a high risk of coming into contact with the virus which causes smallpox, or who have been exposed.What can be done to protect people from smallpox?Doctors, health workers and hospital personnel around the world have been trained to identify infectious diseases, verify their diagnosis and then respond accordingly. The same system would identify any possible outbreak of smallpox even if the virus is deliberately spread to cause harm. The public health system would then be mobilized to trace all known contacts of the infected person and vaccinate them to prevent more cases of smallpox from developing. If this is done rapidly and effectively, the number of cases could be kept to a minimum and the outbreak would be contained. This was the approach which successfully eradicated the disease. Key is to have a good disease detection system in place as well as a rapid response to infectious diseases, no matter what their cause. Several governments have examined the potency and levels of their smallpox vaccine stocks, and to consider whether, and under what circumstances, to obtain additional supplies.I had the vaccination when I was a child. Am I still protected?Anyone who has been vaccinated against smallpox (in most countries, this means anyone aged 40 or over) will have some level of protection. The vaccination may not still be fully effective, but it is likely to protect you from the worst effects of the disease. However, if you were directly exposed to the virus which causes smallpox, a repeat vaccination would be recommended.What is WHO doing now?WHO coordinates various preparedness and response activities to protect global health from any possible outbreak of smallpox. WHO receives information from governments and other sources on unusual disease outbreaks. It provides technical guidance to help countries respond to these events. WHO has displayed practical information on smallpox diagnosis, surveillance, and outbreak response on its web site. It can help countries identify potential sources of vaccine, should such a need arise.\n",

      "Equity in health is an overarching principle of the World Health Organization. In recent decades, gaps in health equity between countries and among social groups within countries have widened, despite medical and technological progress. WHO and other health and development actors have defined tackling of health inequities as a major priority and aim to provide support to countries in more effective action geared to meeting the health needs of vulnerable groups.\n",
      "Meeting this goal will require attending to the social and economic factors that determine people’s opportunities for health. An intersectoral approach, though often politically difficult, is indispensable for substantial progress towards health equity. The Millennium Development Goals underscore the deeply interwoven nature of health and economic development processes, the need for coordination among multiple sectors to reach health goals, and the importance of addressing poverty and gender inequality.\n",
      "This situation raises challenges for ministries of health, which must work in innovative ways to foster intersectoral collaboration on the social and economic determinants of health even as they align key health sector specific programmes to respond better to the needs of vulnerable populations. Effective means to promote health gains for vulnerable groups include integration into health-sector policies and programmes of equity-enhancing, pro-poor, gender-responsive, ethically sound approaches. Human rights offer a unifying conceptual framework for these strategies and standards by which to evaluate success.\n",

      "Equity in health and access to health care are central themes in health system stewardship. Addressing inequity requires a comprehensive approach and action on wider social determinants on health. Health inequities are increasingly becoming a major performance issue for ministries of health and governments and feature more prominently in the policy and political discourse in Member States in the African Region. Although economic benefits and scientific advances have increased the length and quality of life for many, still close to 50 percent of the African Region are living in poverty.Harsh economic and social conditions have nurtured the growth of both communicable and non-communicable diseases. Health inequities have increased overall, particularly between population groups living in the same country. These patterns of differential health opportunity between population groups affect both middle and lower income countries alike. This is not due only to poverty. These differences in health follow a strong social gradient, which reflect an individual or population group’s position in society and different access to and security of resources such as education, employment and housing, as well as different levels of participation in civic society and control over life.Addressing inequity requires a comprehensive approach and action on wider social determinants of health, with the goals of reducing the overall gap in health opportunity in a country, and tackling the social gradient in health across the whole population.Through the work on health policy and equity, ETR works with other programmes in the Regional Office and in countries to address the underlying social and economic determinants of health through policies and programmes that enhance health equity and integrate pro-poor, gender-responsive, and human rights-based approaches.\n",

      "Alcohol is a psychoactive substance with dependence-producing properties that has been widely used in many cultures for centuries. The harmful use of alcohol causes a large disease, social and economic burden in societies. Environmental factors such as economic development, culture, availability of alcohol and the level and effectiveness of alcohol policies are relevant factors in explaining differences and historical trends in alcohol consumption and related harm.Alcohol-related harm is determined by the volume of alcohol consumed, the pattern of drinking, and, on rare occasions, the quality of alcohol consumed. The harmful use of alcohol is a component cause of more than 200 disease and injury conditions in individuals, most notably alcohol dependence, liver cirrhosis, cancers and injuries. The latest causal relationships established are those between alcohol consumption and incidence of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS.A wide range of effective global, regional and national policies and interventions are in place to reduce the harmful use of alcohol, with a promising trend over the past few decades.Alcohol consumption:Worldwide consumption in 2010 was equal to 6.2 litres of pure alcohol consumed per person aged 15 years or older, which translates into 13.5 grams of pure alcohol per day.A quarter of this consumption (24.8%) was unrecorded, i.e., homemade alcohol, illegally produced or sold outside normal government controls. Of total recorded alcohol consumed worldwide, 50.1% was consumed in the form of spirits.Worldwide 61.7% of the population aged 15 years or older (15+) had not drunk alcohol in the past 12 months. In all WHO regions, females are more often lifetime abstainers than males. There is a considerable variation in prevalence of abstention across WHO regions.Worldwide about 16.0% of drinkers aged 15 years or older engage in heavy episodic drinking.In general, the greater the economic wealth of a country, the more alcohol is consumed and the smaller the number of abstainers. High-income countries have the highest alcohol per capita consumption (APC) and the highest prevalence of heavy episodic drinking among drinkers.Health consequencesIn 2012, about 3.3 million net deaths, or 5.9% of all global deaths, were attributable to alcohol consumption.There are significant sex differences in the proportion of global deaths attributable to alcohol, for example, in 2012 7.6% of deaths among males and 4% of deaths among females were attributable to alcohol.In 2012 139 million net DALYs (disability-adjusted life years), or 5.1% of the global burden of disease and injury, were attributable to alcohol consumption.There is also wide geographical variation in the proportion of alcohol-attributable deaths and DALYs, with the highest alcohol-attributable fractions reported in the WHO European Region.Policies and interventionsAlcohol policies are developed with the aim of reducing harmful use of alcohol and the alcohol-attributable health and social burden in a population and in society. Such policies can be formulated at the global, regional, multinational, national and subnational level.Delegations from all 193 Member States of WHO reached consensus at the World Health Assembly in 2010 on a WHO Global stratgy to reduce the harmful use of alcohol.Many WHO Member States have demonstrated increased leadership and commitment to reducing harmful use of alcohol over the past years.A significantly higher percentage of the reporting countries indicated having written national alcohol policies and imposing stricter blood alcohol concentration limits in 2012 than in 2008.\n",

Globally, cannabis is the most commonly used (129-190 million people), followed by amphetamine type stimulants, then cocaine and opioids.The use of psychoactive substances causes significant health and social problems for the people who use them, and also for others in their families and communities. WHO estimated that 0.7% of the global burden of disease in 2004 was due to cocaine and opioid use, with the social cost of illicit substance use being in the region of 2% of GDP in those countries which have measured it.\n",

      "The global neonatal tetanus elimination goal was launched at the World Health Assembly in 1989 to reduce neonatal tetanus as a public health problem (defined as less than one case of neonatal tetanus per 1,000 live births in every district) in all countries.The Maternal and Neonatal Tetanus (MNT) Elimination Initiative was launched by the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), WHO and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in 1999, revitalizing the goal of MNT elimination as a public health problem. Maternal tetanus was added as it is assumed to be eliminated once neonatal tetanus elimination has been achieved.Currently, the target year for global elimination of MNT is 2015.Within the partnership1, partners bring in their own field of expertise:Countries: implementation of recommended strategies;UNICEF: coordination of accelerated activities and strengthening routine immunization to achieve and maintain MNT elimination;UNFPA: promotion of clean deliveries;WHO: monitoring and validation of elimination status, development of strategies for maintaining elimination and strengthening routine immunization.The recommended strategies for achieving MNT elimination include:Strengthening routine immunization of pregnant women with TT;TT Supplementary Immunization Activities (SIAs) in selected high-risk areas, targeting women of child bearing age with 3 properly spaced doses of TT;Promotion of clean deliveries;Reliable neonatal tetanus surveillance.Once MNT elimination has been achieved, maintaining elimination will require continued strengthening of routine immunization activities for both pregnant women and children, maintaining and increasing access to clean deliveries, reliable NT surveillance, and introduction of school-based immunization, where feasible.\n",

      "Ensuring equitable access requires a transformation in how health services are funded, managed, and delivered so that services are centred around the needs of people and communities.\n",
      "More than 18 million additional health workers will be needed by 2030 to meet the health workforce requirements of the Sustainable Development Goals and UHC targets, with gaps concentrated in low- and lower-middle-income countries.\n",

It includes the full spectrum of essential, quality health services, from health promotion to prevention, treatment, rehabilitation, and palliative care.UHC enables everyone to access the services that address the most important causes of disease and death, and ensures that the quality of those services is good enough to improve the health of the people who receive them.Protecting people from the financial consequences of paying for health services out of their own pockets reduces the risk that people will be pushed into poverty because unexpected illness requires them to use up their life savings, sell assets, or borrow – destroying their futures and often those of their children.Achieving UHC is one of the targets the nations of the world set when adopting the Sustainable Development Goals in 2015. Countries that progress towards UHC will make progress towards the other health-related targets, and towards the other goals.

It encompasses all components of the health system: health service delivery systems, the health workforce, health facilities and communications networks, health technologies, information systems, quality assurance mechanisms, and governance and legislation.UHC is not only about ensuring a minimum package of health services, but also about ensuring a progressive expansion of coverage of health services and financial protection as more resources become available.UHC is not only about individual treatment services, but also includes population-based services such as public health campaigns, adding fluoride to water, controlling mosquito breeding grounds, and so on.UHC is comprised of much more than just health; taking steps towards UHC means steps towards equity, development priorities, and social inclusion and cohesion.\n",

      "Many countries are already making progress towards UHC. All countries can take actions to move more rapidly towards it, or to maintain the gains they have already made. In countries where health services have traditionally been accessible and affordable, governments are finding it increasingly difficult to respond to the ever-growing health needs of the populations and the increasing costs of health services.Moving towards UHC requires strengthening health systems in all countries. Robust financing structures are key. When people have to pay most of the cost for health services out of their own pockets, the poor are often unable to obtain many of the services they need, and even the rich may be exposed to financial hardship in the event of severe or long-term illness. Pooling funds from compulsory funding sources (such as mandatory insurance contributions) can spread the financial risks of illness across a population.Improving health service coverage and health outcomes depends on the availability, accessibility, and capacity of health workers to deliver quality people-centred integrated care. Investments in the primary health care workforce is most needed and cost-effective in improving equity in access to essential health care services. Good governance, sound systems of procurement and supply of medicines and health technologies and well-functioning health information systems are other critical elements.UHC emphasizes not only what services are covered, but also how they are funded, managed, and delivered. A fundamental shift in service delivery is needed such that services are integrated and focused on the needs of people and communities. This includes reorienting health services to ensure that care is provided in the most appropriate setting, with the right balance between out- and in-patient care and strengthening the coordination of care. Health services, including traditional and complementary medicine services, organized around the comprehensive needs and expectations of people and communities will help empower them to take a more active role in their health and health system.\n",

      "Yes. Monitoring progress towards UHC should focus on 2 things:The proportion of a population that can access essential quality health services.The proportion of the population that spends a large amount of household income on health.Together with the World Bank, WHO has developed a framework to track the progress of UHC by monitoring both categories, taking into account both the overall level and the extent to which UHC is equitable, offering service coverage and financial protection to all people within a population, such as the poor or those living in remote rural areas.WHO uses 16 essential health services in 4 categories as indicators of the level and equity of coverage in countries:Reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health:family planningantenatal and delivery carefull child immunizationhealth-seeking behaviour for child illness.Infectious diseases:tuberculosis treatmentHIV antiretroviral treatmentcoverage of insecticide-treated bed nets for malaria preventionadequate sanitation.Noncommunicable diseases:prevention and treatment of raised blood pressureprevention and treatment of raised blood glucosecervical cancer screeningtobacco (non-)use.Service capacity and access:basic hospital accesshealth worker densityaccess to essential medicineshealth security: compliance with the International Health Regulations.Each country is unique, and each country may focus on different areas, or develop their own ways of measuring progress towards UHC. But there is also value in a global approach that uses standardized measures that are internationally recognised so that they are comparable across borders and over time.\n",

      "Despite the availability of effective vaccines against common childhood infections a significant number of children under five years of age continue to die from communicable diseases. The causes of these deaths includes: viral, bacterial, parasitic, and vector-borne diseases.Vaccines have proven to be the most cost effective public health tool in the fight against infectious diseases. Research and development of new vaccines has the potential to contribute to better immunization programmes and to reduce further childhood mortality in line with the Health related Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).Improvements in scientific knowledge and development of new technologies have accelerated vaccine development and resulted in the testing of new vaccines against common infectious diseases. More clinical trials are increasingly being planned for Africa to evaluate efficacy and safety of candidate vaccines.Contribution of Research and Development (R & D) of new vaccines to the Immunization and Vaccine Development ProgramThe role of R & D of new vaccines in supporting IVD program includes:Assisting countries to prioritize communicable. diseases so as to assist in priority-setting and resource allocation for vaccine researchBuilding capacity for scientifically valid and ethically acceptable clinical trials of vaccines in Africa.Providing guidelines and standards for vaccine clinical trials in Africa.Sustaining and/or building partnerships for vaccine research and development in order to conduct vaccine clinical trials and accelerate the introduction of new vaccines in Africa.ChallengesLack of government coordination: In a number of African countries vaccine research and development is not well coordinated.Lack of national committees: In many countries of the African Region, national ethics and scientific review committees as well as national regulatory authorities (NRAs) require strengthening.Inadequate funding for R & D: Vaccine clinical trials require substantial financial resources which is not readily available in many cases.Limited Research skills and facilities: Research requires pre-requisite skills, expertise and facilities that are often lacking in the Region.Progress and AccomplishmentsJoint Review of the Phase III Malaria vaccine clinical trial protocolConjugate meningococcal A vaccine trialRotavirus vaccine clinical trials in five African countriesCholera and HPV vaccines clinical trialsNew tools have been made available to WHO/AFRO countries to enable them to further research in vaccine development efforts.National and institutional ethics committees as well as NRAs have been strengthened to ensure that vaccine research carried out in countries in the Region is done in accordance with internationally and regionally set standards.The establishment of the African Vaccine Regulators Forum (AVAREF) has facilitated the joint review, authorization and monitoring of vaccine clinical trials in Africa.Our GoalsTo provide direction and technical assistance for vaccine R&D and the introduction of effective and safer vaccines within Africa. This goal is consistent with the WHO/AFRO strategies for achieving the health related MDGs.To sustain and/or build new partnerships in the furtherance of capacity building and conduct of vaccine clinical trials.To provide standards and guidelines for vaccine trials in Africa; and build capacity for scientifically valid and ethically acceptable clinical trials of vaccines in the Region.Our PartnersR & D partners include national governments, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI), European and Developing countries clinical trial partnership (EDCTP), Program for Appropriate technology and Health (PATH), Centers for Disease Control (CDC), Atlanta.Contact InformationDr. Bartholomew AkanmoriRegional Focal point for Vaccine Research and DevelopmentTel: + 47 241 39112Fax: +47 241 39641E-mail: akanmorib@afro.who.int\n",

However events which result in injury are not random or unpredictable.Traffic crashes, falls, burns and acts of violence such as child abuse, youth violence, intimate partner violence, and war and conflict are the main causes of injuries. Violence and injuries place heavy burdens on individuals, their families, their communities and the countries in which they live. However most of these are preventable.WHO works with partners in the prevention of domestic violence, child abuse and road traffic injuries. It is supporting country-level efforts to develop prevention approaches that focus on addressing roots causes of accidents and injuries.

      "Safe and readily available water is important for public health, whether it is used for drinking, domestic use, food production or recreational purposes. Improved water supply and sanitation, and better management of water resources, can boost countries’ economic growth and can contribute greatly to poverty reduction.\n",

      "The Millennium Development Goal (MDG 7) on drinking-water was met globally in 2010. The target was to halve the proportion of the world’s population without sustainable access to safe water. The 48 least developed countries did not meet the target, but substantial progress has been made with 42 per cent of the current population in these countries gaining access to improved drinking-water sources since 1990.\n",
      "Sharp geographic, sociocultural and economic inequalities persist, not only between rural and urban areas but also in towns and cities where people living in low-income, informal or illegal settlements usually have less access to improved sources of drinking-water than other residents.\n",

      "Contaminated water and poor sanitation are linked to transmission of diseases such as cholera, diarrhoea, dysentery, hepatitis A, typhoid and polio. Absent, inadequate, or inappropriately managed water and sanitation services expose individuals to preventable health risks. This is particularly the case in health care facilities where both patients and staff are placed at additional risk of infection and disease when water, sanitation and hygiene services are lacking. Globally, 15% of patients develop an infection during a hospital stay, with the proportion much greater in low-income countries.\n",
      "Inadequate management of urban, industrial and agricultural wastewater means the drinking-water of hundreds of millions of people is dangerously contaminated or chemically polluted.\n",
      "Some 842 000 people are estimated to die each year from diarrhoea as a result of unsafe drinking-water, sanitation and hand hygiene. But diarrhoea is largely preventable, and the deaths of 361 000 children aged under 5 each year could be avoided each year if these risk factors were addressed. Where water is not readily available, people may decide handwashing is not a priority, thereby adding to the likelihood of diarrhoea and other diseases.\n",
      "Diarrhoea is the most widely known disease linked to contaminated food and water but there are other hazards. Almost 240 million people are affected by schistosomiasis – an acute and chronic disease caused by parasitic worms contracted through exposure to infested water.\n",
      "In many parts of the world, insects that live or breed in water carry and transmit diseases such as dengue fever. Some of these insects, known as vectors, breed in clean, rather than dirty water, and household drinking-water containers can serve as breeding grounds. The simple intervention of covering water storage containers can reduce vector breeding and may also have a co-benefit of reducing faecal contamination of water at the household level.\n",

      "When water comes from improved and more accessible sources, people spend less time and effort in physically collecting it, meaning they can be productive in other ways. It can also result in greater personal safety by reducing the need to make long or risky journeys to collect water. Better water sources also mean less expenditure on health, as people are less likely to fall ill and incur medical costs, and are better able to remain economically productive.\n",
      "With children particularly at risk from water-related diseases, access to improved sources of water can result in better health and therefore better school attendance, with longer-term consequences for their lives.\n",

Increasingly countries are using wastewater for irrigation – in developing countries this represents 7% of irrigated land. While this practice if done inappropriately poses health risks, safe management of wastewater can yield multiple benefits, including increased food production.\n",
      "Options for water sources used for drinking-water and irrigation will continue to evolve, with an increasing reliance on groundwater and alternative sources, including wastewater. Climate change will lead to greater fluctuations in harvested rainwater. Management of all water resources will need to be improved to ensure provision and quality.\n",

      "WHO produces a series of water quality guidelines, including on drinking-water, safe use of wastewater, and safe recreational water environments. The water quality guidelines are based on managing risks, and since 2004 the Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality included the promotion of Water Safety Plans to identify and prevent risks before water is contaminated. In 2015, WHO introduced the concept of Sanitation Safety Plans to support implementation of the wastewater guidelines. WHO works on promoting effective risk assessment and management practices among all groups, including suppliers of drinking water, wastewater treatment companies, farmers, communities and individuals.\n",
      "Since 2014, WHO has been testing household water treatment products against WHO health-based performance criteria through the WHO International ‘Scheme’ to Evaluate Household Water Treatment Technologies. The aim of the Scheme is to ensure that products distributed protect users from the pathogens that cause diarrhoeal disease and to strengthen policy, regulatory, and monitoring mechanisms at the national level to support appropriate targeting and consistent and correct use of such products.\n",
      "WHO works closely with UNICEF in a number of areas concerning water and health. For example, the integrated global action plan to end preventable child deaths from pneumonia and diarrhoea by 2025 (GAPPD) sets out several prevention and treatment targets, including achieving universal access to drinking water in health care facilities and homes by 2030. The means of implementation for the work in health care facilities cuts across several health areas, including quality universal health coverage, and the two agencies have established a work plan to incrementally work towards universal access at the facility, national and global level.\n",

      "Mental health and injuriesSelf-inflicted injuries, road traffic injuries and drowning are among the main causes of death worldwide in adolescent girls.Depressive disorders and – in adolescents aged 15-19 years, schizophrenia – are leading causes of ill health.HIV/AIDSIn 2011, about 820 000 women and men aged 15-24 were newly infected with HIV in low- and middle-income countries; more than 60% of them were women.Globally, adolescent girls and young women (15-24 years) are twice as likely to be at risk of HIV infection compared to boys and young men in the same age group. This higher risk of HIV is associated with unsafe and often unwanted and forced sexual activity.Adolescent pregnancyEarly childbearing increases risks for both mothers and their newborns. Although progress has been made in reducing the birth rate among adolescents, more than 15 million of the 135 million live births worldwide are among girls aged 15-19 years.Pregnant adolescents are more likely than adults to have unsafe abortions. An estimated three million unsafe abortions occur globally every year among girls aged 15-19 years. Unsafe abortions contribute substantially to lasting health problems and maternal deaths. Complications from pregnancy and childbirth are an important cause of death among girls aged 15–19 in low- and middle-income countries.Substance useAdolescent girls are increasingly using tobacco and alcohol, which risks compromising their health, particularly in later life. In some places girls are using tobacco and alcohol nearly as much as boys. For example, in the WHO Region of the Americas, 23% of boys and 21% of girls aged 13-15 reported that they used tobacco in the previous month.NutritionIn 21 out of 41 countries with data, more than one third of girls aged 15-19 years are anaemic. Anaemia, most commonly iron-deficiency anaemia, increases the risk of haemorrhage and sepsis during childbirth. It causes cognitive and physical deficits in young children and reduces productivity in adults. Women and girls are most vulnerable to anaemia due to insufficient iron in their diets, menstrual blood loss and periods of rapid growth.\n",

      "HIV/AIDSFor women aged 15-44 years, HIV/AIDS is the leading cause of death worldwide, with unsafe sex being the main risk factor in developing countries. Biological factors, lack of access to information and health services, economic vulnerability and unequal power in sexual relations expose women, particularly young women, to HIV infection.Maternal healthMaternal deaths are the second biggest killer of women of reproductive age. Every year, approximately 287 000 women die due to complications in pregnancy and childbirth, 99% of them are in developing countries.Despite the increase in contraceptive use over the past 30 years, many women in all regions still do not have access to modern contraceptive methods. For example, in sub-Saharan Africa, one in four women who wish to delay or stop childbearing does not use any family planning method.TuberculosisTuberculosis is often linked to HIV infection and is among the five leading causes of death, in low-income countries, among women of reproductive age and among adult women aged 20–59 years.InjuriesBoth self-inflicted injuries and road injuries figure among the top 10 causes of death among adult women (20-59 years) globally. In the WHO South-East Asia Region, burns are among the top 10 leading causes of death among women aged 15–44. Women suffer significantly more fire-related injuries and deaths than men, due to cooking accidents or as the result of intimate partner and family violence.Cervical cancerCervical cancer is the second most common type of cancer in women worldwide, with all cases linked to a sexually transmitted genital infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV). Due to poor access to screening and treatment services, more than 90% of deaths occur in women living in low- and middle- income countries.ViolenceViolence against women is widespread around the world. Recent figures indicate that 35% of women worldwide have experienced either intimate partner violence or non-partner sexual violence in their lifetime. On average, 30% of women who have been in a relationship experienced some form of physical or sexual violence by their partner.Globally, as many as 38% of murders of women are committed by an intimate partner.Women who have been physically or sexually abused have higher rates of mental ill-health, unintended pregnancies, abortions and miscarriages than non-abused women. Women exposed to partner violence are twice as likely to be depressed, almost twice as likely to have alcohol use disorders, and 1.5 times more likely to have HIV or another sexually transmitted infection. 42% of them have experienced injuries as a result. Increasingly in many conflicts, sexual violence is also used as a tactic of war.Depression and suicideWomen are more susceptible to depression and anxiety than men. Depression is the leading cause of disease burden for women in both high-income and low- and middle-income countries. Depression following childbirth, affects 20% of mothers in low- and lower-middle-income countries, which is even higher than previous reports from high-income countries.Every year, an estimated 800 000 people die from suicide globally, the majority being men. However, there are exceptions, for instance in China where the suicide rate in rural areas is higher among women than men. Attempted suicide, which exceeds suicide by up to 20 times, is generally more frequent among women than men and causes an unrecognized burden of disability. At the same time, attempted suicide is an important risk factor for death from suicide and shows the need for appropriate health services for this group.DisabilitiesDisability – which affects 15% of the world’s population – is more common among women than men. Women with disabilities have poorer health outcomes, lower education achievements, less economic participation and higher rates of poverty than women without disabilities. Adult women with disabilities are at least 1.5 times more likely to be a victim of violence than those without a disability.Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)Tobacco use and the burning of solid fuels for cooking are the primary risk factors for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease – a life-threatening lung disease – in women. One third of all of the COPD deaths and disease burden in women is caused by exposure to indoor smoke from cooking with open fires or inefficient stoves.\n",

      "Globally, men slightly outnumber women but, as women tend to live longer than men, they represent a higher proportion of older adults: 54% of people 60 years of age and older are women, a proportion that rises to almost 60% at age 75 and older, and to 70% at age 90 and older.Noncommunicable diseasesNoncommunicable diseases, particularly cardiovascular diseases and cancers, are the biggest causes of death among older women, regardless of the level of economic development of the country in which they live. Cardiovascular diseases account for 46% of older women’s deaths globally, while a further 14% of deaths are caused by cancers – mainly cancers of the lung, breast, colon and stomach. Chronic respiratory conditions, mainly COPD, cause another 9% of older women’s deaths.Many of the health problems faced by women in older age are the result of exposure to risk factors in adolescence and adulthood, such as smoking, sedentary lifestyles and unhealthy diets.DisabilityOther health problems experienced by older women that decrease physical and cognitive functioning include poor vision (including cataracts), hearing loss, arthritis, depression and dementia. Although men also suffer from these conditions, in many countries women are less likely to receive treatment or supportive aids than men.Older women experience more disability than men, reflecting broader determinants of health such as:inequities in norms and policies that disadvantage women;changing household structures; andhigher rates of unpaid or informal sector work.These factors combine to increase vulnerabilities, and reduce access to needed and effective health services.\n",

      "Yellow fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic disease transmitted by infected mosquitoes. The \"yellow\" in the name refers to the jaundice that affects some patients.\n",
      "Symptoms of yellow fever include fever, headache, jaundice, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting and fatigue.\n",
      "A small proportion of patients who contract the virus develop severe symptoms and approximately half of those die within 7 to 10 days.\n",
      "The virus is endemic in tropical areas of Africa and Central and South America.\n",
      "27 countries are at highest risk for yellow fever epidemics in Africa.\n",
      "The burden of yellow fever in Africa is estimated at 84,000–170,000 severe cases and 29,000–60,000 deaths annually. \n",
      "In 2016, during the two-linked urban yellow fever outbreaks – in Angola and DRC – 965 cases were confirmed and around 400 people died. The epidemic created an urgent need for more than 28 million doses of yellow fever vaccines total, which exhausted the existing global vaccine supply. It also diverted public health authorities from tackling other public health issues with an impact on health systems. Additionally, 11 cases were exported to China.\n",
      "Since the launch of the Yellow Fever Initiative in 2006, significant progress in combatting the disease has been made in West Africa and more than 105 million people have been vaccinated in mass campaigns. No outbreaks of yellow fever were reported in West Africa during 2015.\n",
      "Large epidemics of yellow fever occur when infected people introduce the virus into heavily populated areas with high mosquito density and where most people have little or no immunity, due to lack of vaccination. In these conditions, infected mosquitoes transmit the virus from person to person.\n",
      "Yellow fever is prevented by an extremely effective vaccine, which is safe and affordable. A single dose of yellow fever vaccine is sufficient to confer sustained immunity and life-long protection against yellow fever disease and a booster dose of the vaccine is not needed. The vaccine provides effective immunity within 30 days for 99% of persons vaccinated.\n",

      "Once contracted, the yellow fever virus incubates in the body for 3 to 6 days. Many people do not experience symptoms, but when these do occur, the most common are fever, muscle pain with prominent backache, headache, loss of appetite, and nausea or vomiting. In most cases, symptoms disappear after 3 to 4 days.A small percentage of patients, however, enter a second, more toxic phase within 24 hours of recovering from initial symptoms. High fever returns and several body systems are affected, usually the liver and the kidneys. In this phase people are likely to develop jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes, hence the name ‘yellow fever’), dark urine and abdominal pain with vomiting. Bleeding can occur from the mouth, nose, eyes or stomach. Half of the patients who enter the toxic phase die within 7 - 10 days.Yellow fever is difficult to diagnose, especially during the early stages. More severe disease can be confused with severe malaria, leptospirosis, viral hepatitis (especially fulminant forms), other haemorrhagic fevers, infection with other flaviviruses (e.g. dengue haemorrhagic fever), and poisoning.Blood tests (RT-PCR) can sometimes detect the virus in the early stages of the disease. In later stages of the disease, testing to identify antibodies is needed (ELISA and PRNT).\n",

A modelling study based on African data sources estimated the burden of yellow fever during 2013 was 84 000–170 000 severe cases and 29 000–60 000 deaths.Occasionally travellers who visit yellow fever endemic countries may bring the disease to countries free from yellow fever. In order to prevent such importation of the disease, many countries require proof of vaccination against yellow fever before they will issue a visa, particularly if travellers come from, or have visited yellow fever endemic areas.In past centuries (17th to 19th), yellow fever was transported to North America and Europe, causing large outbreaks that disrupted economies, development and in some cases decimated populations. \n",

      "The yellow fever virus is an arbovirus of the flavivirus genus and is transmitted by mosquitoes, belonging to the Aedes and Haemogogus species. The different mosquito species live in different habitats - some breed around houses (domestic), others in the jungle (wild), and some in both habitats (semi-domestic). There are 3 types of transmission cycles: Sylvatic (or jungle) yellow fever: In tropical rainforests, monkeys, which are the primary reservoir of yellow fever, are bitten by wild mosquitoes which pass the virus on to other monkeys. Occasionally humans working or travelling in the forest are bitten by infected mosquitoes and develop yellow fever.Intermediate yellow fever: In this type of transmission, semi-domestic mosquitoes (those that breed both in the wild and around households) infect both monkeys and people. Increased contact between people and infected mosquitoes leads to increased transmission and many separate villages in an area can develop outbreaks at the same time. This is the most common type of outbreak in Africa.Urban yellow fever: Large epidemics occur when infected people introduce the virus into heavily populated areas with high mosquito density and where most people have little or no immunity, due to lack of vaccination. In these conditions, infected mosquitoes transmit the virus from person to person.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. VaccinationVaccination is the most important means of preventing yellow fever. In high-risk areas where vaccination coverage is low, prompt recognition and control of outbreaks using mass immunization is critical for preventing epidemics. It is important to vaccinate most (80 % or more) of the population at risk to prevent transmission in a region with a yellow fever outbreak.Several vaccination strategies are used to protect against outbreaks: routine infant immunization; mass vaccination campaigns designed to increase coverage in countries at risk; and vaccination of travellers going to yellow fever endemic areas.The yellow fever vaccine is safe and affordable and a single dose provides life-long protection against yellow fever disease. A booster dose of yellow fever vaccine is not needed.There have been rare reports of serious side-effects from the yellow fever vaccine. The rates for these severe ‘adverse events following immunization’ (AEFI), when the vaccine provokes an attack on the liver, the kidneys or on the nervous system, leading to hospitalization, are between 0.4 and 0.8 per 100 000 people vaccinated.The risk is higher for people over 60 years of age and anyone with severe immunodeficiency due to symptomatic HIV/AIDS or other causes, or who have a thymus disorder. People over 60 years of age should be given the vaccine after a careful risk-benefit assessment.People who are usually excluded from vaccination include:infants aged less than 9 months, except during an epidemic when infants aged 6-9 months, in areas where the risk of infection is high, should also receive the vaccine;pregnant women – except during a yellow fever outbreak when the risk of infection is high;people with severe allergies to egg protein; andpeople with severe immunodeficiency due to symptomatic HIV/AIDS or other causes, or who have a thymus disorder. In accordance with the International Health Regulations (IHR), countries have the right to require travellers to provide a certificate of yellow fever vaccination. If there are medical grounds for not getting vaccinated, this must be certified by the appropriate authorities. The IHR are a legally binding framework to stop the spread of infectious diseases and other health threats. Requiring the certificate of vaccination from travellers is at the discretion of each State Party, and it is not currently required by all countries.2. Mosquito controlThe risk of yellow fever transmission in urban areas can be reduced by eliminating potential mosquito breeding sites by applying larvicides to water storage containers and other places where standing water collects. Insecticide spraying to kill adult mosquitoes during urban epidemics can help reduce the number of mosquitoes, thus reducing potential sources of yellow fever transmission.Historically, mosquito control campaigns successfully eliminated Aedes aegypti, the urban yellow fever vector, from most of Central and South America. However, Aedes aegypti has re-colonized urban areas in the region, raising a renewed risk of urban yellow fever. Mosquito control programmes targeting wild mosquitoes in forested areas are not practical for preventing jungle (or sylvatic) yellow fever transmission.3. Epidemic preparedness and responsePrompt detection of yellow fever and rapid response through emergency vaccination campaigns are essential for controlling outbreaks. However, underreporting is a concern – the true number of cases is estimated to be 10 to 250 times what is now being reported.WHO recommends that every at-risk country have at least one national laboratory where basic yellow fever blood tests can be performed. One laboratory-confirmed case of yellow fever in an unvaccinated population is considered an outbreak. A confirmed case in any context must be fully investigated, particularly in an area where most of the population has been vaccinated. Investigation teams must assess and respond to the outbreak with both emergency measures and longer-term immunization plans.\n",

      "WHO is supporting the roll-out of the preventive mass campaigns by providing technical support to governments in coordination with other partners, and training teams to conduct the large-scale campaigns.WHO is supporting routine immunization by providing guidance on how to integrate Yellow fever vaccination at nine months with the standard measles vaccination to the five countries in Africa that have yet to commit to do this. WHO is supporting countries to increase their surveillance and build a strong laboratory network.  WHO is helping to build better national laboratory capacities and expand the laboratory network. Early this  year a second laboratory in the region, Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) in Uganda has joined Institut Pasteur Dakar as a WHO regional reference laboratory.WHO is the Secretariat for the International Coordinating Group for Yellow Fever Vaccine Provision (ICG). The ICG maintains an emergency stockpile of yellow fever vaccines to ensure rapid response to outbreaks in high risk countries.In 2006, the Yellow Fever Initiative was launched to secure global vaccine supply and boost population immunity through vaccination. The Initiative, led by WHO and supported by UNICEF and national governments, has a particular focus on high endemic countries in Africa where the disease is most prominent. Since the Initiative was launched, significant progress has been made in West Africa to bring the disease under control. More than 105 million people have been vaccinated and no yellow fever outbreaks were reported in West Africa during 2015.The Initiative recommends including yellow fever vaccines in routine infant immunizations (starting at age 9 months), implementing mass vaccination campaigns in high-risk areas for all people aged 9 months and older, and maintaining surveillance and outbreak response capacity.Between 2007 and 2016, 14 countries have completed preventive yellow fever vaccination campaigns. The Yellow Fever Initiative is financially supported by the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI Alliance), the European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO), the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), ministries of health, and country-level partners.\n",

      "              \n",
      "\n",
      "The Eliminate Yellow Fever Epidemics (EYE) Strategy was developed to respond to the increased threat of urban outbreaks of yellow fever with international spread[1]. The EYE strategy aims at building a global coalition of countries and partners to tackle the increased risk of yellow fever epidemics in a coordinated manner and is an opportunity to demonstrate new ways of managing the complex world of re-emerging infectious diseases.It has three strategic objectives: protect at-risk populationsprevent international spread, andcontain outbreaks rapidly.underpinned by five components: affordable vaccines and sustained vaccine market;strong political commitment at global, regional and country levels; high-level governance with long-term partnerships; synergies with other health programmes and sectors and; research and development for better tools and practices.No country or institution can tackle the global issue of yellow fever epidemics alone. The EYE partnership is committed to combining its effort to eliminate yellow fever epidemics to main global health agendas, including global health security, health systems strengthening, and universal health coverage. Demand for the yellow fever vaccine has recently increased due to the resurgence of yellow fever epidemics in Africa and Latin America, and the growing number of countries implementing routine immunization programmes.EYE works closely with manufacturers and at-risk countries to ensure vaccines are available in the locations and volume required.Yellow Fever vaccines are currently manufactured by four WHO-prequalified suppliers. Since 2001, annual yellow fever vaccine production has quadrupled from 20 million to 80 million doses. Output is estimated to increase even further in the coming years.The International Coordinating Group (ICG) on Vaccine Provision maintains an emergency stockpile of 6 million doses of yellow fever vaccine, funded by Gavi, which is continually replenished. This mechanism is ready to support countries to implement reactive vaccination campaigns quickly.27 high-risk countries in Africa need large-scale, preventive vaccination strategies to establish and maintain high levels of immunity among their populations. 23 out of the 27 high-risk countries have introduced routine immunization programmes, which need to be sustained with high immunization coverages[2]. 20 to 30 million children[3]  need to be immunized annually, representing an annual demand of 35 to 50 million doses. The total vaccine demand for routine immunization over the next 10 years has been estimated at 465 million dosesTarget population for preventive mass campaigns in Africa is approximately 440 million, requiring 490 million doses of vaccine over ten years.Sustained yellow fever control strategies must rely on strong surveillance and diagnostic capacities to allow for early detection of outbreaks and rapid implementation of control measures that can help mitigate the risk of spread and the use of extensive resources.By end 2018, two WHO regional reference labs are expected to be functional in Africa. Another laboratory in the region will join the Institut Pasteur Dakar to build in-country laboratory capacity by training national labs, confirming yellow fever cases, providing reagents, etc. With a faster and reliable laboratory network, countries will be able to implement faster responses.Eliminating Yellow Fever Epidemics (EYE) Strategy: Meeting demand for yellow fever vaccines[1] Steered by WHO, UNICEF, and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, EYE supports 40 countries and involves more than 50 partners. The EYE strategy was endorsed by the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) in October 2016 and approved by the Gavi Board in December 2016. The strategy will succeed by engaging countries and multidisciplinary partners, and by coordinating efforts well.[2] Four out of the 27 high-risk countries (Ethiopia, South Sudan, Sudan and Uganda) have not yet introduced routine immunization, but it is expected that they do so by the end of 2020. Kenya has already committed to increase the number of counties where routine immunization is introduced.[3] counts increasing from 2017 to 2026 due to natural population growth \n",

      "The rise in the spread of Zika virus in Brazil has been accompanied by an unprecedented rise in the number of children being born with unusually small heads—identified as microcephaly. In addition, several countries, including Brazil, reported a steep increase in Guillain-Barré syndrome—a neurological disorder that could lead to paralysis and death. Based on a systematic review of the literature up to 30 May 2016, WHO has concluded that Zika virus infection during pregnancy is a cause of congenital brain abnormalities, including microcephaly; and that Zika virus is a trigger of Guillain-Barré syndrome. Zika virus continues to spread geographically to areas where mosquitoes are present that can transmit the virus.\n",

Children born with microcephaly often have developmental challenges as they grow older. In some cases, children with microcephaly develop entirely normally. Microcephaly can be caused by a variety of environmental and genetic factors such as Down syndrome; exposure to drugs, alcohol or other toxins in the womb; and rubella infection during pregnancy.Fact sheet on microcephalySurveillance for Zika virus infection, microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndromeScreening, assessment and management of neonates and infants with complications associated with Zika virus exposure in utero\n",

Other outcomes associated with Zika virus infection in utero may involve miscarriages and stillbirths. Together, the spectrum of congenital abnormalities associated with Zika virus exposure of fetuses during pregnancy are known as “congenital Zika virus syndrome.”Not all children with congenital Zika virus syndrome present with microcephaly. On the other hand, failure to observe signs of congenital Zika virus syndrome, particularly when assessed in utero, does not necessarily mean that the fetus or newborn does not have abnormalities.

The scientific community responded with urgency to the rapidly evolving situation and began building a knowledge base about the virus and its implications extremely quickly.In 2013-2014, Zika virus had caused an outbreak in French Polynesia with some 28 000 people infected with Zika, including cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome. The outbreaks in the Americas led to a reinvestigation of the 2013-14 outbreak in French Polynesia.

If current methods are implemented in an expedient, comprehensive and sustained way, with community participation, along with other measures, mosquito control can be effective. In addition, WHO encourages countries and their partners to judiciously test new control tools that could potentially be applied in the future.WHO's vector control recommendations targeting the Aedes species are also very efficient against other mosquito vectors. The range of methods for reducing mosquitos include spraying the inside walls of houses, indoor space spraying, larval control and eliminating breeding sites. Mosquito control is recommended along with personal protection steps such as the use of insect repellents, bed nets during the day and at night, window and door netting and wire mesh screens.Dispelling rumours around Zika and complicationsProtecting the health and safety of workers in emergency vector control of Aedes mosquitoesVector control operations framework for Zika virus \n",

Plans for care and management of the baby soon after birth should be discussed with the parents in consultation with a paediatrician or paediatric neurologist where available.Women who wish to discontinue the pregnancy should receive accurate information about their options to the full extent of the law, including harm reduction where the care desired is not readily available.Women, whatever their individual choices with respect to their pregnancies, must be treated with respect and dignity.Pregnancy management in the context of Zika virus infectionPsychosocial support for pregnant women and for families with microcephaly and other neurological complications in the context of Zika virusSafe abortion: Technical & policy guidance for health systems.

The main pillars of their work, as outlined in the Zika Strategic Response Plan, July 2016 to December 2017, are:• Detection - Develop, strengthen and implement integrated surveillance systems for Zika virus disease, its neurological complications and other diseases that are transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. This helps to measure burden of disease to guide sound public health interventions.• Prevention - Prevent complications associated with Zika virus infection through mosquito control that prevents the Aedes mosquito from transmitting Zika virus, chikungunya, dengue and yellow fever to humans; communicate risks to people’s health and engage communities in prevention activities.• Care and support - Strengthen health and social systems to provide appropriate services and support to individuals, families and communities affected by Zika and related complications.• Research – 1) Generate data and evidence needed to strengthen public health and community guidance and interventions to prevent, detect and control Zika virus infection and to manage its complications. 2) Fast track and scale up the research, development and availability of Aedes mosquito control tools, diagnostic tests and vaccines.• Coordination – WHO coordinates the Zika response through close collaboration with more than 60 partners and facilitates information sharing among them and with countries.More on WHO's Strategic Response PlanZika situation report (data on occurrence and/or spread of Zika virus, microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome)Risk communication\n",

      "Blindness and visual impairment remain a public health problem in many Member States in the Eastern Mediterranean Region.  As per the latest estimate, around 40.5 million people in the Region are visually impaired and around 5 million are blind. Visual impairment and blindness and their causes have been estimated, globally and by WHO region from recent data. Recent global data indicate that 82% of blind people and 65% of those with visual impairment are over the age of 50.
