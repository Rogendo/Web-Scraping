It has become clearer that the completion of the review and unlocking of the $600 million disbursement hinges on Ghana’s official creditors swiftly reaching an agreement on specific terms of debt treatment. The AfSDJN continues to urge the IMF to actively and urgently commence deliberations on a new comprehensive, fair and effective sovereign debt restructuring mechanism based in the United Nations that would be binding on all creditors, including commercial creditors, and that would make it difficult for hold-out creditors to prevent sovereign debt workouts.\n",

      "Traditionally, the world of international cooperation has been split in a binary, where refugee responses and the creation of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) were situated in the humanitarian action field, with the consequence that help provided to refugees was reduced to specific situations of short-term displacement, assuming that the initial situation would eventually resolve and refugees would be able to go back to their countries of origin. For many crises, however, this has not been the case, given their complexity and scale. These ‘protracted’ crises, despite the language of urgency, have been at the centre of the humanitarian stage for decades. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the longest protracted situation are the more than 2.4 million Afghan refugees in Iran and Pakistan, but the situation of Syrian, South Sudanese, Somalis, Sudanese, Congolese or Eritrean refugees also qualifies as ‘protracted’, according to the definition that the UNHCR has been employing since 2004. \n",
      "The evidence of this long-term persistence of crises has been the search for durable solutions, which have been traditionally three: resettlement in another country, voluntary repatriation to the countries of origin and local integration. Yet, these solutions have not been curated by refugees themselves, but rather from the interests of the so-called ‘developed’ nations or the Global North, who have established the policies of the UNHCR through its governing body, the Executive Committee (ExCom). \n",

      "The \"Special and Differential Treatment Reform in the WTO\" by Aniekan Ukpe offers a thorough exploration of the complexities of trade law within the World Trade Organization (WTO), with a particular emphasis on the concept and reform of Special and Differential Treatment (SDT). Ukpe's work is both timely and relevant, addressing some of the most contentious issues in the multilateral trading system. At its core, the book focuses on the critical theme of reforming SDT provisions and practices within the WTO, offering a detailed examination of the current challenges and shortcomings inherent in these provisions. \n",
      "Ukpe conducts a thorough review of existing reform proposals, critically analysing their effectiveness and identifying gaps that have impeded meaningful progress. A central element of his work is the introduction of a unique, rules-based approach he terms \"differentiated differentiation.\" This method advocates for defining agreement-specific or provision-specific criteria for SDT, ensuring that eligibility is based on objective and measurable factors related to a country’s capacity to implement specific rules, rather than on broad country categorization. The book goes beyond conceptual discussion by demonstrating the practical operationalisation of the approach, using the WTO’s customs valuation agreement as a case study. \n",

      "In different epochs of our world, the idea of copyright has been thought about and debated by different scholars and philosophers. Most commonly, such debates find resonance in scholarly interlocutory about intellectual property law justificatory theories. On limited occasions, copyright scholarship ventures into studying the jurisprudence of copyright, that is the consciousness and the conscience of the discipline. In his offering, The Right to Research in Africa: Exploring the Copyright and Human Rights Interface, Oriakhogba remarkably studies copyright in the context of Human Rights. From the onset, it is refreshing that Oriakhogba takes the task of engaging copyright outside of the strict positivist and largely mercantilist strictures that often insist on thinking about copyright purely within the ambit of trade.\n",
      "The book’s argument is propounded in five chapters. Following the introduction, the second chapter examines the state of research in Africa, and the challenge that copyright poses to the question of access to information. The third chapter places its focus on international and regional human rights framework. The fourth chapter, which is the focus of this essay, discusses the national constitutions and frameworks for the protection of human rights to ascertain whether they support the development of the right to research. The fifth chapter, which concludes the book, summarily uses the insights from prior chapter’s to substantively respond to the question whether the right to research is justifiable in the context of Africa.\n",

It is on this basis that discussions about IFFs in developing countries should not be postponed.\n",
